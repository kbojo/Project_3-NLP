18 month old about to start nursery 2 mornings a week.

I started ap when lo was born. I'm the first to admit I wasn't always the best at it but I tried so hard for him and I to have a healthy attachment.
I recently had lo#2 and spent my first few nights away from lo#1. He didn't take it well, despite being explained to him over and over. The last month had been kind of difficult because I felt that the strong bond and trust wasn't there after being gone to deliver his brother. He was very needy and wouldn't let me leave his sight.
Today we made a point to hang pictures of family on the wall in his room, set up his twin bunk bed and talk about how he's growing and needs his own space.
He fell asleep without a hitch. I barely cuddled him before he was passed out.
It's now 3 am and I'm awake because he came into my room to cuddle. I let him cuddle a bit then took him back to his room. He just needed help getting warm and went back to sleep on his own with no fuss. 
I feel like this is a win. It's the first night so I'm cautiously optimistic but I'm still so excited.

"Anyone else’s babies just hate car seats, buggies etc.? Anything where they’re not physically attached to you...",AttachmentParenting,11,dfe3ut,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/dfe3ut/anyone_elses_babies_just_hate_car_seats_buggies/,9,1570638301.0,"I’ve been practising AP as best I can with my LO since he was born; he’s now 6 months. We cosleep, his naps are contact naps and most of the time if we are out and about I carry him in a sling.

This was basically what I wanted to do in the first place, however I’ve pretty much had to do it as my LO is what I’ve jokingly come to nickname a ‘Velcro baby’ - as in he just wants to be held by someone, normally me, all the time. 

As I said I don’t mind this too much as I wanted to cosleep and baby wear anyway, and I’m lucky to have a pretty good maternity leave so I won’t need to go back to work until he’s 1 - so I’m happy to curl up with him 3-4 times a day while he naps. 

However, on the occasions when I do need to put him in a car seat or buggy he is so unhappy. I could never, for example, push him round the shops for half an hour while I buy some groceries as he’d be crying to come out after 10 mins and I end up carrying him in one arm and pushing the buggy in the other. 

I purchased a running buggy last week as running was a big passion of mine before I fell pregnant and I was really hoping to be able to take him on runs with me as a way of getting some fresh air, getting in to nature, keeping me fit etc. 

However, this morning he started crying when we were about 1.5 miles from home and just wouldn’t let up, getting more and more hysterical until I eventually abandoned the run and once again ended up carrying him in one arm and pushing an empty buggy in the other. This has happened so many times now (with this buggy and the other cheap little pram I bought for pushing him around the shops) I’m starting to get anxious about taking him out in it. 

I’ve tried all sorts of things to keep him occupied/distracted but once he decides he wants to be held he will cry until he gets it. 

Has anyone else ever experienced this issue? I see so many mums pushing their babies around for hours in pushchairs, the baby even drifting off for a nap in one, and while I don’t necessarily want that as I enjoy the contact and closeness of baby wearing, I know it wouldn’t even be an option for us - we couldn’t take part in a buggy walk at a local park or join some other mums for a walk around the shops unless he was in the baby sling. 

As I said, this hasn’t bothered me too much except I’d really like to be able to use the running buggy and get out on some runs that last longer than 20 mins before he is done.

Just wondering if anyone else experienced this and any tips? Or is it a case of just meet his needs as they are now and as he gets older he’ll get a little more independent, and try again with the running then?"

I currently have a nine month old baby and practice what I guess would be considered AP.

I would like to have a second child in the future but wonder how AP works when you have multiple children to consider who may both need your attention simultaneously. I’m sure it can be done but atm my baby has 100% of my undivided attention; I worry having a second child will mean I can’t be present for either of them to the extent I am for her now.

Sleeping journey with my 7 month old,AttachmentParenting,25,ddp039,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/ddp039/sleeping_journey_with_my_7_month_old/,5,1570319692.0,"Hi, 

I started bringing the baby to bed with me and it's been great. He's 7 months now. He's crawling, very mobile, really strong, and we do it safely as possible. I'm totally comfortable with him in the bed and he's sleeping so well now. 

He goes down around 9-10 pm and sleeps anywhere from 10-12 hours a night. I typically change him 2 times a night and he eats once or twice through the night. 

Recently, I've needed some ""me time"", so I nurse him to sleep in bed and get up for a couple hours to chat with my husband and unwind.  Every time I do this he wakes every hour and I go in to help him fall back asleep. I don't want to say it's been annoying but it has...

So last night it happened again. I ended up getting out the boppy and letting him sleep in my lap while I chatted with my husband and watched tv. Baby slept right though it all! He just needed to be near me. So from now on I'm going wear him at night and do what I need to do to relax while he sleeps. 

Likewise, when we're visiting the in laws or friends and it's nap time, I put the baby in a wrap and he naps through any noise. So I'm not sure why it didn't dawn on me to do this before. 

I talked with my husband and asked him how he felt about it because sometimes I question whether I'm doing things right. He agreed that it's totally normal for a little baby to sleep better near his mother, it's instinctual and he has those survival instincts for a reason. And why would we deny the preferences of a tiny baby? We're just rolling with our instincts and will continue to avoid any ""training"". 

Just wanted to share our journey and maybe it'll help another FTM in a similar situation"

3 year old with incredibly short fuse,AttachmentParenting,16,dbzx8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/dbzx8m/3_year_old_with_incredibly_short_fuse/,39,1569993150.0,"So my wife and I follow attachment parenting, along with (what some call) positive parenting or unconditional love. We don't like harsh punishment, but we set (what we think) are reasonable boundaries based on the development of a 3yr old brain. So we understand he will have uncontrollable impulses but we make sure he knows that things like kicking, hitting, or throwing hard objects are not allowed.

One problem is that consequences at this age are difficult to execute without becoming authoritarian. We don't want to act in a way that says ""I don't love you unless you behave"" (of course, no parent stops loving their young child, but to the child it can appear that way). We will remove a toy or object he is using inappropriately, but if he's just in a bad mood and hitting us, there is not a lot we can do other than ask/tell, in a firm way, to stop.

The problem is that home life right now is just a long day of asking him to stop doing inappropriate stuff :( He is soooo grumpy. So unhappy with life. He moans about *everything*. Even when we offer him something we know he loves, he'll moan. He just moans for the sake of moaning. He hits. He kicks. He bashes his toys. He throws things. Even the objects we let him throw outside, he'll throw them in ways he knows aren't allowed - like at the windows, or at the plants, or on the roof.

Now the major complication is that life is difficult right now. We live with my parents while we are building our own home. And I mean we are literally building it. My father and I for the most part. It's been a long slog, full of problems and delay. I'm thinking of taking a month unpaid leave just to try and get further along, but the point is it's made life hard. I'm basically working 4 days a week, and building the other 3 days. It has been this way since May, or around his 3rd birthday. We have lived with my parents for 2.5yrs now, while all this has been underway.

My wife is immensely stressed out. She loathes each day alone with him. She hates having to live with my parents and having to accommodate them through our parenting (e.g. setting greater restrictions, feeling judged/watched, unable to do really messy activities). We started him at kindy in hopes he might be able to make some friends and have some fun, and so my wife can actually get things done and gather her thoughts. But so far he *hates* it. It has made his behaviour outside of kindy 10x worse. I feel like I'm continually treading water so as to not accidentally blow his tiny fuse. And what i worse is the added pressure of feeling judged by my parents because we aren't coming down harder on his bad behaviour (they won't say that out loud, but it's been hinted plenty).

We are thinking of reducing the hours he's doing, but it will depend on what the kindy allows (it's complicated with government funding, blah blah). He's currently doing every morning for a few weeks, and we planned him to do 3 full days a week. But right now we think full days would ruin him. He already comes home noticeably exhausted and overwhelmed.

It's tempting at times to just put our foot down and bring the parental wrath, but I know that isn't going to help. Or if it does, it will be at the expense of suppressing his feelings. We know it's because he is actually quite unhappy. And it breaks my heart he's only 3 and unhappy :(

I guess this was more of a therapeutic vent, but feel free to chime in."

How to Support a Highly Sensitive child?,AttachmentParenting,13,daw18g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/daw18g/how_to_support_a_highly_sensitive_child/,4,1569797147.0," 

## 1. Allow them some ""alone"" time

The most important thing for a parent with a very sensitive child is to understand them and accept them as they are. A HSC needs their own space and time to recharge themselves. This can be as important as breathing.

### 2. Show some Empathy

 A common question many parents ask is: how to help a very sensitive child? All you need is to understand and be sympathetic to them. It is important to understand that having HSC at home might mean more stares, more emotional flare ups, more pain, and more emotionally intense experiences.  It is normal for the parents of such a child to feel upset from time to time and lose their patience but you need to work on acceptance.

### 3. Approval

 Never apologize to people for the child’s emotions and sensitivity. They are born with it and every time they apologize to people for being how they are, they may feel that their emotions, sympathy, sensitivity, or the way they behave is somehow wrong. This can lower his self-esteem.

### 4. Gradually help them face their fears

 Help them do things that they are afraid of or dread in a slow and gradual manner.  This may help them overcome certain aversions. However, this should be done at a gradual pace and not in a hurry.For example, a child may refrain from wearing a cardigan because she feels itchy in it.   You might ask her to wear it for a short time to get used to it and then praise her. If the sensation begins to go away, it may be worth keeping up.   Children may find it helpful to face some aversive stimuli when it’s not harmful to their well-being, but this should not be framed or used as a punishment.

### 5. Keeping a Pet

 HSC love animals, so use their preference and make the house better by having a pet for them.   Having a pet at home will calm them down, and they will also have a companion to play with. You may want to watch out for allergies but beyond that, a pet is a great idea.

### 6. Do not use common methods of discipline for HSC

 Using common serious methods of punishment such as yelling, and others will only make matters worse for a highly sensitive child. They can respond to this by screaming, crying, and throwing angry tantrums.   Therefore, disciplining highly sensitive children should be done differently. You should talk to them and emphasize aspects like consequences and well-being, helping them better understand themselves.

### 7. Talk to your child when upset

 When you see your child crying, ask them why.  Talk to them when they are upset and validate their feelings even when you feel that the reason was minor.   Engaging in dialogue and respecting the child’s feelings is especially important with a HSC.

### 8. Help them stand against the bullies

 Highly sensitive children might cry or be different from their peers, so they have a higher risk of being bullied by other children at school. In such a situation, first of all, teach your child not to be afraid.   If such a situation arises, tell them that they should put a brave face in front of the bullies and tell the teacher about it. As a parent, you should also go and talk to the teacher and the school authorities.

### 9. Do not try to change them

 Highly sensitive children cannot help that they feel the way they do. They are born this way.   Thus, a parent should accept this and not try to change it. Attempting to change this sensitivity would only prove detrimental to the child’s overall development.

### 10. Accept your HSC and appreciate them 

 A very sensitive child is endowed with many good qualities that you can b e proud of.   You will realize that they are more caring, kind, and sympathetic to people and animals than many children their age. They are very sociable and can read a person well.   They are usually very creative and may become great writers / storytellers, actors and artists. Therefore, accept them and appreciate them for the person they are.  the whole article====> [https://www.empathsisle.net/2019/09/highly-sensitive-person-child.html](https://www.empathsisle.net/2019/09/highly-sensitive-person-child.html?fbclid=IwAR3-EWcs2USCXHU-_xp0Ua3B8SckwCCSfD17o0tfpsQxvRrGx69SfTGiWbw)"

2yr 11mth old still asking for bottles through the night,AttachmentParenting,15,da08u8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/da08u8/2yr_11mth_old_still_asking_for_bottles_through/,30,1569618895.0,"I was hesitant to post this as I was so worried about what people would think of me as a mother but from what I have seen this is a lovely community so here goes.

My daughter has had a lot of health issues since birth and been in and out of hospital and the one thing that would always settle her at night, especially in hospital would be a bottle. 

•She never has bottles through the day and eats plenty.
•I have tried offering warm water instead and she pushes it away and asks for milk.
•I’ve tried totally ignoring her and she will sit up in her cot for hours just sitting there half asleep asking for a bottle, therefore making her very tired the next day.
• It doesn’t matter if she doesn’t have a nap in the day or how tired she is, she will still wake up for one.
•She has a bottle before bed 19:30-20:00 about 180ml then sometimes she will wake at 00:00 wanting another 90ml and other times she can go through till 04:00 having 90ml and that will be the last one before she wakes up.

It doesn’t bother me getting up and doing this as it takes me less than 5 minutes start to finish and I almost do it in my sleep now I’m so used to it but I understand it isn’t good for her to still have them at night. Also she gets a better night sleep if she has them rather than sitting for hours asking me for one. A few questions if I may;

•How bad is it for her to still be doing this?
•Do you think she will just grow out of it when she is ready?
•Do you think I should just ignore her and eventually she will give up?
•Is this a comfort thing from being so poorly all the time knowing this will get her back to sleep. 

Any suggestions or ideas to help would be greatly appreciated, or maybe you have experienced this. Thanks for reading everyone."
3 year old keeps waking at 4am,AttachmentParenting,7,d9voix,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/d9voix/3_year_old_keeps_waking_at_4am/,11,1569589525.0,"I'm really hesitant to post for advice but I'm just so exhausted, plus googling ""3 year old wakes early and won't go back to sleep"" just gave me a load of ""parents don't want to wake at 5.30am"" results and Omg I would so take 5.30am right now.

My 3 year old is still breastfed, and I want him to self wean. He feeds to sleep at night, though sometimes rolls over and goes to sleep by himself. Then I sneak out of his room (usually around 7.30pm). He went through a glorious phase of sleeping til 5am or 6am and all was well. Then he started waking about midnight, and I'd go into him, settle him back to sleep and usually fall asleep in his bed with him til about 5.30-6am. Now he sometimes wakes at midnight, sometimes doesn't, but either way the 5.30am has become 4am, and he just keeps moaning that ""he can't sleeeeep"" and won't even try to lie still or rest. I can usually delay him from totally freaking out until 5am by offering boob, but then I'm still awake as although I do lie down and feed him, I can't sleep through it. He also is not the best at being quiet in the morning so ends up waking his 5 year old sister. 

I just want him to not wake up for another hour or so! Or even wake up a couple of hours earlier but then go back to sleep so he's not waking for the day til 6am. Either would work I'm just so so tired. He's gone to bed later, he's gone to bed earlier, we've dropped naps, we've reinstated naps, we've moved nap times and changed nap lengths. I've just had it really.

My husband isn't the best at night, it takes me so long to wake him up that it's just easier to deal with things myself (as once I've beaten him awake for 30 mins I'll be so wide awake and pissed off that...

But if he takes her out of bed to go downstairs for a bottle, she screams the entire time and doesn’t eat. When he brings her back up to me, she of course calms down and nurses right to sleep. She used to take bottles at night from him just fine, this is a new thing. 

I believe that babies should be allowed to have help getting to/back to sleep, that they should sleep near their caregivers, and that night nursing is developmentally appropriate and normal. But.....

I’m so tired. I can’t believe I’ve been doing this for 10 months. Coming up on an entire YEAR of never sleeping more than 3 or 4 hours at a time. I’m getting to the point where, when I have to get up, I’m very angry and feeling things that I really don’t want to feel towards her. It’s making me question how I’m parenting and thinking that we should have done everything differently - crib from day 1, night weaned a long time ago, sleep train, etc. It’s making me rethink my whole philosophy. 

I just don’t know what to do or think anymore."

separation anxiety,AttachmentParenting,4,d8oidx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/d8oidx/separation_anxiety/,8,1569366553.0,"I searched the group and read a handful of separation anxiety posts, and I think my gut knows the answer to this ""problem"" we're having, but I could use some support:

My boy is 7 months old and is only comfortable with his father and me. I'm a SAHM so I'm with him all of the time. 

Yesterday, my husband and I had to go pick up some couches so I left our baby with our family friends (they're older, 60s-70s) and he was inconsolable for the hour and a half we were gone. He did need a nap during that time, but I think he may have cried with them regardless. 

Does separation anxiety just pass? Do I need to be doing something for him? 

Right now, I think I'm going to suggest that we do ""play dates"" a couple times per week so he can grow attached to them, and after a while I will leave him there for short amounts of time. They're strongly pro ""training"", CIO, ect. and they're telling me he'd be traumatized if I were gone for a couple of days, like if I were put in the hospital. I'm feeling bad over here!

I have explained to them a bit about why I don't let him cry and a bit about attachment parenting. Ultimately, they're respectful and would do as I ask with the baby. They just don't understand it. When I picked up my son after the couch incident, the husband said ""don't you ever let this baby cry?"" Like I have been doing something wrong by meeting all his needs as he cries. I told them I'd look into solutions that fall in line with the style of parenting we're doing, but that I'm going to continue to meet his needs as he cries."

7 year old hitting,AttachmentParenting,9,d619in,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/d619in/7_year_old_hitting/,9,1568857126.0,"Hello, not sure if this is allowed but my 7 year old daughter is 80% good as gold, doing amazing in school, has the reading ability of a 11-12 year old and is generally great at most things! She’s especially helpful with her younger brother (1) who she dotes on and also her older brother (9) 

however, when she is naughty she takes it too far,
Our main problem with her recently is her attitude, I caught her out lying about her food, I didn’t shout I just asked why she had lied and she got so angry she went to hit me, and screamed at me, stamped her feet etc I sent her to bed where she continued to shout abuse at me, I ignored her and carried on with the house work and when my husband came home she laughed in his face about it and screamed some more. He’s grounded her for a month which I believe is slightly unrealistic, as I’m not sure what to do with her everyday after school?, shes had all her toys taking off her no tv etc, since being grounded she has been worse and has now even hit her dad out of anger of being grounded and her attitude is worse, she grabbed my arm yesterday and dig her nails so hard into my skin that she has left marks, she was hysterically crying once I spoke to her after she had calmed down, I explained that this kind of behaviour isn’t acceptable and we were both in floods of tears because I can’t believe she would act like this

She is the type of child who will slam doors and stomp up the stairs, if she misses a step she will go back and stamp on that step! She is so independent and head strong but like I said this is 20% of the time she’s either amazingly behaved or she’s like this! There is no middle ground really

Nothing seems to work? We’ve tried behavioural charts etc, the more she is punished the more she reacts and gets wound up, Sometimes I let things slip because it’s not worth the 3 day kick offs if she’s punished but I know she can’t just get away with everything, I don’t believe in hitting a child and screaming at her never worked either she’d just shout back. She’s currently on day 5 of being grounded and it’s just not working! We’ve sat her down and talked about feelings and it’s okay to be angry it’s how you express and deal with it but she seems like she is listening and then will kick off again 🤷🏻‍♀️ anyone got any tips?

CIO while cuddling?,AttachmentParenting,2,d3b3wp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/d3b3wp/cio_while_cuddling/,20,1568337417.0,"So we’re first time parents of a sweet three week old daughter. She was a very good sleeper in the early days but since this week she’s been much more alert and it’s hard to get her to sleep. 

Last night she woke up to feed around midnight and we couldn’t get her to sleep after for over three hours. She ended up being very overtired and started crying a lot. Normally either breastfeeding or rocking her in a dark room works, but she refused any more milk and rocking her only made her stop crying for a few seconds. Sometimes we let her fall asleep in between us in the big bed and then move her once she’s out. (She’s in a cosleeper against our bed). Last night, she kept fussing and crying even in between us. So I figured if she’s overtired we should probably stop stimulating her. We decided to just leave her in between us in the big bed, cuddle her very closely and just let her cry for a bit. She was fast asleep within two minutes. 

We don’t want to do the CIO method for sure, I don’t want to isolate her or not meet her needs. Therefore I thought to compromise to let her cry but stay very close to her and try to comfort her that way. Is this very wrong of me (as in does it go completely against AP) or is it okay?

My 19yo has adhd and was told pretty much his whole life he was gonna be a failure.  I hugged, loved and did everything I could to protect him from that while being told I was ruining him by my own parents and his teachers.  I figured out what he was good at and we went all in on it. People thought I was crazy.

As a teen he was offered an amazing opportunity and darn it if didn't he step up and take it.  He had no fear where most kids his age would have been so afraid of this limelight opportunity but he knocked it out of the park.  This kid is fearless.  He just keeps going too.  He's gonna make six figures this year at 19 yo.  He lives on his own.  He enrolled himself in college and is paying for it.  Screw you everyone who told me I was doing it wrong.  Instinct wins. These are his successes not mine.  The only thing I did right was believe he was going to be able to do it and let him believe it too.

My next one is for my 10yo.  A very sensitive child with a propensity for worry.  She is a great student but gets distraught over public humiliation for not just herself but others too.  You know teachers that call kids out for not paying attention or getting things wrong.  I have talked to teachers now for 6 years about how this affects her and it has not been easy to get across.  This year she moved up in her sport to a much more competitive team.  I talked with her coach about shame and using a different approach.  They thought I was crazy.  But, my kid is the most consistent kid on her team.  She has no anxiety over messing up and she usually scores the most points.  She is not the most athletic, she is just the kid who focuses and isn't emotional.  The coach loves her and said if he can get all the girls to be more like her he will do whatever I say.  I could explode with happiness.  Can you share your successes please?"
Son finally sleeping alone!,AttachmentParenting,39,d0eoqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/d0eoqb/son_finally_sleeping_alone/,6,1567793534.0,"This may end up being long so I apologize!

My son is 22 months old. He had colic as a newborn and has always been a high needs bub. We have always just done our best with him. I never planned on being an ""attachment parent"" but I followed my gut. I ended up sleeping with my son in a bed in his room for well over a year. I would nurse him to sleep and everytime he woke up. At well over a year old, he was still waking many times a night.

In the beginning of the year, due to becoming pregnant, my milk was drying up. So I weaned my son. He was about 16 months at the time. First we night weaned and kept a few daytime nursing sessions (mostly just weekend naps). He would wake up and cry and I'd just hold him until he fell back asleep. We were still sleeping together. After several weeks, he stopped waking at night. 

When my son was about 18 months old, I started putting him to bed and then leaving. Inevitably, at some point during the night, he'd wake up and cry for me and I'd go sleep with him til morning.

Fast forward to now and we have a new baby. I can't sleep with my son anymore. I was kind of in denial about it all and figured it would all sort itself out but it didn't. 

So this week we started to just sit in the rocking chair in his room at bedtime until he fell asleep. When he would wake up, we would go into his room and sit in the chair until he fell back asleep and then leave. Mostly, it was my husband doing this because I stayed with the baby. But I did bedtime once. 

At any rate, the first night, he woke up 4x. The second night, he only woke up once. Last night, no wakeups!!! 

I am so incredibly proud of my boy and so glad we never ""sleep trained"" him. Sleep training may be right for some kids/families but I feel in my heart that we did what was right for our son in the right time.

Just wanted to share in case it helps anyone else.

UPDATE: After the night with no wakeups, the next two nights he had one wakeup each, but each time it just required one of us to go in his room for about 2 minutes and sit in the chair. I'm so proud of my boy :)"

I am always afraid to leave the baby for slightly long stretches because of breastfeeding. So I’m always at home, always with her, rarely doing anything alone. She does not sttn and still wakes 2-5 times each night to nurse. Since my supply isn’t super abundant, I’m always afraid of a drop, so I feel like I can’t have my husband do many night feeds to give me a break. With the exception of her sttn two nights in a row last week when we attempted to sleep train, I have not slept a stretch longer than four hours in nearly ten months. It’s wearing me down.

I am starting to get really angry every time she wakes. Even though I know it’s irrational, it makes me feel resentment towards her. And I feel so much resentment towards my husband even though I know he’s obviously limited in what he can do. I’m constantly in a horrible mood and I’m not being the mom I want to be. I’m stuck between feeling like I *am* being the best mom I can be, by AP, but also feeling like it’s having the opposite effect and that maybe I’d be better, and my kids would be better off, if I stopped BFing and started sleep training."
Need to vent,AttachmentParenting,22,cyj2lm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/cyj2lm/need_to_vent/,17,1567419972.0,"

Ok guys. So I need to vent. I've lived in my apartment for 2 years now. Became friends with my neighbors since our daughters are the same age (3). My friend spanks, I dislike it but you can't change someone's parenting style. Im from Massachusetts but am raising my babies in Tennessee (vet school and that's where hubs lives). Recently I've been getting very irritated with the comments my so called ""friend/neighbor"" have been saying referring to my kids (who are 2 and 3).

""You northerner won't spank and now your kids are spoiled brats""

- while one of my kids are expressing there little emotions either by yelling or playing to loud, or God forbid throws a normal toddler tantrum I get this response ""id whip there ass or smack there mouths if I were you, what's wrong with you Karla"" 

But last night went to far.....

While my toddler rode her bike towards the adults to ask me a question this ""friend"" had the audacity to spank my child. My daughter then instantly pushed her bike over and she spanked her again. (This happened within 2 seconds of each other) now I don't like confrontation but I was ready to punch this chick. I took the kids and walked away but of course her 3yo followed. So I had the kids play away after I had to calm my screaming confused toddler. I voiced my opinion nicely to her and thought all was ok. My daughter then wanted a little hug from said friend (bless her heart) since she thought said friend was mad. Said friend wanted NOTHING to do with my daughter,  no affection, no smiles, nothing.  

What in the actual f*ck is wrong with people.  
 This broke my heart. Needless to say we will be going to the park instead of outside every night. I don't need to be around people like that and neither do my children.  We will see her friend if and when I babysit her. I told my fiance and he was livid. He knows that we raise them different than most people down south but theres a line you just don't cross."

For example, since birth I've mostly done my son's bedtime and husband has done daughter's.
Even after a year of doing her bedtime it still takes him twice as long to get her to sleep then it does me. Same with our son, about twice as long.

Daughter starts jk on Tuesday and I know it's going to be a hard transition so I feel I need to start doing her bedtime. But then I know the baby won't be sleeping as well and will be raging to sleep. But if I stick with my son she'll be upset because she wants me and won't be getting enough sleep before school.

There's no win here and I'm not really looking for an answer. I'm just sad and stressed and want to vent."

UPDATE: My sensitive 8 year old is about to start 3rd grade and the teacher has a very bad reputation.,AttachmentParenting,18,cxigbj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/cxigbj/update_my_sensitive_8_year_old_is_about_to_start/,2,1567207610.0,"Link to original post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/cwsts3/my\_sensitive\_8\_year\_old\_is\_about\_to\_start\_3rd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/cwsts3/my_sensitive_8_year_old_is_about_to_start_3rd/) 

So I called the school (I wasn't able to visit in-person, because I'm home with the kids all day and my husband was at work, and I did not want to have this discussion in front of my daughter). I talked to the Vice Principal (actual Principal was away) and I calmly and rationally explained my feelings and apprehension. I requested that she get a transfer.

He said it was not possible at this time to get a transfer, but that he totally understood where I was coming from and it wasn't the first time a parent had called with similar worries. I was disappointed that they couldn't put her in a different Grade 3 class, but I do feel somewhat bolstered by how seriously the VP took my concerns. He said that they will spend extra time popping into that classroom to monitor, and that they will do whatever they can to make my daughter feel comfortable should any issues come up.

That being said, I have witnessed another teacher (a Grade 1 teacher) who made a child cry because he did not tie up his ice skates fast enough. When I told the principal what I'd witnessed, he totally backed the teacher. My mother says it's because the teacher's union is so strong, that, in her words, short of being a paedophile, there's nothing a teacher can really do to be fired in this country. 

I did tell the VP that if a situation does arise that causes my daughter anxiety, I will be asking for a transfer later on, and will insist upon it. Failing that, I'd have to enroll her in a school about 15 minutes from here, but I'd really like to keep her at this current school. All the teachers she's personally had since Kindergarten have been wonderful. It seems like the teachers at this school that are yellers and mean-spirited are the old ones that need to retire! 

We do a lot of mindfulness in this house, and I'm just going to ramp that up ahead of school starting. I meditate with my daughter (the Calm app has a wonderful kids' section), we have a Big Life journal and we listen to the Big Life podcast. All my husband and I can do is love her and support her as much as we can at home and hope that everything works out!

I want to thank you all for your insight and helpful comments. The AP journey can raise some eyebrows, and in the back of my mind I was worried about seeming like a helicopter parent. But I was bullied mercilessly throughout middle school, and the teachers did NOTHING. It definitely contributed to my anxiety and depression, so I can only imagine how hard it would be to have similar treatment from a teacher! 

I also want to thank everyone who shared insight into ADHD. I'm going to remain open minded and look more into it, for sure. 

I hope all of you with school-aged children have a wonderful start to the new year and a brilliant school season in general."

My sensitive 8 year old is about to start 3rd grade and the teacher has a very bad reputation.,AttachmentParenting,15,cwsts3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/cwsts3/my_sensitive_8_year_old_is_about_to_start_3rd/,11,1567064393.0,"Hi everyone!

My husband and I have been practicing AP since day one with both our eight year old girl and our four year old boy. 

Its turned out wonderfully. Our 8 year old daughter is an incredibly kind, friendly and intelligent child. She's always gotten along wonderfully at school and has been quite ahead of the curve in almost every subject. But we have always emphasized to her that what we are most proud of is how often her teachers have commented to us that she has a heart of gold, is a wonderful friend and little human being. 

That being said, she is not perfect. She is a bit dreamy, and her work can be messy. We work with her on both these issues. The dreamy thing I actually don't think is anything negative. But she is the kind of kid that will take a bit longer than others to do some things because she might be thinking of other things. No, she does not have ADHD, lol! None of her other teachers have commented on this, it's just something I as her mother notice. 

When we found out who her grade 3 teacher was going to be we didn't know anything about this lady. But we have heard from at least five people, from all different walks of life (from my mom friend whose son had her to my son and husband's barber whose kids had her). And today I found out that she yells. A lot. 

We don't yell. Its just not in our nature, mine or my husband's. I grew up in a house where my dad yelled all the time and it scared me. I am not inclined to be an angry person and I've always found that reasoning works much better. 

But my daughter is very sensitive to disappointing people. I can tell my spirited son something in a firm tone, because my gentle tone didn't work, and he will give me a cheeky wink. If I use the same tone with my daughter, even though it's not a mean tone and it's not anywhere near a yell, she will feel really badly about herself.

She has always felt guilt very easily, and is very hard on herself. Not so much when she makes a simple mistake or gets something wrong, but when she thinks she has hurt someone's feelings or something like that. 

My husband and I make efforts to tell her and my son that we all make mistakes, and we learn from them. We do not overreact and we have a healthy attitude to expectations. 

My worry is that having a teacher that is a yeller is going to be hard on her. She already had a small amount of anxiety with school because she misses me a lot. 

One mom told me she had to request a change into a different class, so that's always an option, if they still do that. But it's the only school in our whole town, which is quite small. 

I know it's a good learning experience for her to know how to deal with difficult people, but she will have to spend countless hours with this teacher. She is a highly sensitive little girl and I don't want her to be hurt.

Am I worrying overmuch?"

We have been AP with my 9mo old; breastfeeding, wearing, bedsharing since birth, nursing to sleep, etc. I’ve loved every part of it and feel that it’s best for us. 

Now that she is mobile, I am worried she’ll crawl out of bed onto the wood floor if she’s in the room alone. We can’t afford the big bed rails and I don’t want to put the mattress on the floor because we have no place to store the box springs and bed frame (the box springs would still make it too high off the ground). I also have, admittedly, been getting worn down by the constant night feedings, every 2-3 hrs for 9 months. We decided it made the most sense, and was the safest option, to sleep train and crib train. 

I have read recent [studies](https://aasm.org/resources/practiceparameters/review_nightwakingschildren.pdf) showing that CIO does not cause long-term damage and I have been okay with letting her cry a little bit. At night it works wonderfully and she was STTN on night two. For naps, it doesn’t work. 

The problem I’m having is I can’t shake the feeling that this isn’t what I want to be doing. On one hand, it absolutely is - because 1) I know, after bedsharing for 3 years with my first, it gets MUCH more difficult the older they get, 2) I have not been getting any sleep for 9 months, and 3) The safety issue. 

But, I also love snuggling with her. I love nursing her. I love comforting her. She is my last baby and I feel this strong need to savor every moment and really commit to the most gentle parenting approach that I can. 

I would love to hear from anyone that has experienced something similar. My head is just spinning and I’m tired of being so conflicted."

He fights sleep like we're tortuing him, be it naps or nighttime. He SOMETIMES sleeps for the first 4 hours we put him down but for the most part he's up to feed every 1.5 to 2 hours. We've been sticking to the attachment parenting style by accident thus far and need some advice about how to get him down for some period longer than 2 hours. We can't keep the pace of holding him for every single sleep and the lack of sleep is definitely affecting the 2 of us. 

Background: He's our first and is 5 months, higher than 95th % in everything but his average head size. Bassinet sleeping (next to the bed) since birth until the last ~2 months where we've been co-sleeping. Mom stays home with him. Tried blended up solid food but thought that maybe the diet change was hurting his stomach. We think we've tried just about every technique besides crying it out, which we refuse to do (much to our own mothers' shagrin). 

The questions:
1. What are we doing/not doing correctly as far as attachment parenting goes? We're new and tired
2. At a certain point do we just need to give him exactly what he wants and hold him so he can sleep? He'll keep himself up for 6+hours during the day after only getting 6 hours at night. I would have thought he'd just get tired and fall asleep eventually, but I would be wrong in that assumption.

For naps (she is still doing 3 naps) I nursed her to sleep then after 15-20 minutes or so I detached myself and sat at the end of her futon. She'd sleep for 30 - 45 minutes on her own before waking up. One nap she woke up crying so I nursed her back to sleep and she slept another hour. 

For bedtime, I put her in her weighted sleep sack and then nursed her to sleep around 8:30. Had to nurse her back to sleep me at 9:30 and 10:30, but then she slept from 10:30 to 2 am on her own. I brought her to bed with me and nursed her back to sleep and she bed shared with us until morning

I hope that your day is going well. I am a FTM to a 10-month-old girl. I had always wanted to bed share, but was too scared to at first. I struggled pretty badly with PPA, and was so worried about SIDS. Now that my PPA has passed and my daughter is older we have been bed sharing more and more. It started out only in the mornings and is sort of moving earlier and earlier. Also, we are being hit pretty hard by teething and my little one just wants to be close more. I would be fine bed sharing full time, but there are a few obstacles. I have moved my mattress to the floor and was feeling pretty comfortable. However, my DD is a very active sleeper and last night rolled off of the mattress in her sleep. Poor little thing woke up screaming and I think the fall scared her. I am not sure what to do to protect from this. I have pretty much moved everything out of our room like dressers and my clothes rack (our apartment doesn’t have closets sadly).  We have a crib that can turn into a toddler bed and I have thought about setting that up and making it flush with out mattress. 

What are your bedsharing setups? Do you use bed rails? Any tips, tricks, advice, or experience that you can share would be very much appreciated!

A little extra info:  my husband is away on business for the next few months so it is only me and DD in the bed. I am pretty aware of her when I sleep except when really exhausted and I try to put her in her crib on those nights for at least 3 or 4 hours. I don’t drink or smoke. I am not currently breastfeeding. Sadly I had to stop because of a medication I needed to begin taking.

Thanks again!"
Trying to transition my DD (9 months) from bed sharing to sleeping on floor futon,AttachmentParenting,12,cqjmic,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/cqjmic/trying_to_transition_my_dd_9_months_from_bed/,7,1565863642.0,"I got an awesome floor futon for my DD. She is currently nursed to sleep most of the time, sometimes rocked, and she sleeps in our bed with one of us laying with her (usually me). She's had a crazy sleeping life because we moved to another country (Japan) and it's been a long journey. 

To summarize it, she's gone from a rock n play next to our bed (before the recall), to a swing, to a cosleeper in bed with us, to just our bed (but this is before we found AP and we felt wrong so we tried to avoid it), back to the swing, and now we've been purposely bed sharing (and actually sleeping well) for 2 months.

However, I'd like to have her sleep on her own for naps, and in the evenings, so I can get stuff done and just be baby free for a bit. 

She detaches easily from nursing, and I can lay next to her for the most part and she will sleep at least an hour for naps. But shortly after my husband or I leave she will wake up. I think she can tell when there is no body heat next to her. 

I want to make sure the futon stays a positive experience. I don't want her to learn or associate it as the place mom and dad leave me alone at. Currently only on day 2, and I've been nursing her to sleep, then laying in my bed which is next to her futon. if she wakes up I try nursing her back to sleep and reoeat. 

Any tips or tricks to keeping the experience positive but also eventually working our way to me being able to leave the room would be awesome!

Teething ruined my baby’s sleep - help!,AttachmentParenting,5,cq2zka,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/cq2zka/teething_ruined_my_babys_sleep_help/,11,1565776303.0,"My little girl is 11.5 months old and a late teether. Her first tooth (lower middle) just came through three days ago, it’s barely in now, just a little sliver, but we can see her upper front two getting ready (swollen gums, etc) so I think we’re getting a few in a row. We are new to this teething thing and having issues with her sleep.

For the first 11 months we had a decent routine sleep wise. We either rock (dad) or feed her (me) to sleep, then transfer her easily to the Pack and Play next to our bed (originally a Halo bassinet). She’d wake at 11, 3 and 5 needing cuddles/boob but would go back down easily in under a minute. After she was about 4.5 months old usually at either the 3 or 5 am wake I would start bed sharing with her. All this was fine. 

But since the teething started a week ago, she will still fall asleep quickly just as usual but she won’t let us transfer her to the Pack and Play. For her first stretch of sleep or any after. She goes to sleep easily but wakes as soon as we put her in the cot or sometimes it doesn’t even get that far and she wakes when we move her. She is not crying orb seeming to be in pain (we tried baby Advil - no change) and she still falls back asleep quickly when we pick her up, but we can’t put her down without her waking. She will sleep while either being held or lying in our bed with someone next to her, so my husband and I have been swapping off. I take 7-9, he takes 9-11, then I go to bed and co-sleep. She’s also been very clingy during the day too, wanting to be held or climb on me a lot more than before.

What can we do? She might still be teething but we are worried she just likes the new arrangement. Cushy bed, cuddly parent, I’d like it more too! My husband and I basically don’t see each other at night anymore or eat together and it’s hard to get things done. We’re struggling. We are more on the attachment parenting end of the spectrum and I will not consider CIO or the like, but we can’t keep going to bed with her at 7. We never see each other. What can we do? Just push through? Any advice or commiserations welcome."

Searching on the other subs leads to lots of “it only got better once we sleep trained” so that’s depressing  af and we obviously won’t be doing that.

I’m doing everything I can to just ensure we all get as much rest as possible- cosleeping sometimes (not great as baby kicks and scratches me while feeding so I don’t get much rest), laying down to feed during the day, eating well and getting enough water, my spouse is supportive and does their bit etc.

I’m not expecting my baby to suddenly start sleeping 12 hours straight, and I know that it will obviously get better eventually (it’s not like it’s going to last till he’s 18...) but I need to know that there’s more than 60-90 minute stretches of sleep on the horizon, not in 3 years time.

Anyone?

ETA: I would cosleeping and breastfeed all night long if that’s what it took, but we are now getting wakeups where he is no longer hungry so won’t comfort nurse back to sleep, and is generally up for an hour or two before being tired enough to go back to sleep or start naps for the day.

My hope is that over time as we start solids and he needs less night feeds, he spends more time in his cot and less cosleeping, as he is becoming very active in his sleep and this keeps me awake (but I still get more rest cosleeping than getting up for every feed right now). 

I’ve basically been shoving a boob in his face every time he stirs/wakes up since birth, but last night I tried resettling him in his cot and it worked, just by stroking him a bit. I’d love to do this more often with a view to him spending more time in the cot BUT I’m so tired that during the night I just grab him, latch him on and go back to sleep myself without really knowing what I’m doing.

He demands doing all kinds of stuff and other times he asks for help. Tonight I got angry with my husband. His deal with our son is that if our son puts on his pull up himself and his pajamas and brushes his teeth that they do airplane spins and hide and seek before bed. Tonight my husband said he wouldn't do that with our son because our son hadn't done those things and our son was asking me to help him with his pull up and pajamas. I should not have said anything to my husband in front of my son, but I did and told him not to shame our son for not doing those things and that it's okay for our son to ask for help. This led to, a few minutes later, our son looking down at the ground and sad and taking off his pajamas and pull up to put them back on himself so he could do the airplane spins and hide and seek. Thinking about his little self right now doing that breaks my heart and makes me angry. I told him he didn't have to do that and he wouldn't stop. He wanted to. My husband says he's trying to build confidence in our son. I should also note that my husband did say that because our son did brush his teeth by himself that they would do airplane spins so it's not like he wasn't going to do anything fun.

My baby just turned 10 months. He's pretty much always bed shared/nursed to sleep for nights his whole life, whilst for naps he's very good at just nursing then being put down in a bassinet/crib.

Since he was about 8 months, he's kinda created his own nap/sleep routine. Wake at 8am, first nap at about 10am for about an hour to hour and a half. Afternoon nap at 2:30pm for another hour and a half, bed time sleep at 8pm.

He is on solids now, and has breakfast, lunch, snack and dinner.

He has his two bottom teeth already, and I can see his two top 'eye' teeth are close as well. 

Ok, so now the scene is set, the last I think 3-4 days or so, he's been having serious trouble with naps all of a sudden. He is now fighting them, and will only nap for 45 mins TOPS per nap. It's more like 20 min ""crap naps"".

Saying that, his temperament is normal. He's not fussing, upset, yawning etc.

I've got no clue if there is some kind of magic time when he might only want 1 nap or something? Should I just do what we've always done and just follow his cues?

I'm having a slight dilemma with regards to responsiveness at nighttime and I'd love your opinions/insight.

Recently, we moved our little guy to his crib as he's outgrown the bassinet. Crib is in our room just a few feet from the bed and I'm in no rush to move him to a separate room. He's started rolling over in his sleep and much prefers to sleep on his belly, however we always put him to sleep on his back. The issue is that he'll roll onto his belly in his sleep and I think be... surprised that he's suddenly there? He might make some whiny sounds and give out like one single cry, followed by a long silence before sucking on his hand and going back to sleep. If/when he ever escalates to an actual cry for more than a few mins, I'm happy to get out of bed and soothe him.

I've read some literature that suggests I should be going to him every time he makes a peep, but I'm wondering if that would just delay his ability to realize he loves sleeping on his belly? What do you guys think?

Baby sleep schedule or sleep cues at 8 months?,AttachmentParenting,2,cmvkip,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/cmvkip/baby_sleep_schedule_or_sleep_cues_at_8_months/,6,1565151066.0,"So any other sub (except my month sub) would tell me to sleep train my girl for naps - and appear horrified when I’d have to say she isn’t sleep trained for nights, so asking for your thoughts.

My girl just turned 8 months and I’ve got no idea if putting her on a schedule would be better than following her sleep cues.  

She is still taking 3 naps a day - sometimes only two but that because we abort the second if she won’t fall asleep after an hour or so of rocking, cuddling, shushing, dancing on a circus ball while hula-hooping.  She goes to bed between 6:30-7pm and is up between 5:50-7am, up between 2-6 times a night (2-3 feeds, the other times we can settle her without).   Her first and second naps are *usually* in her crib (rocked, bounced, etc to sleep) while her last one is always in her K’tan carrier - cuz snuggles and I’m guaranteed a longer stretch.  Her first nap is usually 2-2.5 hours after waking up regardless of when she wakes and can be 42 minutes or sometimes the coveted 1.5 hours.  The second nap is usually about 2.25-2.5 hours after last nap and is usually only 38 minutes.  The last one varies greatly but I end it at 4:10pm so she’s ready for bed.

So, she seems to have short wake windows -2-3 hours max at 8 months.  Is this normal or should I try to stretch her wake windows? I want to follow her lead but not sure if I’m hindering her somehow by “letting” her have such short wake periods. Is following her sleep cues at this age ok still or would a schedule be better? Nap at 8:30, 12:30, and 3:30? If a schedule is better, what do I do with the short cat naps? When she gets overtired her night wakings go way up so we put her to bed early but I worry if she consistently goes to bed for 6pm her morning wakeup will shift earlier - and while I love my morning snuggles and am an early bird, I rather enjoy a hot cup of coffee by myself before the world wakes up.

We’re eventually planning to have four kids in total, and I’m curious as to how far apart other AP parents have spaced their children. On one hand, I feel like too far apart in age (3-4 years) could lead to too much of an age gap for the kids to be able to  be into the same things at the same time and not be as close relationally, but this would also allow me as a parent to get to focus on the new baby while the older one is in preschool.

LO is going to be 3 at the end of next month. She has always been home with me, hasn't gone to preschool yet. Occasionally she stays with my husband if I need to run an errand, etc., but she's more than likely to ask to go along even in those cases. I will be the first to admit that she's clingy, but I don't really notice anything else amiss with her development. She tends to be a pretty cautious, shy type in general and I think the clinginess is associated with her personality more than with having been with me a lot. 

My inlaws are forever asking for her to stay with them, alone, without me or my husband there. I have no idea why and it's kind of bizarre to me tbh since my family has never even mentioned anything like that. Often when they visit, I'll jump at the chance to run out for some groceries or something, while Dad stays behind with his family, so it's not as if I won't let her out of my sight or anything extreme. 

LO says she doesn't want to be alone with them. She's told me before that they make her feel shy and nervous (MIL is extremely overbearing, in-your-face, and loud, and we are by contrast a very calm, laid back family, so I'm sure this doesn't help), and that she does not want us to leave her with them. So I told my husband this. He still wants to try to get her to stay with them, because I think he's gunning for a dinner and movie deal with me, which obviously would be nice, but not at the cost of seriously upsetting LO when she's plainly stated they make her nervous and she doesn't want to be left with them. 

The thing is, I am pretty sure that if we just quietly slip out, or leave while she cries for us, that will be the death knell for any kind of trusting relationship she might have otherwise had with the inlaws. I know my kid, she's smart and she remembers *everything*. It's going to go from ""yay, Grandma and Grandpa are coming over"" to ""NOOOOOOO! I don't want them to come here!!"" I explained this to them yet they keep insisting she'll be fine if we just leave her. 

Who's right here? Am I being nuts? Are they as weird as I feel like they are for demanding this?"

But you know the worst part? As a newborn, my baby could have cared less if we coslept or he was put in a cot. Until he was three months old he actually preferred sleeping without touching anyone. But I put him in our bed anyway, because it felt like the natural thing to do. I’VE created this situation. I have no doubt he would’ve be content alone if we had slept apart from the get go, but now he has to be physically touching me (and only me) to go and stay asleep.

Anyway, there’s my rant. I don’t feel like I can stop cosleeping until he’s weaned, as he only nurses to sleep for naps and bedtime. Here’s to another 6-12+ months of this. I won’t make the same mistake with his future siblings, but with my luck they will be the ones that come out needing to cosleep."

I can't because I would stress and be horribly anxious but I am just tired and fed up of being a little persons constent entertainment, feeding machine, punchbag and soother. 

He doesn't sleep well. He goes down okay at 7 and then is up for an hour around one and then up every hour for about 15 minutes after that and then up for the day at 4:30. This morning I actually sat him in front of 'in the night garden', I have never used screens before I was just desperate. That didn't work either though as he wants me to sing, read, play with him etc. I really felt angry towards him and then really really guilty afterwards as I know he isn't doing this on purpose.

Sorry for long rant, I am just feeling a bit shitty today.

I'm writing today because I'm feeling a little judgy. My SIL had a baby a few days ago and came home from the hospital yesterday. She already has baby sleeping in the crib in a room down the hall from their bedroom. 
Her husband is very self-centered (that's another story) and I had a feeling he'd push against biology and focus more on sleep training.
I just can't help but feel so bad for this new sweet baby. I've co-slept since birth and still BF (DD just turned 1) so putting babe in a whole other room sounds crazy to me. I used a bassinet next to our bed once or twice at most.

I guess I feel bad for judging my SIL so hard, as I know being a new mom (especially a NEW new mom) is hard and everything is trial and error. I know everyone will choose a different path, but my heart just breaks for this tiny being. All she's known for the better part of a year is the warmth and comfort of a womb.

How have you dealt with family members like this in the past? I don't feel comfortable enough to pry into her and don't feel that's right. Thanks all!"

Hate that I love co-sleeping because I want my bed back,AttachmentParenting,18,cgyp0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/cgyp0f/hate_that_i_love_cosleeping_because_i_want_my_bed/,23,1563945731.0,"tl;dr - Have been co-sleeping with my 7mo old son and I've gotten addicted to the ease of being able to nurse him back to sleep. How easy/hard was it to transition baby back to crib?

Some background.. My son is almost 7 months old. Between when he was about 3 1/2 months to 5 1/2 months, he was sleeping in his crib. At first, it was difficult to get him to fall asleep (and stay asleep) but it's gotten progressively better. For the few weeks before he turned 6 months, he would simply fall asleep nursing and I would then just transfer him to his crib. He'd wake up twice throughout the night and I'd nurse him back to sleep. After the second time, usually around 5am, I would just let him finish sleeping in my bed. That was my ideal situation and I thought we had finally gotten a good night routine.

However, in the past few weeks, he started to wake up more frequently and was harder to transfer into the crib. He would wake up the second his head touched the crib mattress or within an hour of putting him down. It made me so tired that it eventually led us to co-sleeping. At first, I blamed his crappy sleep on the 6 month sleep regression. Then I blamed it on teething. Now, I'm blaming it on the 6 month vaccinations he received yesterday. 

I love co-sleeping because it's so easy for me to nurse LO back to sleep if he wakes up. But regardless of whether or not I shot myself in the foot and let LO (and myself) get comfy with co-sleeping or if it's because of a regression/teething/vaccinations, I want my bed back! I'm getting about the same number of hours of sleep but I'm sleeping so much more comfortably without him there. Other than just being persistent with putting him back in his crib to sleep, does anyone have tips/success stories of going from co-sleeping to crib? And would I be doing more harm than good transitioning slowly (because eventually, I'm going to run out of excuses for his crappy sleep)?"

He met the nanny yesterday and hopefully she will come by at least 2x before we leave. I’ll have her practice with a bottle and playing with him for at least an hr or two alone. I had him in a church daycare the other day for the first time and he screamed/hyperventilated for the whole hour. I came in once to calm him down and left again. I’m going to try my best to get husband and nanny to get him used to a bottle in the next couple weeks, and will try again a few times at church to leave him with people. My other concern is naps: he has only nursed to sleep so far and lately has been sucking almost the entirety of both naps (I often lay with him cause he will sleep longer if he can nurse to sleep after he wakes up after 20min) nanny suggested pacifier for naps so don’t have to put him to sleep again but it will just wake him up if I stick it in his mouth.

We put him in a great group called Rainbows that helps kids dealing with a loss or grief or big changes, and it was great for him. He also bonded with another 4 year old there, I’ll call him G. 
Now L is in part-time afternoon daycare, and G happens to be in there, too, but full days. L is very excited, and always wants to play with G. 

Well, for over a week, L has been telling me he hates daycare, doesn’t want to go, he cries, stalls, says he’s sick, etc. I finally coax out of him that G held hands with a different friend at daycare. I have acknowledged his feelings, and talked to him about people having lots of different friends, reminded him of his other friends, comforted him. He is still sad, it’s been over a week now.

I messaged the daycare staff asking them about it and telling them what’s up, and they said he definitely gets sad when G plays with other friends, and that L will often go off by himself and feel sad.

So I am a mum to a 10 week old baby boy. I am practicing attachment parenting (only just found this sub, pretty excited about this community). As a result, we co-sleep, I baby-wear and I breastfeed.

Recently, my son has been going through a few growth spurts and has started comfort sucking quite a lot. While I have no issue with this the majority of the time - (I just sit down and accepts he needs me for a while) it does mean he struggles when I *have* to leave him and I can't give him to another care giver.  For example I have really struggled with constipation since his birth and sometimes I am on the toilet *for a while*. At the moment I take him in his bouncer with me in the bathroom and talk to him. But....the problem is he does get upset (just grizzling not crying) if I take too long. This is where a dummy might make sense, to comfort him.  I have resisted the idea of a dummy so far because I would rather he saw *me* as a source of comfort rather than a plastic inanimate object.

 My justification so far is that 1) I won't use it at night - I am still happy to nurse him to sleep 2) I won't use it when I am able and free to offer my breast instead.

But are dummies ok? Do they align with good attachment parenting? **Am I being selfish by using plastic to comfort my child?**

It's not like a switch will flip and she will stop coming to our bed, she will most definitely cry if we send her back to bed at night. This is something that unfortunately MUST happened 😔 I just want to do it while still making her feel comforted and loved.

We both work and the timing is actually super important for us. Anyway, we told her tonight and she was sad at first, but didn't cry and said she would try to stay in her bed.

I plug an extension cord into the wall, put the monitor on the other end and lay the monitor on top of him, at his feet on top of the blankets. If he so much as rolls over or sits up the motion moves the monitor and makes a noise for me to check. 

Has been such a lifesaver and I'm proud to have thought of it!"
How do you convince your brain that tantrums are ok,AttachmentParenting,16,c85yj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/c85yj8/how_do_you_convince_your_brain_that_tantrums_are/,30,1562078954.0,"My 3yo has been having a tough time lately. He's had a lot of change in his life (new sibling, new daycare, and moving to a new house) so I completely understand why he's having some crazy big emotions and needs to let them out in the form of an explosive tantrum.

The form of his tantrum is very much ""no no no', ""I want this, no the opposite"", ""go away, I want my mommy""and we get stuck in these loops. From what I've read (specifically a lot of Janet Lansbury) the main objective when he's in this is to let him go and not try to do anything to make it better faster. I've tried sitting with him when he yells for me to go and repeating that I love him and I'm here for him. I've tried doing as he asks which ends up being going and coming back and going again etc. He wants to put his pants on, then that's wrong and I'm supposed to do it and then that's wrong. I get that this is normal and I want to do what is right for him, but honestly I'm struggling with that.

With Every cry, scream or request that I can't get right, my inner voice says ""you're failing him, help him feel better, quick, do something"" and I basically have to battle with that until it eventually brings me to tears or yelling both of which are embarrassing. I desperately want to give him what he needs which I think I understand is for me to just be there silently (everything I say or offer or try to distract with seems to make him more upset) while he's losing it with no agenda and just let him be but it is so hard for me to put that into practice.

So I guess my questions are two. 1- how do my fellow APs handle tantrums like this? Do you stay even when they say go? Do you say anything? 2 - if I'm right that the theoretical best way to handle this is to be physically with him not saying anything and just showing that I'm accepting his feelings, how do I convince my brain that it's ok to do this when all of my fight or flight instincts are firing at me telling me to act and my anxiety becomes overwhelming?"
Am I making him sleep poorly?,AttachmentParenting,20,c6k9kn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/c6k9kn/am_i_making_him_sleep_poorly/,22,1561757684.0,"My 14 month old has always been a dependent sleeper. We've held for naps since day 1 and bedshared since 3 months. He nurses to sleep and nurses frequently at night. Going to sleep is fine. I hang out and read until he comes over to the bed. He seems to fall asleep around 7:30 and wakes up around 7:30.

Recently, though, I wonder if I'm making it worse? Last night he was up over 7 times trying to get back on the breast. He also wanted to sleep on top of me, tummy to tummy, breast in his mouth, and head on my chest. He clings to me like a monkey. But then eventually his muscles relax and I roll him next to me so I can go back to sleep, and then he wakes up later. He signs ""milk"" in the middle of the night so I know he wants the breast, even if it's for comfort. 

I'm torn between trying to encourage him to be more independent so he doesn't wake up as frequently, and letting him do what he wants to do. I'm tired but generally have support so I don't *need* to make changes. I'm just worried that he's not sleeping well because he wants to sleep in unsustainable ways, like directly on top of me. He shouldn't be this restless, right? Or is it normal?"

Was only vaguely familiar with AP before birth and have been very grateful for the posts on here. Am hoping you can give me some advice about our nap situation. I'm the first of my friends to have a baby and advice from my family has been more like, ""if you gave her a bottle, she'd sleep longer"" (I exclusively bf) and ""it won't hurt to let her cry"" etc etc :(

At night I feed her then rock her in her sling for 10-15 minutes, then put her down in her co-sleeper joined to my side of the bed. When she wakes in the night she feeds / cuddles back to sleep very easily. 

Day time naps are harder for me. 

At the moment, she is very happy to be pushed to sleep in her pram. 5-10mins of gentle rocking later and she's fast asleep. This is in the bassinet attachment, where she can lay flat. But she is now getting too big for it.

The pram attachment does not allow her to lay flat, it's more of a bucket seat, iyswim. I'm not keen on her napping here as she is not laying flat and her head flops to one side.

I have tried a whole day of using the sling for day naps but found by the end of the day it was really exasperating the pelvic floor issues I've had since the birth :( so am only using this at night as I also use this for daily outings as she is much happier forward facing in this than in pram. 

I feel like I've tried everything to help her nap - laying down next to her and singing / cuddling / feeding only works if she is super exhausted which I'm keen to avoid as 30mins before this she's quite upset. I've tried holding her and walking, holding her and bouncing on exercise ball but the only thing that works for naps is pushing in the bassinet - now too small, or rocking in the sling - am not physically able to do this more than once or twice a day.

Any suggestions so gratefully received. I really don't want to move forward with any ""sleep training"" or ""cry it out"" methods and am just looking for gentle solutions to help her settle."
Toddlers and Lying...? Help!,AttachmentParenting,9,c6eddw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/c6eddw/toddlers_and_lying_help/,9,1561716918.0,"We have a new challenge with our three year old. She’s begun to lie, a lot. At first it seemed harmless and we took it as her exploring her reality and boundaries. But now she’s making up things that are concerning to me. Tonight my husband worked late and by the time he got home she was in her bed but not asleep so he went in to rub her back, night time cuddles, all that. Well about five minutes later they both came to our room and my husband asked me if I hit her? He knew I hadn’t, I think he was just seeing if she would lie about me when confronted with me. She said I had hit her, taken her pacifier, I had cried, and I was frustrated. Okay NONE of that happened. I had put her to bed like normal which for us includes deep breathing, night time stretches, I rub her back, and we cuddle and talk about her day. When I left we had happily planned a trip to my parents house in the morning. So what the heck did she make all that stuff up for?!? What are we supposed to even do???? 

Everything I’ve read regarding children lying written by proponents of attachment or gentle parenting have explained that when kids lie they’re trying to create a certain reality. Like they think if you say something that makes it true. For example I say we’re going to see Grandma and it happens so they say what they want to happen as if it were truth. This doesn’t seem to fit that scenario. I’m just a little freaked out just because this feels so malicious."

Some children simply take longer to fall asleep and I accept this.  She doesn't cry or throw a fit for bedtime which I am thankful for.  However, what does concern me is her continuous repetitive movement during the time it takes her to fall asleep.  As soon as the lights turn off she seems to move her legs constantly, as if she is riding a bike.  Other times she is kicking toward the bottom of the bed.  I stay in the room with her until she falls asleep and try to rub her legs or I will place a pillow at the bottom of her feet to help ease the impact of her kicking.  I am starting to think she might have restless leg syndrome or perhaps a nervous reaction of some sorts.  Does anyone have a similar situation going on?  Or am I jumping to conclusions?

Is My toddler hard to parent or I’m a failure,AttachmentParenting,12,c2qavm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/c2qavm/is_my_toddler_hard_to_parent_or_im_a_failure/,34,1561026552.0,"I’m a stay at home mom to my first and only 2 years and half son, he was extremely a calm baby to the point that I don’t remember him crying for the first 3 months at all ( we fallowed attachment parenting method ). He continued to be an easy baby besides the waking up at night for the feeds for the first year and half ( I was tired and sleep deprived and still to this day) . That changed completely at the age of 18 months and he became difficult to parent. It started with violent tantrums where he will bang his head accompanied with very loud crying. We talked to his paediatrician and he assured us it was normal behaviour and we should ignore it. I found out later through try and error that the tantrums were violent because I was trying to ignore the “bad behaviour “ and as soon as I started hugging him and accepting the tantrums the tenacity reduced but the frequency remained. I can say that I’m not the most patient person and getting triggered by my toddlers limit testing 24/7 wore me down. I avoid activities that force me to set limits like going to museums, story time in my local library or even playgrounds, it’s just too stressful for me to keep repeating the same thing over and over and my wild boy ignores me or keep bossing me around. I know that it’s normal and toddlers favourite word is No. but this is getting to the limit where he is not allowing us to wear sunglasses just because. 
We decided that it’s time to get him introduced to a daycare where he can learn how to operate in a group part time this week ( 2 to 3 half days). The lady who claims that she is a Montessori guru was happy to include him in her small group and we started Monday gradually but she first did not want any of us the parents to stay ( usually daycares in my area, Canada, encourage parents to stay with the kids for a gradual transition), the first day she just kind of snatched my son to the point where he did not even have the time to say goodbye to his father, my son was crying so hard that his dad had to return after 5 minutes and she claimed that it never happened before ( that she failed to contain a new baby from a first separation).Today was the second day of integration , I went and proposed that we will stay for a short period and leave together ( not leaving him behind).
I’m not sure but she was giving him 1000  instructions per second. Did not attempt at any moment to connect with him ( like peekaboo or any other way of connecting with a new kid ). He was able to fallow some but I can understand how overwhelming that 30 minutes was for him, he failed to stay focused and comply by her rigid environment.

She was having 2 other kids in her class and I can tell you that they behaved like they were programmed, they fallowed the rules to the letter. I did not hear them talk at all and they were just sitting in a corner not even playing. 

I’m kind of failing to set limits on a lot of things and I’m conscious it’s bad for him ... but how far should I go ? I’m scared of an ADHD diagnosis wile the silent killer is me. How should I proceed or what should I do to learn and start setting healthy limit ? I don’t want to crash his adventures spirit but at the same time I need to make him learn how to comply with adult rules. 

For our activities it was mostly going to the library ( he likes books ), going for walks or bike rinding in nature or a local Forrest school for parents and toddlers child led play workshops. All of them usually in an open space where kids are welcomed to move and explore on their own. My house is always a mess though."

He has slept in my bed with me since he was 2 days old (he was in the NICU  for the first 48 hours after he was born and he cried the entire time he was in there unless he was being held). He has been an attachment baby since birth. I didn't even actually know what attachment parenting was until he was a few months old but I'm glad I found out about it. I wore him in a stretchy wrap from 2months old until he got too heavy for me (I'm very small so I started having horrible back and hip pain once he got bigger,I don't remember when that was, I think around 8 months), then I switched to a soft structured carried until he was a year. I wore him A LOT and napped with him until a few months ago. Even though I think I have been following attachment parenting for the most part we are struggling in a few areas that I never thought would happen since we bedshare and I still breastfeed/nurse him. 

He can not fall asleep without nursing and wakes up during the night anywhere from 1-5 times per night wanting to nurse back to sleep. I have insomnia so I usually have a very hard time falling back asleep after each waking. And often don't talk back asleep at all. Most nights I'm getting 3-4 hours of sleep..if I'm lucky.

 My son also HATES going to bed. It's a huge power struggle regardless of what time I try getting him to sleep. Usually I try to have him ready for bed by 6:45 and in bed by 7. My husband works a lot and often quite late so he is often not home at bedtime. And he thinks getting our son to sleep is my job because he can't breastfeed our son to sleep. We have a bedtime routine that after supper we get his diaper changed, into his pyjamas, go upstairs, usually read 1-2 books, pray and then nurse/breastfeed to sleep....or at least attempt to nurse to sleep. Usually he will nurse then take off to go play and if I try making him stay in bed he screams and fights me. He often pinches and bites me when he's nursing after I've tried getting him to sleep and he isn't wanting to sleep. I've even tried laying in his crib with him and nursing him in there so he can't take off after he nurses. We have a crib right beside our bed for him that he has only used like a dozen times. When I try getting him to sleep in his crib he nurses then screams wanting to go on the ""big bed"". It takes between 2-4 hours every night to get him to sleep. 

Not to mention naps...I breastfeed him down for his naps and when he wakes up after an hour I have to bf him again to get him back to sleep and he usually comfort nurses the entire second half of his nap. He naps for about 2-2.5 hours. I've tried shortening his nap and it's an absolute nightmare for the rest of the day because he's so tired and it doesn't make bedtime go any easier. 

This quickly became a huge post. I'm so sorry to anyone reading this but I'm getting desperate...what do I do? Oh and I even tried "" gentle sleep training"" him.. Laying him in his crib while I laid on my bed (my husband has to sleep on a mattress on the floor by our bed because our son kicks my husband out of bed because our son usually sleeps diagonal or horizontal on the bed.). Well there was nothing gentle about ""gentle"" sleep training him. He screamed so hard I ended up nursing him to sleep after a couple hours of him crying on and off because it was so awful and didn't work at all! I felt like the worst mom in the world for doing that to him.

 My son is incredibly strong willed (he gets it from his dad for sure.) and I am not. I dont know what to do. We both need more sleep and I so badly need the power struggle at bedtime to end. Part of me wants to have another baby soon but the other part of me doesn't think I can do this again. And there's no way I can handle two kids if one (or both) struggle with sleep. I really hope someone has some advice that will help us. I've tried baths at night, back rubs, lavender essential oil, rocking him to sleep (which is also a sleep crutch of course..), white noise, relaxing classical music. None of it has worked, at least not consistently. I just want to do what's best for my son and my family but I just dont know what to do anymore.

Flash forward 8 months and I finally accepted this was normal and was working for us and stopped listening to CIO experts telling me I had to sleep train. I breastfed on demand and for comfort through the night until I got pregnant again. I night-weaned my daughter and she really only nurses now to sleep at nap time or bed time. She will fall asleep either on her bed on our floor, or in our bed with us. Because we don’t mind and it just feels right to us. 

I’m wondering when do kids usually start to venture away from parents beds? When I was a kid, I actually slept in my parents room until 10 or 11 years old. My sister and I would set up beds at the foot of their bed and sleep there basically every night. I never remember sleeping in their bed with them, but I know that sleeping in their room for so long is definitely counter culture for Americans. I have heard stories that when a new baby comes, they may start to want to sleep in another room. But I also work with kids who have autism, and I can’t say how many parents tell me their kids want to sleep in their room through the age of 11/12. Even my doctor says her 9 year old sleeps in their room! There seems to be such a range, and just wanted to hear stories of families with older children who are maybe more aware it isn’t “normal” to sleep in parents’ room, and what you all have done, if anything."

We tried EVERYTHING (except CIO) from the time he was an infant and nothing seemed to work. Every day of his life, with the exception of maybe a few days, we have spent hours trying to get him to sleep for naps and bedtime. Currently, we have a very set routine when he is at home. We get up and have breakfast, then we try to wear him out as much as possible, outside basically every day the weather permits (even rainy days) and then we have lunch. After lunch we go into a very dim room with some gentle music and lie down in bed. He will sometimes drift off after 30 minutes or so, but usually he just never stops moving unless we physically hold him still, or he tries to get into EVERYTHING he can in the room. It often takes an hour or more to get him to sleep. Even when there is nothing to get into he will just play with the blankets and sheets. At bedtime we go for a long walk with the stroller, then do bath time and jammies, then turn the lights off and all lie down together in bed (we bedshare). At bedtime he still nurses and this used to get him to sleep after 45-60 minutes, but within the last few months he has started popping right up after nursing and going through the same motions of getting into everything. My husband usually has to put him in the carrier and walk for an hour or more to get him to sleep, and then there are nights when nothing works and after 3-4 hours our son just falls asleep from exhaustion. I want to stop nursing so we will be ending that soon, just FYI. This routine is making us all miserable.

We expected him to struggle at daycare, but learned that he has no issues at all when napping there. In fact, we’ve been told repeatedly that he is the best napper in his room! His teacher said that when naptime rolls around, our son will go to his cot and put himself to sleep. Only sometimes does he need a back pat to help him get to sleep. I asked about their routine and it is almost the same as ours! Breakfast followed by indoor and outdoor play, lunch, then lights off and peaceful music. They sleep in the same room they play and eat in, so my son is surrounded by toys and chairs and things but apparently does not try to get into things at naptime. The only major difference is that they sleep on little cots, and obviously we are not there. Plus, he is surrounded by seven other tots all going to sleep, too. So, clearly he can easily nap.

What are we doing wrong? How can we fix this? We are so tired, literally and figuratively, of this scenario. Please help!"
Daycare transition issues,AttachmentParenting,5,bxse1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/bxse1c/daycare_transition_issues/,12,1559927395.0,"So another daycare question - our transition isn't really going that great and I need any advice I can get.

I've been trying to transition my 14 month old to daycare for the past month and we are both having a really hard time with it. 

We started off going to the daycare just for the mornings to get used to the routines etc. Then we started staying all day and napping there as well. My daughter is usually the last one to fall asleep and the first to wake up, usually because of some unfamiliar sound. This week I have started leaving the room for periods of time and my daughter really hates it. 

Now when we get to the daycare she starts to grip me and will not let go on her own. She rarely ventures far from me and when she does and cannot immediately see me she starts to cry. When I have left and come back she is usually still crying or has started crying again to the point of shaking. 

I've talked to the daycare workers and it seems they are able to distract her for short periods of time but once she realizes I'm not there again she starts crying again. 

She has also started to become agitated at home when I'm not in the same space as her. Before this she was content with me leaving the room but this week she is very unsettled by this. 

Is this all normal? Is it just part of the transition? Any tips for how to move forward next week with our daycare transition?"

Quick background: FTM to a 3.5mo girl and we EBF.

I was reading about potty training and there seems to be a kind of AP potty training that's done between birth and 12 months old. (There's a page on Kellymom that talks about IPT.) It's something about reading cues but I don't quite understand it and the page didn't go into detail about it.

Was wondering if anyone has tried it? Could you talk about how to go about it? How does it work and if you were successful?

For those of you that don't potty train this way, how did you potty train? And if you haven't started, what's your approach for when you start potty training?

Also, is there a how NOT to potty train? Would love to know!

I've only just started looking into this topic so I know close to nothing about it! Please share your experiences. Thanks!! 🐻

ETA: Seems like Kellymom says there are two books on it but I was hoping to get some info before I buy the books and read the whole lot of it and not commit to it, lol. Has anyone read the books??"

As in, bed sharing, baby wearing, nursing until my supply dried up,  etc. Everywhere we go, people comment on how sweet and gentle our son is, how empathetic he is, and how he has the kindest soul. Yesterday at his check up with the doctor, they said he’s ahead by several months on all his milestones, and they said it’s clear his attachment to us is extremely strong because he felt comfortable exploring the room and the whole office while checking in with us.

Buuuuut of course, as soon as I mention that we bedshare and that he naps in his Ergo, or that until recently he nursed to sleep, they’re so damn critical. Family members have told us that because we aren’t sleep training him, he’s spoiled. Yesterday the doctor told us that he needs to learn coping methods. I’m sorry, but I just don’t feel like an infant needs to learn to comfort themselves with no support when they’re distressed. I’m 27 years old and I still need a hug when I’m crying! 

I just don’t get it. Everyone is amazed by our son but then they bash the methods that I truly feel have made the difference for him. I’m so tired of telling people we cosleep and having them react with a shocked look, or tutting at us when we respond to a temper tantrum with love and support."

I have a 19 month old son. He has always been a high needs baby/toddler. He had colic as a newborn and just would not stop crying. He always hated the stroller so I had to babywear him. He won't sit in a freaking high chair, he will just climb right out. Won't sit in a shopping cart, will climb out, so I have to wear him in the store. He throws fits over getting his diaper or clothes changed. Tantrums allllll day long. I try to let him walk down the sidewalk with me but he will just stop and pick up trash or reverse course or run into the road and if I try to stop him, total meltdown. Going to the park is fun, until it's time to leave, and then total meltdown. He has always hated the carseat and screams for even short drives so if I'm not driving, I sit in the back with him. 

All this to say, I've done my best with him. I cosleep with him in a twin bed in his room. It started out as survival mode and now he is used to it. I don't mind sleeping with him. I am trying my best to respond to his needs, he seems to be a very sensitive kid with big feelings. I was like him as a kid and my parents let me cry it out or whatever and it still hurts me to this day.

Putting my son to bed isn't too bad. He is weaned now so I just lay in bed with him while he flops around for about 30 min and then he falls asleep and generally sleeps all night. He doesn't need much, if anything, from me, but sometimes wakes for a quick cuddle. I want to try to put his bed on the floor soon and try to leave him there alone overnight.

We have another baby on the way, due in August. I asked my husband last night which kid he would like to put to bed when we have 2 and he said I will do both. Btw we both work full time, I'm not a SAHM. I was like, uh no. But my husband insisted that our son should be putting himself to bed and not need us, and that if I want to ""coddle"" him, that's fine, but my husband will not deal with the consequences. I said, well you can put the baby to bed then. My husband responded that the baby will need to nurse to sleep and that I should not ""hurt"" the baby so that I can continue to ""coddle"" our son.

I'm not sure at what age my husband thinks babies go from appropriately nursing to sleep to suddenly putting themselves to bed with no assistance. My husband said that we need to ""teach"" or son to sleep by himself and put himself to bed and and although he will not understand it and will cry. I insisted that crying is not necessary, and that we can work on transitioning our son to sleeping alone. But I still think many 1 year olds appropriately need someone to put them to bed at night. No?? 

Idk I'm just so hurt and disappointed. I'm not going to be able to put 2 babies to bed at night, nor should I have to. I hate feeling like I'm being told that it's my fault that things are this way. They're freaking babies."

Recently, he’s been taking early meetings and has been attending a night networking event once a week. He also had a 3 day business trip last week. So, DD’s time with DH has decreased a bit. 

DD who is usually a big mama’s girl has wanted nothing to do with me since DH’s business trip. She falls and gets hurt and says “da da! Da da!” “Daddy’s at work, mommy can hug you!” But then she asks to either call Grammy or call [uncle], and when that doesn’t work, she goes to her beloved baby doll for comfort. Doesn’t want me anywhere near her. We went to the zoo with another SAHM and her 2 year old, and DD wanted that mom to hold her. She asked me to put her down several times only to go to that mom and ask to be held. She wanted that mom to hold her hand and go pet the goats, not me. 

Now, I want to say that this is all a phase. I am not taking any of it personally, and I am actually excited that she is branching out and going to other people (she’s so shy that she won’t even let 3/4 of her grandparents hold her). 

One promising detail is that she got *legitimately* hurt yesterday and she went to her daddy first but then asked for me and went to me.

I was hoping someone here might have an idea for how to accommodate some sort of separate bed for our 2 year old (a little over 2.5 years old) in our own bedroom.

We have always co slept because that was the only way we could get sleep. But now she is sleeping so much better and we’d like to introduce her to having her own bed (plus she’s asked for one!).  For various reasons we are living in a one bedroom condo and will be for one more year. The one bedroom thing was never an issue before but now we are stuck for how to get her set up with her own bed. 

We ideally want somewhere for her to sleep the first half of the night, with the understanding she can always come into our bed if (when!) she wakes half way through the night.

I’m so ready to get our mattress back up off the floor and onto a frame, so I had the idea of getting a single/twin trundle to slide underneath. But apparently that doesn’t work with a king due to needing central posts to support the frame. 

We really need something that can be packed away somehow due to needing to access closets and things in the daytime. The bedroom is not big enough to have another bed permanently out. I considered just putting a crib mattress down and standing it up inside the closet in the day, but it just won’t be big enough. She still likes us to lie down with her to go to sleep and we are happy to do it. Plus she is used to rolling around a big king bed. 

Any ideas of something that can be a safe, comfortable bed at night but then be put away somehow in the day?

Thank you :)"

I know this isn't strictly attachment parenting related, but a lot of you also follow RIE which might be more the category this falls into.

My very strong willed 2.5 Yr old has epic meltdowns that she just can't calm down from. She does not want me to touch her, and if i try to hold her, she thrashes and screams a blood curdling scream.

I know a very common parenting technique is to hold them tight anyway, effectively restraining them, until they calm down.

Somehow it just feels wrong, taking away their bodily autonomy and disrespecting their very clear no signals. On the other hand, is it one of those cases where the parents know best and just have to do it anyway?

Thoughts?

If I leave her (staying nearby) she does eventually come to me, but not before hitting her own face and pulling her hair etc). I tried holding her last night and she hated it, but I think she might have calmed down a little quicker. Then once she was calm I said I know you don't like it, but mummy is holding you to protect you and help you calm down. She snuggled in but said ""but not too tight mummy""."

Edit more info our goal is to get our son sleeping on his own without lots of assistance. (Is this even an attainable goal? Do most two year olds need frequent help at night?) Ideally without either of us. 
We are moving in the future so we want to avoid putting him in his own room before the move but maybe that's our only option but it wouldn't be worth it if one of us needs to attend to him frequently at night.

Currently for day time naps he will only drop off if he’s either in the sling or being breastfed to sleep. I can’t transfer him to his cot as he wakes up as soon as I start lowering him in. Sometimes if I’m lucky I can get him in the sleepyhead if I put it next to me on the sofa. However I then have to stay there as I’m worried about him rolling off. He usually sleeps there for an hour. If he wont go onto the sleepyhead, I have to lie next to him on the sofa until he wakes usually two hours later.

Evenings and nights are even worse. I can’t get him in the cot in the other room as he wakes immediately so he either lies next to me on the sofa or I spend my whole evening trying to get him on the sleepyhead where he only sleeps for 20 minutes at a time. My husband and I have to have the tv volume down so low we can barely hear it and whisper to each other so as not to wake him up.

She’s always been pretty compliant though sometimes unhappy about it (bedtime routine especially for example). At the end of the day (metaphorically) I make a lot of effort to reconnect with her but ultimately Im not great at it all and our relationship is not that healthy. And now I’m getting some intense kickback- shouting no and I hate you you’re stupid, running away...It’s awful. I try to stay close while respecting her ask for space. But also wondering if this is a major call for connection... or what? Please advise, thanks 🙏"

How to help toddler while nursing newborn,AttachmentParenting,20,bkn9mj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/bkn9mj/how_to_help_toddler_while_nursing_newborn/,7,1557018294.0,"2.5 Yr old is adjusting to the new baby as expected. More meltdowns, wants to be held by whoever is holding the baby, showering her in kisses one minute and giving her a sneaky whack the next.

However she has two big hang ups. When she's tired or upset, she will not come near me while I have the baby. She won't let me comfort her, or help diffuse her tantrum before she becomes a choking out of control mess. She won't lie down and go to sleep (for hours. Literally hours one night when I was alone and the baby wouldn't be put down).

The other, and this is mostly where I need advice, is that she hates it when I'm feeding the baby. She'll come and grab her, pull her, hit her, be very aggressive with her. And/or she will throw herself on the ground and scream and cry that the baby isn't allowed to be with me, until I'm finished and can hand the baby off. I can kind of see that she obviously recognises this is a very intimate situation, and is very jealous of the baby having that. (I weaned her a year ago, I don't think she remembers it well enough for that to be the issue). It breaks my heart to see her so stressed out and upset. It also stresses the baby out and she can't eat.

I don't want to walk away from toddler when she clearly desperately needs me, plus who knows what she'd get up to, but this isn't sustainable either.

I've tried suggesting we read books while I nurse, that she cuddles while I nurse, I let her put her hands right on my boobs while I nurse, be close tome, I've suggested she nurse her doll, I've offered distractions... Nothing works. For the first couple of weeks she was happy to be super close to me while I was nursing, but now we have this.

What do I do??!"

Naps have always been an issue for her, she napped on me exclusively until she was 14 months. Now she goes down for her nap with a bit of snuggling which is fine. Our issue is that for the last 2 months she has been waking up in the middle of her nap screaming and needs someone to cuddle her for the remainder of the nap, which can be anywhere from 30min to 1.5 hours. She had been getting her canines so I figured that might be the problem but they don’t seem to be bothering her at night and since the baby was born her naps have gotten shorter and the screaming has gotten more intense. Currently I’m recovering from a c-section but once I’m on my own with two babies I can’t really afford to spend an hour as a human mattress for her. Does anyone have experience with this or an idea that might help us to encourage her to nap as long as she needs to on her own?"

Falling asleep on his own,AttachmentParenting,13,bh74ot,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/bh74ot/falling_asleep_on_his_own/,10,1556217936.0,"Hi all,

We are struggling with getting out 2.5 year old falling asleep every evening and it takes around 1.5 hours. His dad or I lie down next to him and wait until he falls asleep. Anyway, the parent who puts him to bed falls asleep before the child does, and then gets up late, sleepy and ends up not having any time for oneself in the evenings. 
This is frustrating and we would like to introduce new way of falling asleep, that is we would like our son to learn fall asleep on his own. Btw we co-sleep. 

We have more or less fixed schedule for the day and our evening routing is: brushing teeth, pyjamas, reading a book in the bed, and counting and saying night-night to fingers and toes 😊 It takes 1.5. hours since we start reading a book till he falls asleep. 

Our 2.5 year old talks for some time, then moves around in the bed and it takes time for him to settle down, find a comfortable position and fall asleep. Ideally, we would read a book, say night-night and then leave so he can fall asleep on his own. I also believe that the mere presence of the parent provides some extra stimulation, because there is someone to talk to, and this is one of the reason why it takes longer time for him to wind down and fall asleep.  

Any experiences with teaching a child falling asleep on his own? Any suggestions are very welcome!"

We have tried taking away privileges like TV and milk and she gets upset for a minute, but ultimately decides she would rather stay awake than get it back.

Ummmmmmmm? Anyone experience this? 

Also I did explain to her about how friggin long it takes alcohol to leave BM and that even if I pumped he would be upset that im not there... Plus encouragement often leads to clogged ducts in my case. Again she says"" he would be fine if you didn't spoil him, he can just cry I don't mind""

Edit: thank you, thank you for all the advice, this is the most cathartic exchange I have had in the 32 year attempt to deal with her. Your insights have helped me realize that there is no point in trying to be ""nice"" she will be upset no matter what because I am a person she is trying to control. 
Thank you for the various perspectives as well! So much easier to say no and stand my ground when I can remind myself that I am not responsible for her happiness and that I have a obligation to myself and my son to keep her toxicity as far away and in check. 

I really appreciate the suggestion of groups of people who are in the same situation as me, for the sake of trying to heal if there are any other groups or things I can do (I am in therapy) I am happy to look into it.

I’m very happy nursing and lying with him if it takes less time but it seems like it’s not working anymore. Maybe it’s just a shift in schedule maybe he’s ready to not nurse to sleep?

"I messed up, help!",AttachmentParenting,25,bbhs1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/bbhs1i/i_messed_up_help/,19,1554898964.0,"I have a baby girl, and when she was 6.5 months we started doing a gentle form of sleep training. The reason for this is that she woke every 40 minutes to hour from 7pm to 7am, and I am alone with her six nights and five days a week - completely. The sleep deprivation was leading to dangerous situations, and it was making my PPA worse. We tried bedsharing out of desperation, but my PPA is fixated on suffocation/SIDS, so while she started to sleep for 1.5 to 2 hours, I was waking up every twenty minutes - heart racing, checking her breathing, then unable to fall asleep due to fear. 

We hired a sleep consultant, she came up with a ‘gentle’ plan (the ‘shuffle’ method) because we are attachment style parents and even doing sleep training in the first place made me uncomfortable. The program had us doing daily logs for sleep/activity/feeds, we studied her routine and tried to help her get to the right amount of daytime sleep hours, developmentally appropriate awake windows, everything we could to set us up for success. The first 3 nights you’re supposed to be right beside the crib, patting and shhing, picking up if needed, but baby being put in the crib 100% awake. The next three nights you’re supposed to just verbally support from the middle of the room, and the last three nights you’re supposed to verbally support from the door.

We made it to night 9 and I broke down. Nights 1 & 2 were absolutely wretched, she did okay I think on night 3, night 4 went really well, nights 5&6 were tough, night 7 was great, night 8 was awful. It was a MESS. Way more tears and crying than I felt comfortable with, for way longer than I was comfortable with. The trainer kept pushing for me to stop rushing in during middle of the night wake ups (we roomshare, but she was referring to the first few hours when I would be downstairs) - she wanted me to wait 10 minutes before responding. I did it one or two nights (I don’t even remember, everything is so muddled in my brain) and I am beating myself up for it now! 

She cried so hard, I will never forget the sound, I will never forgive myself. I decided to say screw this program because it is NOT working for us, and while the consultant SAID this was not ‘CIO’ - it started to become it when she was pushing the 10 minute thing. I hate myself for going against my instincts and trying it. 

How badly did I harm my daughter? How can I fix this for her? I am completely obsessing over this terrible stretch of crying, and I am petrified of the damage we have done. My PPA is flaring up terribly, and I just want to fix this for her.

I’m responding to every cry as soon as I can now (sometimes if I’m in deep sleep it takes me a few minutes to wake up), and trying so hard to make it up to her. Can you guys tell me what to look out for with regards to how this could have damaged her - or give me any advice to fix things? 

Thank you."

We do not have the living arrangements to put her in her own room currently. 


She never used to be like this but for awhile now bedtime is always a fight that takes an hour or two after lights out. We have the same bedtime routine we have had for ages, dinner, bath, teeth, nappy, stories then lights out. It started before the new baby and they weirdly sleep through each other’s cries and almost never wake each other up, so I don’t think it’s the baby. 

We’ve tried dropping her nap but then she is a meltdown monster from about lunchtime onwards, so I feel like she still needs the nap. At night she’s tired and yawning, but will fight it with every fiber of her being. I’ve tried to explain how good and important sleep is (explaining things is part of our parenting style, and often works well with her) but on this she’s just not listening. 

I am beyond exhausted and feel like a complete failure as a mother that I can’t get my child the basic sleep she needs. She’s tired all the time but fights her day naps too, often until it’s late in the day, then bedtime is even worse.

Do I just need to drop the nap and wait for her to level out? Does it work like that? 

We’ve done so well with attachment parenting, it usually works so well, but I can’t figure out the sleep thing. I feel like I’m missing something and it’s making me feel like a failure.

Sleeping and Anxiety,AttachmentParenting,2,bap0p2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/bap0p2/sleeping_and_anxiety/,3,1554724067.0,"Let me start by saying that I am so glad to find this subreddit!!!

I have a son (13) and my daughter who is 10.  This post is specifically about my daughter.  My son officially stopped co-sleeping just last year but it was really around age 6.  I think the bed just got too crowded for him lol.  He slept in his room one night and after that it was only occasionally if my husband was away on business.  He is quiet and a people pleaser so not sure if that’s why he stopped so easily or not.  Both of my kids deal with anxiety.  While my son is very quiet my daughter definitely has more fire lol.  You would think she would be very independent but she’s not.  She hates going to school or sleeping alone because she misses me and is often afraid of me dying.  She has co-slept since birth.  I am fine with it but when she was about 8 the bed got too crowded for my husband who moved into her room.  Obviously not ideal from his point of view but he was supportive still.  

The issue started this weekend.  My husband has been very busy traveling and I think we both kind of had our guard down.  We have 4 cats and a bird and although my daughter has always bugged for her own pet it has always been a firm no.  Again, dh is not a huge fan of the amount of pets so I’ve respected that.  We are very happily married but of course the pets and co-sleeping can cause some tension.  Anyways, my daughter started asking for a hamster again and to our surprise my husband actually said sure as long as she was sleeping in her room with it because he did not want to sleep with the hamster.  Fair enough.  Now in hindsight obv we should have made her sleep on her own first but she was very insistent that she wanted it and she didn’t need to sleep with me anymore (she’s very capable of it she just likes snuggling and who can blame her).  So we agreed and she was so excited and no issues at all...the first night.  Second night I slept in with her to help her adjust.  Tonight she’s on her own again (but she knows she can come get me if needed) and tomorrow dh is on a trip again so we will have a sleepover.  Tonight was very rough.  She was very upset and said she loves her hamster but also wishes things were back to ‘normal’, meaning sleeping with me :(

Anyways, my husband is important and my daughter is important.  He is very patient and supportive but I also worry he may have his limits at some point.

Any advice on how best to handle this situation and respect both of their needs?  Whether she got her hamster or not the issue of my husband sleeping in her room would still be there.  I’ve had nobody to talk to so glad that I found this group!"

Balancing gentle parenting with OFSTED approved school!,AttachmentParenting,12,b3bb98,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/b3bb98/balancing_gentle_parenting_with_ofsted_approved/,16,1553113158.0,"Hello, I'm new to Reddit. Got the account to look for some advice... Hopefully this is the right subreddit to be writing on, if not, being pointed in the right direction would be appreciated. :)

My 5 year is partly home schooled but also attends a setting 3 days a week. It's an alternative independent kindergarten (3-8), sort of forest school, following some Steiner/ Montessori principals. The school is Ofsted approved but it's ethos states ""Children are not measured against each other but against their own potential"".

Her teacher has expressed at parents evenings that my daughter is 'behind' in managing her emotions, however said this isn't affecting her learning as she's doing well in all other aspects.

Then her teacher asked if she could get in a play therapist to work with my daughter. I thought about and decided this wasn't necessary as I feel she is making a lot of progress with learning about her emotions and I feel given more time to develop at her own pace, it will no longer be an issue at school.

6 months later the teacher has said there's no improvement and asked if the head of SENCo (special education needs coordinator) can be brought in to assess my daughter. I found myself agreeing as it felt quite intimidating with two teaching professionals, telling me this was needed, a second time. I questioned if I was being blinkered to the severity of this 'problem' my daughter is supposedly experiencing at school.
I asked for examples of the behaviour that's concerning them. They gave the example of my daughter crying when she can't sit next to a teacher at lunch or when she makes a mistake on a drawing. We experience this at home occasionally but have never felt it's unusual for a 5 year old, after talking her through her feelings we find she settles down very quickly and is able to look for solutions. We experience no behaviour at home that is extreme or unmanageable, and have never had any cause to believe she needs additional support/ help from a professional.

Her teacher says it makes her sad when my daughter gets sad. I sometimes feel like perhaps it's possible that other children in the class may be experiencing sadness, fear, anxiety, but have perhaps learnt to repress/ stifle these feelings. I don't want my daughter to end up doing this as I feel it will bring problems in later life. I feel regulating emotions and repressing emotions are a fine line and I'm careful at home that she's never been shamed into repressing emotions, or become anxious of annoying or upsetting others.

In the last month, she has started to come home from school and after being asked how her day was, always responds telling us how often she got upset. For example last night she said ""I had one wimp today"". This is language she has never heard from us. We have been responding by telling her we aren't asking how much she's cried, it's ok to cry, we want to know what she loved about her day, what activities she did, etc. Although we do also give her space to talk about any moments that made her sad and think of ways to deal with these feelings next time. However we don't want this to be blown out of proportion and become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Basically... I feel my daughter, if 'behind' in managing her emotions, by mainstream standards, she will catch up naturally in her own time. I don't want her to feel she is different or worry what others think and so repress her emotions. I don't want her to be labelled with a problem that I don't think exists. I want her to be seen as the magical individual she is, as all children are. But I worry I'm being a crazy parent and I don't know how to feel confident in myself when communicating with the school."

We could leave after she fell asleep and sometimes she slept through her normal schedule but usually she woke up and cried for us. This is totally uncharted territory to us because we coslept from birth until she moved into her room and that was a smooth transition. So we never dealt with her waking and crying until this past weekend. We went to her whenever she cried - again we felt this was the only compassionate reaction. 

By Tuesday afternoon, she was able to go down for nap independently. Tuesday night she needed Daddy to stay until she fell asleep, but she slept through the night with no issues. Wednesday nap was normal, and then Wednesday night she was ok with her usual bedtime routine including falling asleep independently, and she slept through. I was hopeful we were out of the woods. 

Today was her first day back a daycare (usually she goes Monday through Thursday) and she didn't nap there. This is typical for the first daycare day of the week, but usually after a skipped nap she goes to bed early and easy. Not today. She insisted that I stay until she fell asleep, which took longer than usual because I was there. She has woken and cried for me already twice in 3.5 hours. 

In a way I wish I could just stay in bed with her, but I have a 3 month old who needs me to cosleep and night nurse. Plus I believe my daughter gets better, more restful sleep when she is alone in her own bed. 

What do you think? Is this difficult night just a hiccup in our way back to normal, like if we stay the course and keep attempting her normal routine, and responding with compassion when she struggles, will we get back to independent sleep soon? Or are we setting ourselves back by allowing the routine to bend and accommodating her new requests for company in bed? Should we create some new routine to get off this track we're on? What should we do?"
Baby won’t sleep unless I’m next to her. Bed sharing advice needed.,AttachmentParenting,19,azyskd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/azyskd/baby_wont_sleep_unless_im_next_to_her_bed_sharing/,25,1552367215.0,"My daughter is 6 months old. Up until last month I rocked and nursed her to sleep and placed her in a bassinet next to my bed. Sometimes I’d have to rock her an extra time or two if she woke up grumbly or fussy within 30-60 mins of being put down. This was totally manageable. 

She recently started having separation anxiety and would wake up wailing in the bassinet. I started laying with her in my bed (we moved mattress to floor for safety) and nursing to sleep. I’d slip out after 20 mins and then return to bed when it was time for me to sleep. This was great. But then....somehow the separation anxiety got worse. And now she wakes up sobbing and wailing within 3 mins of me slipping out and I will have to come back. She is dead asleep when I slip out. Last night this cycle (nurse to sleep, slip out, loud sobbing, she stops crying as soon I have entered the room, fully settles as soon I lay down, falls asleep, I slip out....etc) happened for two hours. This is no longer working. 

I want to bed share. I don’t want to do CIO. We have excellent quality of sleep after I come to bed for the night. I would just like some down time in the evening to get things done or relax. Does anyone have any ideas on how to get her to either stay asleep when put down or be okay if she momentarily wakes and I’m not there? Please help me! I can’t keep going to bed at 8pm 😭"

My (just) five month old daughter it completely, 100%, unsoothable. She’s been like this since she was a month old. The days consist of a constant steady level of the fussies, and the nights are an all out battle. 

I often feel like a failure because nothing I can do will make things better. She doesn’t comfort nurse, she won’t take a pacifier, rocking makes her seriously angry, she hates being in her LennyLamb carrier, cuddling, bouncing, shushing, distracting- nada. 

While the days are hard, I’m mostly desperate for a cure to our terrible evenings. I’ve tried both nap/bedtime schedules and letting her decide when she’s tired. Neither seem to work. The only way I can get her to sleep is by making sure she’s INCREDIBLY hungry and INCREDIBLY tired, so that nursing lasts long enough that she falls asleep before she’s full. If I can’t get her to sleep by nursing (50% success rate) I will spend an average of 2-4 hours rocking, walking, and shushing- until she wears herself out. She will fuss the entire time, but I won’t allow her to all-out scream herself to sleep. 

Both methods still result in her waking nearly every hour through the night. 

I need some serious advice as I’m at my wits end. I’ve never met a baby as inconsolable as she is. I want so badly to stick to attachment parenting. We cosleep and EBF. It hurts my heart enough the nights when I hold her and she screams herself to sleep, so I really don’t want to CIO, but everyone I vent to tells me it’s my own fault for “spoiling her” and I just need to let her scream.

Attachment style of play and school-like learning at a toddler age? What is the balance?,AttachmentParenting,9,awc68p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/awc68p/attachment_style_of_play_and_schoollike_learning/,14,1551518088.0,"I have a lovely friend who does attachment parenting (she introduced me to the amazing book *Unconditional Parenting* by Alphie Kohn)

She is a wonderful mother, I need to state that first. Her child is about 3.

She lets her child explore the world, play, spends quality time, reads her books, however....she doesn't focus/force on teaching her daughter things. (Examples: numbers, practicing with flashcards, etc.)

She firmly believes that at this young age it is too early to start with all the ""drilling to learn things."" Like, not make it feel like school. 

Is this attachment parenting? Should I be doing this?

I don't want my almost 2 year old to miss out on joys in life by forcing him to learn things that he will learn at school.  

What are your thoughts on this? 

What effects might it have on toddlers to be forced every day to learn ""school things""? Because I know some parents think it is a competition and compare their child to others and I don't want that for my little guy.

I want him to feel accepted as he is.

I'm sorry if this post isn't making sense, but I do hope *some* of it did and would appreciate ANY responses related to the topic. "

I feel like all I read about or hear about is parents asking for advice on how to spend less time with or be further away from their children. I just never liked being away from my daughter. It gives me an almost physical uneasiness. She’s a little over 3 now and we’ve never spent a night apart. The thought of her sleeping in her own room not hearing her breathe makes my chest really heavy (she sleeps in her own bed but it’s right next to mine). If she wants to be carried I pick her up, I don’t feel the need to “teach” her to always walk by herself. I know she can do it. If she’s cranky at the dinner table and wants to sit in my lap I’ll let her because it calms her down and I hate seeing her express needs that are not being listened to. If she wakes up at night and want lo lay next to me I let her. If someone offered me a weekend trip away from her I wouldn’t enjoy it. She’s at daycare but it took me a lot to be ok with it and not feeling bad when dropping her off. At first when she started I had some weird anxiety symptoms like shaky hands just from being away from her not knowing if she was ok. It’s not that I don’t value some alone time, I do! But only when I’m 100% sure she’s ok. And it’s not that we have fun all the time when we’re together, she’s 3 so of course there’s a lot of tantrums and boundaries testing. It’s just that my instinct to be close to her is so clear, I would have to violate myself to be away from her just because I “should”. Still I find myself apologizing for all of the above things I do for her like they’re wrong, that kids need to be taught independence (even if I know that’s not true) and parents should focus more on their own needs.

Difficult almost 3yr old,AttachmentParenting,5,av8swr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/av8swr/difficult_almost_3yr_old/,10,1551268336.0,"Not 3 yet, but 3 in May.

Love him to bits but he's hard work. Especially for my wife who is at home with him all day. We are already living in a stressful situation with my parents while we build our new home. So I suspect this plays a part, that said, he is just very difficult to entertain. At the moment it feels like a battle for my wife until his bedtime (which is pretty late as it is, he won't even think about falling asleep until 9pm).

He doesn't enjoy arty crafty stuff. Doesn't like to sing or dance (though he used to like dancing). He seems to get bored of his toys super quick, so he'll just end up playing with every toy for 5min and moving on. Doesn't seem to like having fun in the large backyard (lots of trees, shrubs, etc...). Seems disinterested in educational activities like learning letters and numbers (he knows how to count to 10 almost, but he wouldn't know what the numbers look like). He is impossible to get to relax and has *unlimited* energy - so all day long things are on the go. He won't take a nap unless it's in the car, so my wife doesn't get a break hardly ever.

We do want to get rid of a lot of his toys as they just don't seem to do anything for him, even though we tried to stick with ""open ended"" toys he doesn't seem to have the imagination yet to bring those toys to life. We can help of course, but there's only so much time we can ""lead"" the play and not become bored ourselves.

So what what does he like? He seems to like going out on adventures. Walking and exploring *new* places. He loves throwing stuff (ugh!). He loves to climb. We talked about a building an open ended climbing frame of some sort, like Steiner schools often have, but it's fairly pointless to do that now as we will hopefully be moving in a few months. My wife takes him out when she can, but we don't have the funds, or frankly the places, to spend every day out and about.

On top of that he's basically refusing to potty train and is way too big for his cloth nappies now, so we may need to switch to disposables. We don't want to push this and create anxiety around toilet time, but at the same time it's a lot of work. He hates nappy changes and of course there is all the washing.

Oh and he's extremely difficult at dinner time. Most nights he'll refuse to eat, until he decides he does want to eat, but then he'll only eat a bit and we have to then sit with him and shovel food in his mouth (in a nice way of course, but this is something we didn't want to do and haven't done in the past). If he goes without a good meal at dinner he gets hungry at night and is very tossy and turny (co-sleeping).

Just feel like we are stuck in a miserable rut where no-one is particularly happy. Don't get me wrong, I love having him around (him and his mother went away for a week and I missed them dearly) but we need a more positive atmosphere. A better flow and routine. Any ideas? Is this normal?"

Have I ruined my baby's attachment style?,AttachmentParenting,17,au6ts5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/au6ts5/have_i_ruined_my_babys_attachment_style/,10,1551033406.0,"My baby is 7 months old and I'm worried that I'm not giving her enough affection. I'm a child abuse survivor so physical touch and  intimacy are very difficult for me to display. I'm afraid I am not making enough eye contact or I'm not talking to her enough. Before giving birth I thought the main problem could have been that that phones are distracting, I've read about how ""brexting"" is detrimental for the mom-child bond and I made it a goal to never use the phone while breastfeeding and playing with her, and only use it to take the occasional picture of her. But then I realized that instead of looking at her while breastfeeding, I'm still spacing out and staring at the ceiling, and I wish I could just focus on her face, but sometimes I can't. She sometimes makes eye contact very briefly while nursing and she smiles at me while playing, but most of the time she just ignores me and does her own thing, either playing with toys or staring at the boob / nursing necklace. Is this normal exploration for a 7 months old? Could this be a sign of an avoidant attachment? Or is it just secure? She does look for me when she gets bored of playing or nursing and she does look at me in the eye. I just wonder if it's enough. I grew up thinking I don't deserve affection and I need to constantly remind myself to give it to others, it doesn't come naturally and I'm afraid this could influence her. Since she was born, she would get startled and stop breastfeeding when I talked, singed lullabies and caressed her hands or back, and I figured ""maybe she is very sensitive and doesn't like that"" so I tried to let her nurse in peace, and let her decide when to grab my hands and search for me. But now I'm not sure it was the right choice... On one hand I don't want to force her to be touched when it's clearly so upsetting to her, but on the other hand I wonder if I should have gotten her used to physical affection earlier? What do I do? Am I still in time to help her have a secure attachment? "

I’m going back to work in 2 weeks, and she’s going to daycare 4 days a week, at a centre (4:1 teacher ratio) who I have expressly advised she is not to be left to cry without being comforted, I trust that they will do this, they’ve been on board with her not sleeping in a cot, are ok for her to nap in a bouncer or on a mat on the floor and we’ve spent 4 consecutive days there playing, I’ve observed the staff and their interactions and I am comfortable they are nurturing and attentive (as much as possible when looking after 4 babies at a time). 

But she’s never been away from me for more than a few hours and that was with her dad who she is strongly bonded to, a month ago we left her with my parents for 2 hours, that’s it. I’ve always been there, always able to attend to her needs, she’s barely ever cried unless she’s fallen down or ill. 

At the play dates at the centre, she’s generally been happy except she gets overwhelmed/scared very easily and has cried, to be honest, this week she’s probably cried more than she has in total, since she was a newborn. 

I just keep having this image of her getting scared & upset, looking for me to comfort her and I’m not there. She doesn’t calm down on her own, I know this because she also spent the majority of her life hating the car and screams on a car trip, doesn’t ever tire herself out, just gets more and more hysterical to the point she is coughing/choking and if she gets to that point in care and I can’t be there to fix it, I just don’t think she’ll be able to calm down and I’m so worried about how traumatic this might be for her. 

Everyone says they settle in, it might be a rough few weeks but they get there. Isn’t that just like sleep training, which we know causes lasting emotional damage. I just can’t shake the thought of my sweet little girl being so upset and looking for me... please tell me you’ve had kids with similar personalities and they’ve been ok??

I have a 4 week old baby and my oldest will be 3 in May.

All in all my oldest has handled the new arrival really well, but where I struggle is having the bandwidth to coach him through his behavioral challenges. For example, he will push away from the dinner table and leave halfway through a meal. Or today he was running around the house throwing things on the floor and throwing things at me and the baby. I know this is attention seeking behavior but when I'm holding a sleeping baby or nursing him, I can reconnect with him right away. 

I'm trying to get help from my husband but he's not as in the loop on how to coach through this stuff and so he does things like try to coerce an apology or threaten him with consequences or tell him he's in trouble which just makes things worse. I find it exhausting to have to backseat drive my husband's approach and frankly my brain just can't handle it because I haven't slept in four weeks and am completely useless.

My husband's approach is to just ""let things go"" but from the experience I've had, when we drop all of the limits on his behavior things get way worse and it just makes things harder to repair. Because I'm so spent I'm snapping and yelling at everyone because I don't know what else to do. I know I'm not at my best mental health wise and so I'm trying to get an appointment with my counselor to try to work on that, but I'm at a loss for how to help my 2 year old. 

I wish my husband could just be on the same page as me and be able to help my son when he's having these challenges that I'm sure are exacerbated by my attention being elsewhere. He's been really good at helping my son with specific issues but I have to carefully walk him through a game plan every time and I just don't have the bandwidth to do that in the moment.

We bed share she’s only 5 months.. I had a great pregnancy and a great delivery. My postpartum recovery was hell for 2.5 months. I typically suffer from anxiety and depression but more anxiety. I was terrified of getting PPD. And I had no idea that PPA was a thing... it started after I finally got better.  Long story shot: it turns out I’m severely allergic to iodine (sounds harmless but I assure you itching plus hemorrhoids/newborn and just giving birth it was BADDDD) I cried everyday starting around week 3.  Then once I got better anxiety kicked in. I was scared of someone breaking in, killing me and taking my daughter or killing both of us. I was scared of driving( Still am) if it wasn’t for the fact that my car has to be fixed I wouldn’t have an excuse to use. I I was scared of my partner dying, and us being put out on the street. Anyway, here I am now 3 months later from all that and I thought I was fine. 

I’m a stay home mom,Which I love!!! But parenting with my partner is starting to feel like I’m doing most of it and I’m exhausted. it’s not that I feel like I need to go out or anything. But I just need some help. I need him to come home and take over-  shower with her, get her ready for bed. Pick up/clean up. Or at least help me do it. He helps with shower by taking her out of the shower and then getting her ready. But I don’t want this to sound mean and or like I don’t love my daughter. I love showering with her it’s a great bonding experience but I honestly just wish he could do it a few times. I feel like I’m constantly rushing, shoving dinner down my throat so I can get in the shower wash up really quick and then grab her to shower her. Then I get out and she’s usually all ready for bed. So I quickly throw something on and hop in bed to nurse her. This is mon-Sunday. And it’s not to say he doesn’t help clean. On weekends he does he’ll clean. But if I ask him to hold the baby or take her for a bit. He just holds her while he whips his phone out or puts the tv on. So then I end up taking her because I’ve told him already how tv isn’t recommended at this age plus I don’t like the idea of a phone being in her face and quite frankly. For someone who doesn’t get to see her much wouldn’t you want to just put the phone down and spend time with her?

I’m constantly reading and researching on things we decided we wanted To implement. And I’ll send links and he never reads it. But comes home and is on Reddit or playing video games. Idk if this makes PPA worse. Just explaining what it looks like over here 

I have constant fears  about my baby dying but mostly me. Every night before bed... my mind races. What if I die. And before her I was never scared of dying. I knew it was something that had to happen. But now, it’s a totally different ball game. 

I don’t know if maybe my fear is heightened because I feel like I’m the only one parenting. Like I don’t have help. Like no one could care for her like I can. I’m just so tired. (I’m so grateful to be able to stay home and I don’t want to sound ungrateful. I just want to feel like I’m in this with someone. Maybe it’ll calm my fears/anxiety.)  

I guess it could always be worse.

He's still breastfeeding and always nurses to sleep. BUT right now his sleep schedule is soooo far off from where I want it to be. He doesn't go to bed until we do, which is usually around 10-10:30. Also, just because we're in bed at that time doesn't mean that's when he falls asleep. On a good night he's asleep by 10:45-11. But there have been several nights where he doesn't fall asleep til midnight-1 am. I have to wake up at 5:30 every morning to start my work-at-home tutoring job so I don't get adequate sleep most nights. Sometimes if it's getting too late, my husband will take him into his playroom just so I can get a head start on sleep. Nights are just miserable for us and we really need a better system. Ideally I'd like to get him in bed at 9-9:30 at the latest. I reeeally don't want to do a cry it out method. I could maybe handle a small interval of crying (5 minutes tops) but I'd rather not do that if there are other options. HEEEELLLLLPPPPP!!

I posted a few months ago asking for advice on whether to bring my 15mo old DD on a 5 day ski trip or leave her at home with my mom. Well, we brought her along and it was an absolute BLAST. She did fabulously on all of our flights, looked amazing in her snow suit and goggles, had a blast sledding and crushing snow balls under her boots, and really came out of her shell socializing with the big group of friends we shared a cabin with. We didn’t try the resort daycare, it was too expensive, and I just wasn’t convinced she would have a good time (and I wouldn’t have had a good day worrying about her) so my husband and I took turns skiing, which ended up being totally fine. I’m a SAHM, so when it was my turn to ski, it was like rare me-time that I don’t usually get and I honestly really enjoyed and needed that alone time.

Rough weekend,AttachmentParenting,8,aiono3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/aiono3/rough_weekend/,16,1548204204.0,"FTP

I've had a rough weekend. We had friends over and it was just......bonkers and I'm only now fully processing that the obvious difference between how my husband and I parent and how other people choose to parent has serious consequences. 

Now. Absolutely not saying that other techniques are wrong  because that's just not true, but I strongly believe parents need to be adaptive to the kid they have. To the pregnancy you have. To the family and environment you have. 

My DD cannot handle loud noises. Her hearing is amazing and it genuinely hurts her, we don't yell. My daughter would be devistated in time out, so beyond it just not working, it would be cruel to do it. 

What I didn't expect was that if we had another child her age over that their parenting routines would effect our child as though they were happening to her too. Beyond the fact that we have seen time outside not work for my friends kids for years now, we have never seen my friend's husband as the ""one in charge"" before. 

He's absent. Like 1950's fathers took more interest in their daughters childcare. They had a baby here who basically had to scream for 30minutes solid before he would respond with anything more than an aggrivated ""YOURE FINE, SHUT UP QUITCHERBITCHING"" she screamed for so long she sweat through a polar fleece onsie. Then he had to be told how to make her food......she's a year old. He doesn't know the amount of formula, or food nor how to prepare the food. 

My husband was kind of cornered into watching our DD and the other child who is a year older, super sweet child but.....her behaviour is very different from our dd and quite destructive, sometimes intentionally, sometimes just innocent curiosity. Hut she is quite physically brutal when angry. 

By the end of the day my husband was fried from the two girls basically going at it all day while the baby screamed an hour at a time and the other father just sat on his phone screaming every once in a while. I had no idea this was the kind of dynamic my friend lived with day to day."

Anyway, now that he’s getting closer to three, I’ve started getting comments from friends and family about how “you’d better get that boy sleeping in his own room soon, or you’ll have problems”. The one main friend who makes the most comment has two kids, 13 and 17, and is taking a very “I’m just saying, I’ll be saying ‘I told you so’ later” attitude about it. She swears that if I don’t get him into his own bedroom soon, I’ll have major issues getting him to sleep in his own bed when he’s 6-8 years old.

For the first three months we were sleeping like pros, and thought cosleeping made us impervious to the sleeping problems with which most parents struggle.  The babe would wake up to nurse every few hours (or sometimes just stir without even waking), but my wife would latch her and go back to sleep.  We'd all wake up feeling rested.

Now the babe is 4 months old and oh, have times changed.

Now our 4.5 month old will kick, claw, and squirm all night from 2am on.  The babe still seems to be sleeping, but much lighter than before.  Now, my wife can't sleep because she's getting battered all night.

Has anyone else suffered from squirming-induced sleep loss? Any tips or advice? We've tried different types of swaddles out of desperation, but babe only gets more upset when her squirm cycle is interrupted. Mysteriously, we still get a rare squirm free night, which only adds to the feeling that maybe we could be sleeping better if we find the right solution. "

Normal situation is we feed to sleep in her bedroom on mattress on the floor. I go to my bedroom and then when she usually wakes once or more often twice per night I go in and feed her, and try to leave once she's done but more often than not I fall asleep with her.

Last night was rough. We tried getting my husband to settle her when she woke up at 12...cue enraged screaming for a solid 40 mins despite my husband's best efforts to calm her.

I then caved and briefly fed her, then explained that my booby needed a rest which she's understood in the past. She was happy and calm at this point but not sleepy. It then took her around 2 hours for her to get back to sleep without feeding, I think most likely because she had been so wound up. She was happily chatting to herself and tossing and turning, asking for nappy changes, calpol, water, telling her teddies they could have some booby but then booby needed a rest...bless her!

After 2 years of (mostly!) gentle, calm night times this just doesn't feel like the best way to go about the weaning process. Am I being too soft? She does go to sleep independently at nursery but obviously isn't used to it in this context.

I'm aware of Jay Gordon's approach and theMilkMeg. I just don't know if powering on through is the best option, bit feeling under pressure to wean due to medical issues and also done with the time consuming nature of it all especially bedtimes! 

So I'd be interested to hear what worked for you...powering on through the screaming or a more gentle approach if there is one! Cheers!"

She has this thing where she ALWAYS wants to be carried. We try to encourage her to walk, but it is a battle. She also screams to get her way at the moment (from food to carrying to whatever). 

Today we'd been out of the house for all of 5 minutes when she insisted on being carried. We insisted she walk a bit more. She started to scream. Normally dad gives in but I asked him not to. She tantrumed and tantrumed. We tried playing games, making it fun, encouraging her, carrying her a short way then putting her down and getting her to walk again... Nothing worked. We named her feelings ""you want dad to carry you. We hear you."" we tried ignoring her and slowly keeping moving (not leaving her behind). Nothing.

It was angry screams, she wasn't exhausted. But I hate to see her so worked up.

I finally snapped. I used a very stern and slightly raised (but not yelling) voice, as I scooped her up and carried her, and said this is not acceptable. We (named family members) are going to (fun activity) and you will go to bed and not be allowed to play with any of your toys. She was quiet. I asked if she was prepared to walk the last little bit and then she could come with to the activity. She said yes. And then walked happily home and was fine.

I hate that I reacted like that, but it did seem to snap her out of her tantrum. I know that I didn't yell too loud or use force, but it also wasn't gentle and didn't feel like great parenting. I'm not sure if she's old enough for that threat of behaving or not getting something she wants.

I don't know what she understood from the situation. I don't know if any of it was OK.

In general, I don't know when to give in. I feel thst she's getting too old to give in to her demands just to stop her screaming. Until now I've been able to calm her, name her feelings then distract, but these days it seems as though its less about emotional outbursts and more calculated tantruming.

I bedshare with LO (11mo). I go to bed when she does (8.30-9.00pm) and I like it that way because then I get a full night sleep (according to fitbit,  8.5hrs! WooHoo! Sometimes in the evening I put her to sleep and I sneak away when I have to do a few things but she'll often wake after 40mins. But by that time I'm ready to hop into bed anyway and BF her back to sleep so it's not an issue...at home.

Over the new year we will be visiting friends for 4 days which means later nights (urrrgh! I love our early nights). In the past at other's homes I've had LO fall asleep on me in the sling until I go to bed.  She is heavier now and when the chattering wakes her,  she will stay up and resists being put back to sleep,  to which I have to wait 3 hrs before she'll let me put her back to sleep. 

Which leaves me with 3 options (I think)

1.  Put her down to sleep in the bedroom the usual way (BF to sleep on bed then sneak away) and tend to her every 30-40mins

2. I have her sleep on me in the sling and when she wakes up let her stay up and go to bed ... much later. 

3. Be a party pooper for 4 days and go to bed with LO. Last time I visited I went to bed early each night and they seemed disappointed and I don't want to do that to them again if I can help it. 

What would you do? 

*** By the way,  these families do COI. They have LOs under 1yrs who sleep through so I feel a little judged as incompetent with any of these solutions.

Cue the opening of the gates of hell.

No amount of gentle talk or logic or reasoning gets through to her brain over the screaming, and there is no time because DD has to get to school and she goes to daycare. So I literally pick her up and carry her to the car, and then we have a battle trying to get her buckled. Obviously I win, but it sucks. 

She screams most of the ride. I engage her calmly, she screams. I ignore her, she screams harder. If this happens at home over something, using the bedroom time method just causes her to scream and kick the door constantly, and eventually one of my frequent check ins and ""when your voice is as calm as mine we can talk more about this"" said repeatedly during said check ins will get through the screaming and she'll start to settle and we can talk about it.

We're a no hit family, but maaaaaan have I thought about giving her a quick swat just to get her attention to change the focus, but I'm pretty sure I'd feel like shit later. Also, I know that this could be a growth spurt, because she JUST turned 5 less than a month ago.

We need a better way to get through the night!,AttachmentParenting,11,a23sg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/a23sg9/we_need_a_better_way_to_get_through_the_night/,15,1543706219.0,"We have a son who is nearly 18 months. He has bed-shared with me (mama) since day one, and dad sometimes sleep with us if it works out. We have tried a huge variety of sleeping arrangements and none seem to be working. My son climbs right out of a crib so that option is out. I’d say we are willing to try anything, but I am posting here to avoid the barrage of “cry it out” suggestions because that does not work for our son, so we won’t do that. My husband sleeps so heavily that he does not actually wake up to our son’s cries, even if they are loud or have been going for several minutes. I have to get my husband up at night if I want his help, which adds a whole new level of difficulty to this issue. My son goes to bed around 8, usually wakes by 7, and takes a 2-3 hour nap every day around 11am.

Our situation is that my son had reached a point where he was nursing once at night and once again in the morning after waking. Then, he went through a regression and has slowly built back up to almost nonstop nursing during the night. I get woken up at least six times. The pediatrician reassured me that, physically, he does not need milk at night, but that his emotional needs are likely taking over now. I almost disagree with her about the hunger, because there are times, after he has slept for 5-6 hours, when he will not go back to sleep without a snack first. I do agree that he seems to nurse most of those times at night for comfort, as he will nurse for only a few minutes before dozing back off. I have been trying to gently guide him back to sleep without nursing if it has only been a few hours or less since he last nursed, and I am still met with tears and sometimes a little fit for a few minutes. During the day he will sometimes only nurse 3 or 4 times, or as little as 2, even when I am trying to nurse him more during the day to keep him off of me at night. He is HIGHLY distractible but I feel I have done a good job of establishing nap and bedtime routines that relax him and get him to sleep effectively. I have tried things like wearing several shirts and a tight bra at night so that it is much harder for him to nurse himself, and that does help, but I am so exhausted lately that I have been caring for him in my sleep! I’ve gone to bed with my son, then woken up with a shirt missing, a boob out, and my son on the opposite side than he was when we went to bed. It also makes things confusing for him, because sometimes I try to only nurse him once at night and again in the morning, and then sometimes (when I am really tired) I just nurse him on-demand all night long without realizing it. We need a solution that can help me get rest, but I don’t know what it is. We can’t afford a nanny or au pair or anything like that, and have nobody else to help.

TL;DR: 18-month-old nurses constantly all night long. Husband sleeps so heavily that he can’t wake up with our son without my help, I am so tired I’m nursing our son in my sleep. We want a gentle way to lessen the night nursing sessions!

Cross-posting in r/parenting

EDIT: Wanted to add an update for anyone who may still be wondering! We ordered the book “Sally Weans From Night Nursing” as suggested by one user and took the advice printed in the back of that book as well.  We read that to our son several times a day for the past three days, changing the names and pronouns to fit him. My husband has already been putting our son to bed, so we kept that up with one change: instead of walking in the carrier, my husband lays with my son and lets him “nurse” on a water bottle. After that, the first night I did my best to redirect him when he wanted to nurse, repeating the words from the book. He got grumpy but would go back to sleep. He nursed once and was extra snuggly that day, but my husband has taken off of work and was able to help out even more than usual. The second night my son seemed more clingy and needy, wanted to nurse 3-4 times and I thought “Oh here we go again,” but we kept going with reading. 

Last night he did not ask to nurse one time! He fell asleep with my husband and stayed with my husband, even after waking up a few times. Once I had to wake my husband because our son was struggling a little and my husband hadn’t noticed, but the other times our son was able to settle by himself. We repeated the words from the book. **He also did not cry a single tear.** I am so proud of our little boy! Even if things flip back again today, I am happy knowing that he *can* get through the night."

I  get him back to sleep, but I typically can’t leave his room without him waking up within minutes (or seconds) of my leaving his bed. There are days I have things I want to do before the kids are up and I can’t because of his crazy sensitive mommy radar. My husband wants me to night wean him so we can go on later dates or perhaps bring the kids to grandma’s house once in a while, and actually sleep through the night for the first time in years. I would like to night wean eventually, and while husband is supportive of that goal, he is not supportive in helping me to achieve it. ( I get a lot of “I haven’t slept at all and I have to be at work in three hours” kind of push back if I ask for help 🙄)  So I keep putting it off,  
Then he gets upset at me when I’m trying to get stuff done one handed bc 2.5 yo insists on being held. I don’t mind usually. But husband insists that he’s not so clingy and plays more independently when he watches him, I can’t hold him forever, etc. 
Anyway, I’m not really sure if I’m asking for advice on night weaning or toddler sleep training or for a magic wand to make my husband less self absorbed and annoying than he has been of late.

Dinner battles with my toddler. Feeling like a failure,AttachmentParenting,16,9xjmle,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/9xjmle/dinner_battles_with_my_toddler_feeling_like_a/,19,1542378074.0,"I am completely ashamed of a number of recent failures in good parenting. I'm looking for advice on how other attachment parents think I could have handled these situations differeny.

My son is 2.5 and very communicative, which is awesome, but it means sometimes I mistakenly have higher expectations of him than what is reasonable for his age. He got into a habit of asking me to do something and then changing his mind and basically playing a game of saying ""mummy get this"" then ""I don't want that, get this"" or ""mummy leave"" and then telling me to come back. I know it's totally normal behaviour but it was driving me batshit crazy so I had the idea one night that I would try to use storytelling to help him understand why this isn't a good thing to do. I told him the folktale of the boy who cried wolf one night around bedtime. He was very captivated and asked me to tell it again. So I did. Now my son has nightmares about wolves coming into his room. Enormous failure and I feel so sad that I caused his bad dreams. Heartbreaking.

I thought that would be my all time low, but I outdid myself tonight. For the past several days my son has been too distracted or uninterested or whatever to eat his dinner. Sometimes it's because he doesn't like it, other times just not wanting to sit still long enough to eat. Then at bedtime when he's doing his usual song and dance of excuses not to go to sleep, he's telling me he's hungry and wants a peanut butter sandwich. One night it was 3 peanut butter sandwiches. 

So I thought it would be wise to try to be more of a stickler to eating his dinner and tonight we had a meal that he would normally be very interested in but wasn't even trying anything. I told him his only bedtime snack was going to be the dinner he didn't eat and when bedtime came around and he started begging for pickles, I told him he had to eat his dinner first. So he ate some, then I let him have some pickles and then he demanded more pickles and he said he would have to eat more dinner. He said he didn't want to so I said we can just go to sleep then. This is already 30 minutes past his normal bedtime. 

I lay down with him to get him to sleep and 2 minutes later he demands that I go get him his dinner. So I make very clear to him that I really don't want to get up to go get his dinner just to have him refuse it when I come back (his usual shenanigans). He says he wants to eat it so I get it and of course the second I come back he says he doesn't want it and wants to play, eat pickles, etc instead.

Well sadly this is when I start to lose my cool and I hold firm that he eat it since he made me go get it. With much protesting he eats a few bites, spills half of it on the bed, and demands pickles. I tell him he has to have one more bite of his pork. He chews it for a bit and then starts spitting it out and I'm so mad by now that I tell him he needs to finish it and to put it back in his mouth. Well of course I should have realized he was trying to spit it out for a reason...

He gags on the bite and barfs all over me. 

Now I'm feeling like shit because I clearly am not being a good parent if I'm force feeding my kid to the point he makes himself ill. He's upset. we're both covered in puke. My husband comes to help clean up but after I get my son changed into new jammies and set up with a bowl of pickles because I feel so guilty, I have a full on mental breakdown in front of him. Oh btw I'm 6mo pregnant and just a complete wreck.

Here's the kicker. I lay down in bed next to my son while my husband feeds him pickles, facing away to try to disguise my sobs and my sweet sweet boy snuggles up to my back and rubs my arm to try to make feel better.

So tell me have you ever failed your kid this hard? Have you ever broken down in front of them (I'll admit, not my first time)? How would you have handled those two situations differently? I want to be better at navigating these friction points in a way that doesn't make me feel like either a door mat or a meanie.

Thoughts?"

We were bed sharing but it wasn’t working out so great as we would be waking her if we would move around in our sleep. I swear every little noise was waking her up. We had to tip toe in and ever so quietly to get into the bed and then one little brush against something and she would start moving about. We decided to move her to her own (crib) mattress but had it set up on the floor next to ours. That worked for a couple weeks but she was still waking up if she heard us making the tiniest bit of noise; I figured maybe she was ready for her crib in her own room. I was nervous to try but if she would sleep better it would be worth a try. So we brought all of her things she needed to sleep and transferred them into her bedroom and like magic, she was falling asleep quicker and staying asleep longer; my husband was even able to put her to sleep without any fuss. It has been a month since crib transition however it wasn’t a full transition. At the end of the night/early morning, around 4-5am, I bring her in the bedroom and she will sleep for another 2 hours. I don’t know if this is confusing for her or if it’s just because we are in another leap but as soon as she’s next to me in bed, feed feed feed, wake wake wake. I know she (and I) will have a better sleep if she is in her crib but I don’t feel comfortable if it feels forced. If she won’t settle in my arms while I’m rocking her on the boob, she definitely won’t want to go back in the crib. 

Is it confusing to be going back and forth from crib to bed? I know consistency is important, she was consistently sleeping until 4-5 in crib and then nursing/cuddling in bed until it was time to wake up. But now she is waking up earlier and earlier. There are only 3 more days left of the leap, I’m wondering if those 3 days will really make a difference once they are over. I read it could be molars? I don’t see or feel any in there. I do see more bottom teeth, I think. She’s not a fan of my poking around in her mouth. I’m just so freakin’ exhausted. I lose the ability to tell myself it will pass when I am this tired.

Any advice/experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thanks mamas!"

I have a 5.8yo and a 16 months old. They have both developed a secure attachment with me, their mother.

I fear that it will be too much time for my youngest, who will be 25months at that time. 
I cannot legally stop my STBX, so I would have to appeal to his empathy and heart, but being a narcisist, he doesn't have any.

Am I overreacting? Will my little one be ok? Or should I try to fight for him not to go (or maybe not so long?)

I have been practicing 'gentle' parenting techniques (feeding to sleep, contact naps, light bed sharing, picking her up when she's upset etc), but have had a few comments that I have made her somewhat clingy and over sensitive.

She has seemed to have developed separation anxiety in the last few months, not wanting to be held by anyone other than myself of Dad (not even Dad past 7pm). I feel judged, and than my gentle/softly softly approach to parenting has caused this.

I know in my gut that everything I am doing is in her best interest, but it's so hard to not feel judged by people who do things differently. And I guess I am worried that my approach is wrong, and that I've caused her to be so clingy. Any words of wisdom will be gratefully received! x"

Throwaway because bro found out my main account. Not that I care if he sees this but I digress. 

My husband and I are planning a ski trip with a large group of friends. One of the couples is planning to take their 9 month old along and put her in the resort’s daycare while they ski. 

My daughter will be 15 months old. I am a SAHM and I have never left her for more than 3 hours as she is EBF and showing no signs of readiness to wean. She is a Velcro baby who only feels truly comfortable with me, my husband, and my mom. I’ve tried taking her to the YMCA childcare while I exercise and she’s always MISERABLE and they come get me after 10 minutes and she’s always miserable in the church nursery too. I do not see the resort daycare working for us AT. ALL. 

So basically, if we bring her along, my husband will ski a half day while I watch her and I will ski a half day while he does. We will spend virtually no time together, and we won’t get to go out to dinner with everyone as that is DD’s bedtime. 

I considered leaving her with my mom while go... I think she would miss us but she is very comfortable with my mom who also practices attachment parenting. I just don’t see how this will work because DD isn’t weaned yet. I would have to figure out how to wean her in the next 2.5 months and she is showing zero desire in doing that. My husband and my marriage could really do with some one on one attention if we’re being honest. 


SO. What would you do?

1. Bring baby and split childcare duty with spouse?
Pros: I love my kid and want to “do life” with her. She will look freaking precious in a snow suit. I won’t have to worry about weaning or feeling like I abandoned her. 
Cons: Plane/car rides aren’t her favorite. Won’t get to spend any time with hubby. 

2. Leave baby with mom?
Pros: hubby and I can spend some much needed time together.
Cons: would have to wean baby who is not ready for that, might not enjoy myself wondering if DD is miserable or thinks we abandoned her 

Help! 

99% sure we will bring her along, but would leaving a 15 month old for 5 nights harm her attachment?"
Separation anxiety of my 3 year old,AttachmentParenting,7,9p9p1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/9p9p1e/separation_anxiety_of_my_3_year_old/,16,1539901184.0,"Husband and I both have a bad family history of anxiety, so Attachment Parenting seemed important. She's on average a very bright and active kid, testing 92tle for verbal. Now I'm third trimester with her little brother and I've been home with her most days. But the separation anxiety is getting extreme. She cries out many times a night about daddy leaving to go to work, like he does every M-F morning. Then she cries during the day about how she misses him. She cries about how one day we'll die and leave her alone. She has all these goodbye rituals (hugs, I love you, I'll miss you) but after daddy leaves she cries, ""I did all of them but I still miss him!"" she is very worried about missing part of the ritual, which seems to keep getting more elaborate. 

In some ways, she's making gains. She was very upset about the prospect that  her lessons are no longer ""parent and guardian"" and accepts pretty well that I don't go in with her. We also got her sleeping in her own room by choice. 

But this regular crying is worrying me. Any ideas what is typical fear of a new baby coming and what is typical 3 year old?

"My mom keeps discouraging breastfeeding, and it gets worse the older my son gets. I’m gathering all of the data I can, so please share links!",AttachmentParenting,18,9onx4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/9onx4d/my_mom_keeps_discouraging_breastfeeding_and_it/,36,1539727543.0,"I am honestly surprised because my mom has a doctorate in teacher education and has spent her life focusing on childhood development and meeting the needs of children. She has always impressed upon me the importance of childhood, how parents set the framework for a child’s adult life, and how important it is to meet early childhood needs. She also uses research to back her claims, and will refuse to accept new information without research. 

**This is where I need your help.**

There is a wealth of research out there in support of prolonged breastfeeding (for at least two years) and I have already gathered a number of quotes from the AAP regarding both infant/toddler health *and* the mother’s health. I am working on gathering links to the actual studies that support these quotes, so if you already are familiar with one you’d like to share, please do! 

The specific arguments that she made were that 
1) the WHO recommendation of “two years and beyond” only applies to third world children who cannot get nutrition elsewhere, and 
2) that children begin developing sexuality as early as 3 years old and would be confused by breastfeeding, causing psychological issues. She has generally been unsupportive of breastfeeding and will tell me to stop anytime I have challenges to overcome, but now the claims are getting weirder and weirder. My son is 16 months old, can walk and say a few words, and can come up and lift my shirt to nurse himself. This act in particular seems to set her off. I plan to go about the conversation gently, but assertively. All advice is welcome! 

Edit: I know I added a bit at the end about advice being welcome, but I am going to go ahead and say that **I have read the suggestions about not talking to my mom and have taken them into consideration, so please only comment at this point if you have links about breastfeeding.** Thank you.

Edit2: The next time she brought it up, I began reading from the various links you kind folks have shared with me, and she shut up about it! I understand that this does not work for everyone (nor am I recommending it) but it did work for me, at least for now. Thanks again for the continued sharing of empowering info on breastfeeding. "
15mo cant sleep alone more than 30 minutes,AttachmentParenting,12,9nqh2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/9nqh2j/15mo_cant_sleep_alone_more_than_30_minutes/,9,1539427155.0,"My son has been sleeping with me since birth. Which is months before I had ever learnt about attachment parenting. He would scream if I tried getting him to sleep in the bassinet, so it just turned into him sleeping with me (and usually my husband on the couch since he works early and never wants to wake us...and our now toddler is like a fish out of water when he sleeps!). I quite quickly started to prefer our son next to me at night and started learning about attachment parenting and it's benefits. I'm so glad we started attachment parenting and I truly love it.

 The only problem is that my son can't nap or sleep at night unless he is comfort nursing or at least laying with me right next to him. This makes it impossible to get any house work done while he sleeps or spend time with my husband, since I don't (usually) need to go to sleep at 7:30pm every night! Sometimes I can manage to sneak away for about half an hour...an hour at max, but that's very rare. I love laying next to my sleeping little guy and I love the cuddles, so I more often than not, just soak it all in and stay with him, since I know it won't last forever. But sometimes I wonder what I'll do if I have another baby! He may not be through with this sleeping arrangement, and I'm not sure what I'll do then. So I'm wondering a few things:
1. Is it normal/common with AP that he can't seem to sleep more than 30 minutes alone? 
2. How do you manage with more than one child when both need to nurse to sleep and need you next to them to sleep? 
3. If I ween my son from nursing around 2 years old am I no longer attachment parenting him since Im not letting him ween himself? What are the dangers in weening him at that age? 

Thanks! 

 Oh and I should mention my son does not sleep through the night. On a really good night he will wake up twice and need to nurse back to sleep each time he wakes. On average he wakes up 4-6 times a night. I'm not exactly sure the time gaps between wakings though because I can't look at the time, it makes it much harder for me to fall back asleep. As it is, I have a very hard time falling back asleep between each waking. Sleep is hard for both of us! "

I really feel like we need to set boundaries on ""parent play time"" but as attachment parent advocates we feel almost guilty forcing him to play alone. However, his mum can't keep spending all day, every day, playing cars & trains (his two obsessions). She needs space for her own thing, especially as she suffers depression. He literally wakes up and his first words are ""Play cars?"". Her day is just playing cars/trains, and doing chores. Nothing else. After months it's really dragging her down. She has almost no time for her own thing other than a couple of hours in the evening, if that.

Do we begin to be a bit more forceful about giving mummy some alone time? Even though it will lead to tears/tantrums to begin with? It would be better for him too, as now he just as an exhausted, unenthusiastic mum. If she could get some rest she'd be far more present with him when having play sessions."

Even though I know she is with her father (whom she spends a lot of time with every day, more so with but also without me present) it just feels like I am abandoning her by depriving her of her comfort; I usually try to go with my gut, AP came pretty intuitively to me, I only found out about the term afterward but even though this doesn’t feel right, the feeling may be stemming from my own issues growing up.

We have only started yesterday with him trying to put her down for naps and considering how much she protested, maybe I am doing this too early? Or maybe even too late, I could have included him more in the beginning. 

I know that it is okay for her to protest a little when dad tries to take over but I am wondering if there is a limit to how much she should be protesting; I’m worried I am pushing her to do something she isn’t ready for, even if it would benefit everyone but I can’t really explain that to an 11 month old. 

My apologies for my frequent posts lately, this is my first and I would like to make sure I’m doing the right thing for her. I know that it is very important for her to feel a secure and safe attachment with caregivers other than myself so if there is any way that I can help make this transition easier for her, any advice would be appreciated!"

She is wonderfully happy, secure, confident, kind. People actually make comments about this all the time. But she has never slept through the night and I’m tired.

Like many, we originally started bedsharing as it was the only way we could get any sleep. Around ten months she started rolling away from me after nursing to sleep and we could finally leave her in the bed (our mattress is on the floor and we put pillows al around. Never had an issue) and get some alone time in the living room. But that is where the progress stops.

Over a year later and she still wakes up constantly. I don’t mean just two or three times. It’s every hour or so to start with and becomes more frequent in the early hours when she then stays attached to the boob until she wakes at 6am demanding to get up. 

I’ve tried night weaning but it was a disaster. If my husband tries to comfort her during her first wake up (when we haven’t gone to bed yet ourselves) she screams and screams and gets out the bed looking for me in complete hysteria. 

We tried not nursing her to sleep at bedtime but she just couldn’t get to sleep and after over an hour she was entering her “crazy” over-tired stage where she gets all confused, upset and weird. 

When I’m actually in bed asleep, I don’t know how to refuse boob and still get some sleep. 

I’m at a loss as to what to do!

Similarly, she sleeps so lightly during nap time I often have to lie down the whole, or majority, of nap with her and I am so frustrated. 

What can I do?! I’m just so tired. I just want a decent nights sleep and for my evening time with my husband to not be interrupted after 45 minutes! I don’t feel this is too much to ask after two years.

Feeling thankful today for my difficult baby,AttachmentParenting,29,9exw2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/9exw2y/feeling_thankful_today_for_my_difficult_baby/,4,1536703856.0,"So, I have a Velcro baby. She is high needs. I never expected a baby to be so clingy, so needy, so much work. I know there are easier and more chill babies and she’s just not one of these. I’ve stressed about it, I grudgingly accepted it, and stressed some more. I’ve wished she was different. But lately I’ve realized that I am actually glad my baby made me into the type of parent I am- one who constantly is holding her, wearing her, and one who doesn’t make her sleep alone. It’s tough and if it’s not temporary than my life balance would be totally out of whack, but for now I am really loving it and so thankful for my difficult baby, for three main reasons:


1. It alleviates my guilt at leaving her. I have to work a few days a week, there’s no way around it. And it’s hard because my gut tells me I need to be home with her, and I simply can’t be. But knowing that she gets to be near me every night and attached to me when I’m home really helps me think that she is still feeling secure and she is developing a sense of security. At least I really hope so. It makes going to work tolerable. 


2. Nights are fragmented and often uncomfortable, but I don’t go to sleep wondering if she will wake up and cry and when, and I can check on her whenever I want. When we were trying (and failing) to make her sleep alone I was always slightly on edge waiting for the crying to start, and when it was quiet I’d worry she wasn’t breathing anymore. I truly don’t think I’d be much more relaxed if she did accept her crib (or at least not at first). I like knowing she’s getting some calories at night, too, because I’ve always been worried about her weight gain and although it’s never been an issue, I still love when she eats. So whenever she wants to eat, that makes me feel so good. 


3. Most importantly, I realize that I will never have the regret of not cuddling my baby enough. I can’t put her down and I can leave her when she’s sleeping for at most 30 minutes. And this felt like jail for a while, but I realized that it means I will never look back on this year and wish I had held her more. Because it quite simply would be impossible for me to do so! 😅 So I try to treasure each nap and each bedtime. I watch her sleep so often and yes I wish I had time to do other things too but I won’t be able to watch my baby sleep and cuddle with her forever. Because there will come a day where I will pick her up for the last time, or there will be a last time she sleeps on my chest and a last time she will nurse. There will be a time she wants her own bed. And on that day I will be sad but I will never question myself or wish I could have just held her longer. 


Sorry for such a long post I am just feeling very thankful today for things I have seen as burdens for almost 6 months now and it’s amazing to be able to flip them around as positives finally!

We're fortunate to have extended family nearby and can expect to have a grandparent available for childcare one day a week. We're going to need to each do 4 days of work outside the home, though, so will need to have kiddo in daycare probably two days by the time they're 15-18 months old--maybe even three days. 

This is already freaking me out a bit--I think a lot of the stuff I have worked through with a psychologist stems from early feelings of abandonment, and I don't want to do that to my child.

New throat-clearing tic in seven-year-old really getting under my skin!,AttachmentParenting,10,9cocug,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/9cocug/new_throatclearing_tic_in_sevenyearold_really/,8,1536031260.0,"Hi parents! Can I have some help please? 

Something I've noticed just in the past week or so is that my seven-year-old daughter is doing a quick little clearing of her throat very often. I'm talking, maybe upwards of eight times a minute. Sometimes much less. I've asked her if it's her throat bugging her and she says it's phlegm in her throat, but it's not at all a phlegmy sound. 

I'm concerned that it's a vocal tic. She is a very sensitive child, but also has good self-esteem and is outgoing, fun-loving and happy. I'm happy to say that her father and I enjoy a good, conflict-free marriage and we are both really hands-on parents. Her little three-year-old brother can get on her nerves, but mostly they love playing together and they don't fight. She hasn't got a mean bone in her body and is so motherly to him most of the time.

Now, I researched a bit about vocal tics and I know the best thing to do is to just ignore it, but it is bugging me! The reason it is bugging me is because I'm worried that it might mean there is something psychologically wrong with her, and that if there is, 1.) it would break my heart for her to suffer and 2.) I would feel like it were my fault, because I had a tic as a child (I used to flip  my hair back all the time) and I ended up being diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder and struggling with anxiety and depression (which, thankfully, I am in recovery from).

The OCD for sure runs in my family, and mine was brought out so much because I had a traumatic upbringing in that my dad drank to much, verbally and emotionally abused us and was a very scary guy. Not all the time consistently, but enough times that it was really tough growing up sometimes.  Thankfully this is not at all the family environment my daughter is being raised in, but I still worry.

Can anyone give me advice or reassurance? Should I take her to the doctor just to rule out that it's not anything like throat or lungs?

I have always nursed her to sleep which I enjoy doing. She has a strong nursing association. It wasn't a big deal in the beginning, she would only get up when she was hungry maybe 2-3 times a night. If she ever woke up due to gas or any other reason I'd nurse her back to sleep, even if she was just suckling.

Now she is up 5+ times a night. Sometimes within an hour of hour down, sometimes within an hour before getting up! She will latch, drink a little or just suckle, fall asleep and let my nipple fall out of her mouth and then wake up realizing it's gone and we start over again.

I try letting her fuss hoping she will fall back asleep but she just roots like crazy and starts getting upset and I'm too tired to fight her. I don't see a solution without her crying and giving up the nursing association which I think she is just too young for.

We don't do time outs and most definitely do not spank or anything. We have tried to be gentle in our corrections but he doesn't respond. For example, we just imposed a rule that he has to ask before touching his sisters because he has a habit of beating up on them. He doesn't listen  so recently we have gotten more harsh with him and I hate it. I feel like an awful person but he listens and starts behaving. (This is mainly for behaviors that endanger him or others). I don't want to be that kind of parent but I feel there are no other options. "
"Bedsharing, co-sleeping...I know you're tired of hearing this but it WILL get better",AttachmentParenting,17,98yfnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/98yfnw/bedsharing_cosleepingi_know_youre_tired_of/,6,1534835347.0,"Hi friends, I guess I'm writing this as a kind of consolation post, the kind of thing I really needed to read about 5 months ago. From day one with our son we've been practicing attachment parenting, including bed-sharing. LO slept wonderfully in the bed with me, but I wasn't getting much sleep. No matter what I tried I couldn't settle down and sleep, as I was so aware of his presence and so afraid of hurting him or not waking up if he needed to nurse. We tried to get him to sleep in the bassinet, but he REFUSED. Like, our parents would come over and chastise us for not trying to get him to sleep in the bassinet. Once they saw how he would screech the moment he touches those sheets, they changed their tune. As long as LO is being held or in his baby carrier, he sleeps wonderfully. Otherwise he just won't sleep.

This made for a lot of sleepness nights and sleep deprivation for DH and I. Our routine was basically, I would hold LO and DH would sleep, then we'd trade off and he would hold LO while I slept. Then, when I wasn't so utterly exhausted, I would bed-share with LO and kind of just doze until he woke up.

It was hard. Like, really hard. DH and I have been so cranky towards each other. I'm doing my PhD and it's been so difficult to get anything done given how exhausted I am. LO is five months old so we've been dealing with sleep deprivation for five months. Then, suddenly, we noticing something. As of a few weeks ago, LO would start to fall asleep in the baby carrier, but he'd get super squirmy. He also wasn't sleeping that well in our arms. He also hated sleeping in the car seat. We started thinking, okay, maybe he's sending us a message, but we didn't want to get too hopeful. We put him into his bassinet on the off chance that, hey, maybe he'll sleep for 10 minutes. But he slept THREE HOURS in that damn bassinet. And get this: we picked him up, I nursed him, he fell back asleep, we put him back in the bassinet. AND HE STAYED IN THERE UNTIL 9 AM. I woke up in a panic thinking something horrible had happened, but nope, he was happily asleep.

I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that he can self-soothe now. When he's sleeping in the bassinet I'll sometimes hear him whimper or groan, at first I would rush in to grab in. But when I hung back for a few seconds, I noticed that for the first time ever he was now putting his thumb in his mouth, re-adjusting, and falling back to sleep on his own. We're well aware that regressions can and will happen, and we're ready for them. But I really feel that he's doing so well sleeping now because we didn't push him, we answered his cries right away, and we gently supported his sleeping until developmentally he felt ready to sleep on his own.

Obviously your mileage will definitely vary. But we were all starting to think that this kid would be sleeping in someone's arms until he went to college. With the next baby I'll do it all exactly the same: be gentle, supportive, patient, and sensitive to his cues."

So I get that except I’m starting to get freaked out that nursing to sleep isn’t working anymore and then I’ll be stuck! I guess I’m just looking for words of encouragement so I don’t plop her in the crib (to cry) when I’m feeling defeated. "

I read someone’s recent post which mentioned worrying about not getting enough REM sleep and that’s where I feel I am at right now. My daughter is 9.5 months old and we co sleep. I nurse her to sleep for her daily nap and at night time (and then however many times throughout the night). About 2 months ago she started teething, a lot, it’s mayhem in there and she is looking for a lot more comfort from me and the boobs, especially at night, which I give to her, but it’s literally sucking the life out of me. She stopped caring about her pacifier a few months ago and now I am her human pacifier, she will suckle for what seems like forever, multiple times a night (on top of her regular night time feedings) and when it seems like she’s finished and asleep, I try to take my boob away and she cries until I give it back. I tried reintroducing a different kind of pacifier but she still wouldn’t take to it. I ordered another different kind today and a friend suggested I keep it near her toys so that maybe she can get interested in it all on her own. I’m hoping that works because I still want to continue our sleeping arrangement. I know it must be a phase because of the teething and she is also due for another leap in just a couple more days but I still feel like it is hard to reassure yourself when you are in the middle of it all. I can’t help but feel like a bad mama for feeling so frustrated with breastfeeding altogether. Early this morning I told my husband that’s it I’m done bfing, which I don’t mean but I feel so guilty for even feeling this way."
Baby waking up constantly overnight,AttachmentParenting,7,96oqkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/96oqkb/baby_waking_up_constantly_overnight/,8,1534104673.0,"I posted here previously about bedsharing and I’m happy to report it’s going well. I am more comfortable now that I arranged the mattress on the floor so I have more room, and I think it’s as safe as it can be. I feel like my baby really loves being so close to me all night and I want to do that for her. There’s no reason for her to sleep alone all night- though hopefully she gets to a point where I can sneak away for a little while! 


Now my issue is the constant wakeups. It varies but most nights she only sleeps for an hour at a time, and she just wants to nurse or rather be attached to the boob. Eventually I can unlatch her and she goes to sleep, or sometimes I fall asleep with her there. But I am basically being woken up every hour and never sleep deeply. 


I don’t feel too sleep deprived during the day, but I worry about long term for not ever really getting a REM cycle! She’s almost 5 months. Did I create a monster or is this a phase? 


Edit to add: she is good about falling asleep initially- someone just has to hold her and it doesn’t take her very long to fall asleep- she is like clockwork in that she keeps to her schedule really well. Also she will sleep longer overnight- up to 5 hours if she’s sleeping on a person (doesn’t have to be me.) She will stir and readjust herself but she doesn’t need a boob to go back to sleep if she is on someone’s chest. "
Struggling with my son,AttachmentParenting,17,94yjoq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/94yjoq/struggling_with_my_son/,7,1533561571.0,"I really wanted to be a gentle parent. I love the idea behind attachment parenting and as a child of narcissists, it’s really important to me to support my children as they grow... the problem is that I am epically failing at it.

I’m currently 6 months pregnant. My little guy is 2 years old. My husband has been away for the last month and will be gone another month and a half.

I try so hard to encourage my little man gently to do the right thing but he is so SO wilful and sometimes I just don’t have time for a 60 minute negotiation.

I also work full time and my pregnancy has been anything but easy. So my stress levels are at an all time high while hubby has been gone. 

A common issue we have is getting into his seat in the car. He LOVES to muck around and will often spend as long as possible climbing around the car instead of sitting in his seat. It’s fine some of time time but on the mornings I have to drop him at daycare and get to work, I don’t have that kind of time. I’ve had to struggle against him, kicking and screaming, to buckle him in on more than one occasion. 

He’s started also having these intense meltdowns where he screams and cries for aaaaages. When it’s happening he doesn’t want me to comfort him or touch him, if I talk to him it just makes him escalate. The only thing that I have found that is remotely effective (and even then not very effective) is sitting and looking at things on my phone to try and pique his interest. 

Sometimes it gets so hard to keep my cool and I feel so guilty as I have lost my temper in the past and hissed at him to “shut up” or “just get in the car” through gritted teeth. I slammed the door the other day after struggling to get him in because I was so wound up. I feel awful afterwards and this is NOT the kind of mother I want to be. I don’t want to lose my cool with him or yell. I want to be available and kind and loving.

I just feel like everything that I was trying to avoid as a parent is exactly what I’m doing right now. How do I turn this around? What are your suggestions for working with the little ones who don’t respond well to discussion. I’ve tried giving him choices “do you want to climb into your seat or do you want mummy to lift you up”. I’ve tried counting “mummy is going to count to 3 and then she’s going to help you sit down”. I’ve tried bribing him - which just ends up in him demanding more and more each time I do it. 

I would really love some advice, anything is helpful!"

Our five year old boy has always been a bit difficult to get to sleep but on the whole he’s reasonably consistent. In the past few weeks he’s had a big change that’s frustrating the hell out of us and making bed time a misery. 

He’s mostly in his own room now with me laying on the second bed in his room while he goes to sleep. Lately he’s been refusing to sleep in his bed and sharing the other one or asking me to sleep in his bed with him. When he does this however,  he kicks, hits and rolls onto me. If I get up out of the bed after telling him I don’t like the behaviour he follows me around the house doing things like hitting or pinching me as he laughs. 

He’s a lovely kid and this is about the only time he displays such behaviour but it has me worried and frustrated. 

Any thoughts?"

Bedtime makes me hate being a mother and honestly it’s what is preventing me from wanting any more children. I just can’t stand it!!!!! It seems to me that the most logical solution would be to just stop doing it right? But that feels wrong too. I want to stop laying with her until she falls asleep. We never could do cry it out when she was a baby because I believe it’s wrong to leave a baby to cry but she isn’t a baby anymore. She’s 3.5 years old. I just don’t want to mess her up if I stop laying with her. It’s just that night time is so not peaceful anymore. She jumps around the bed and on me and it makes my blood boil. 

After laying with her and her jumping around and bumping me and talking for 40 minutes I got irritated and told her I was leaving and I’d be back in 5 minutes. I’m laying in bed with her sibling putting him to sleep and now I think she’s asleep less than 2 minutes after I left. So what gives? 

I always felt bad for my cousins’ kids who were left to cry it out every time they cried but now they are all good sleepers who go to sleep on their own and hardly cry at all. And my child who I cared for so lovingly and tried so hard to form a secure attachment with is a terrible sleeper, has had a huge attitude this past week, and bites her nails half the day.

I wish I wasn’t like this. But on nights when it takes her like an hour to fall asleep I’m crazy grumpy and short and frustrated. I’m telling her I’m going to come back later because it seems like she’s not ready for sleep, I’m telling her to lay down and stop getting up, etc. I wish I could be more patient but I haaaaaaaate bedtime. I hate it. The nights when my husband puts her to sleep are the highlight of my week. I can relax on the couch finally and clean in peace and not feel guilty about not giving her my attention because she’s sleeping. 

We’ve tried everything.  Later bedtimes, less sugar, soothing bedtime routine. Nothing makes a difference. She just takes a while sometimes to fall asleep and I don’t have the patience for it. I know looking back I’m going to hate myself for being so short and I’ll be wishing she would want me to lay with her until she falls asleep again.

Night weaning and naps/nursing to sleep.,AttachmentParenting,4,907drs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/907drs/night_weaning_and_napsnursing_to_sleep/,9,1532046628.0,"Hi everyone. My daughter will be turning two in a couple of months and I want to nightwean. I’m over it. I wouldn’t be terribly upset weaning completely but I know she is not ready for that so I’m ok with still nursing in the day. 

We have a couple of night weaning books we are reading to her and will try in a couple of weeks once we’ve got her really familiar with the idea. 

My question is- do you also stop nursing to sleep (the initial going to sleep?) when you nightwean? Maybe a silly question as the answer is probably yes or it would be confusing. But she’s so good with her bedtime routine. It’s the nursing 50 times in the night I can’t stand. 

Also- what about naps? I currently nurse her to sleep at nap time and often have to lie and nurse her for most of the nap. I need to be able to get up and have time to myself/do things. The weaning book she likes the best talks about milk (well nursies but we replaced it) sleeping when it’s dark but naps are obviously in the day. Any advice?

We plan to have her still sleep in our bed as I thought it would be too confusing and upsetting for her going into her own bed. But does anyone have a different opinion? At some point we want to move her to separate a mattress in our room for at least part of the night. 

Edit to add: it had crossed my mind that some kids might just nurse less at night if they are in a separate bed. However I don’t think this will be the case for her as she often wakes up between going to bed at 7.30 and me going to bed at 10.30 calling/crying for milk! She sometimes even wakes 2 or 3 times before I go to bed! Similarly she can’t sleep through a full nap without nursing."

I'm not even exactly sure how to ask this but I'll give it a shot... do you attachment parents ever get a baby sitter for your children? My LO is 12.5months and I have never had a baby sitter for him, not even his grandparents. I am a stay at home mom and I've just never had to go anywhere that I couldn't take my baby with me. My husband and I really want to be the only ones that care for our son (especially while he's so young) but next week I have an appointment and my mom just assumed she would be babysitting, (since my husband will be working) and she's excited about it! I could take my son to the appointment, which was actually my plan but now my mom thinks she will be taking care of her grandchild for that hour. She doesn't parent or discipline the way we do which makes us a bit nervous.

1. Do you ever get a baby sitter? 
2. Am I over thinking this? Does the thought of someone else caring for your child make you nervous?(First time mom here...)
3. Should I just tell my mom I want to take my son with me to the appointment? If so, How do I say it to not offend her? 
4. If you don't agree with getting a baby sitter, what do you do when you have to go to an appointment or something that your child can't go with you to?

"Another ""help me get my child sleeping independently"" post",AttachmentParenting,8,8zmovr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/8zmovr/another_help_me_get_my_child_sleeping/,1,1531874221.0,"Hey AP! It's a common tale: my husband and I have bedshared with our daughter since birth. She's now 18 months old and I think she's showing signs of being ready to sleep independently. We are ready too. I'm also 19 weeks pregnant, and the idea of bedsharing with a newborn AND my toddler doesn't appeal to me, not least of which because it feels unsafe.

I've done some research and it seems like my options are:

1. Switch to sleeping with my daughter in her own room, then gradually move myself away (start out in her big girl bed, then a mattress on the floor, then move the mattress further and further away until I'm out of the room).
2. Keep her in our room and essentially reverse the above process: start putting her down in her own mattress and gradually move it away from our bed.
3. Go straight to her sleeping in her own bed, in her own room, and go in to reassure/comfort her when she wakes up during the night until she gets used to the new arrangement.

Are there other options you've had success with? What do you think is the best approach? I'm especially interested to hear from parents who've done this with a child around the same age. My husband and I are not comfortable with a lot of crying; we can tolerate a little if we know that SHE knows she's safe and loved.

Bonus question: We are moving to a new house next week, and I don't want to overwhelm our daughter with the move + sleep changes all in one go. How long do you think we need to give her to adjust to the new place before changing the nighttime routine?

Thanks in advance!"

We go to the park often and one of our friends comes over with her son often but she won’t play with him anymore either. She runs away screaming from him if he touches her or gets close to her. 
One of my lesser moments was bribing her with ice cream if she would go play with the kids at the park. She had been watching them play chase so I told her if she played with them she could get an ice cream when we got home. She played chase with them and was laughing super loud the whole time so I know she had fun but she lost interest after a couple minutes and wanted to play with me.

I initially intended it to only last 3 months, then 6, then a year... When her sister was born, I weaned her and she transitioned her to her own bed, which was mostly successful for a bit, but then she would come back into our bed in the middle of the night sometimes. But she still needed someone to lay with her to go to sleep. But my husband works shiftwork and I couldn't do it by myself once her sister wasn't an infant anymore. When my husband was working she ended up sleeping with me again. Fast forward and now they're 5.5 and 8.5 years old. Over the years we've tried to get them to sleep in their own rooms or even together in one of their rooms but they are both so scared. They cry and can't fall asleep. They know that we're not going to stay laying with them the whole night and want me to promise that I'll stay, but I don't want to lie to them, so then they cry just at the thought of me leaving. My 5 yo is so afraid to go into her room on her own. When she has to go to get a toy or clothes, she has to get someone to go with her. We got a trundle bed for my eldest so that our youngest could sleep in there with her, but she's too scared to not literally be next to someone while she sleeps. 

Even in my bed, she has to be in the middle because she's so scared of the edge of the bed. She she's even scared if we try and have our eldest sleep on her own (and her dad will lay with her) because nobody is on the other side of her. We've tried making ""monster spray"" but it really didn't work.

My husband is sleeping in our youngest's bed every night and we both need to reclaim our own bed and bedroom. Now that they're so big, I'm getting kicked and pushed and hair pulled all night and I don't sleep well. I'm so done with this! 

I was hoping that they would eventually just want to sleep on their own naturally, but now that my 8 year old is approaching 9 and she's still so scared to sleep on her own, it scares me that it will never happen. We even have a dog and we thought that would help them not be as scared (didn't work), we also already have an alarm system. We try to explain how safe they are, that there's no such thing as ghosts and monsters, etc., but to no avail.

Part of me feels like I've created two monsters by bedsharing, but I also know that I've given them years of snuggles and happy memories (hopefully 😂). "
Afraid of bedsharing,AttachmentParenting,9,8xgc67,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/8xgc67/afraid_of_bedsharing/,28,1531199746.0,"So from researching online it seems like I am in the attachment parenting camp. I believe somewhat the opposite of a lot of people and books and blogs in that I feel like I am just going to give as much love and attention to my daughter (4 months) as possible and that will be the foundation by which she will self soothe and learn to sleep on her own. Everything I read suggests the opposite, like I am spoiling her or that I am ruining her by holding her to much and allowing her to nurse to sleep or not making her sleep alone. She just won’t, Ive tried. And I’d rather just give her all the physical contact she clearly needs and let her develop at her own pace. 

Which brings me to bedsharing. My husband is a night owl and he has been holding the baby for a shift every night basically from week 4, or when I decided that I couldn’t keep waking up every hour. But now baby sleeps longer- like at least a 6 hour stretch and husband holds her the entire time! That’s too long. He says he doesn’t mind as he’s working on his computer but still. 


After that stretch I take her into bed with me. I sleep lightly and she wakes to nurse about once an hour. I feel like I never sleep too deeply so it doesn’t bother me. We share a firm mattress, a twin, in the nursery, against a wall, and I do no blankets but a sleep sack thing for her and a pillow under my arm. I am following every guideline I’ve ever read, except some say no pillow at all. The bed is on a frame but she isn’t rolling yet and we have plenty of room. I am not obese, I don’t drink or smoke, and we EBF. Baby is 13 pounds (but she was 3 weeks early and only 5lbs at birth.)


Even so I am still really afraid to bedshare the entire night even though it would be the best option for us right now. It is slightly uncomfortable for me but I think I would deal with that. But I worry. What if I forget she’s there? What if I somehow roll on her? I do put a pillow between my legs too. 


Do you think these fears mean I shouldn’t bedshare? On one hand I’m afraid but on the other hand I feel like it would be fine and that I am very aware of her and that once we tried it I’d be a lot more confident. But if anything happened I would never forgive myself..but this child will not sleep alone either so I am kind of stuck. Any advice, suggestions? Safety considerations? Anecdotes? Thanks! "

It's been happening consistently for quite a while now as well as him biting my shoulders or legs to get my attention...I used to think this was because he wanted to nurse but now he does it even when he doesn't want to nurse. I'm feeling so incredibly discouraged as I really want to nurse my son for another year (if he wants to) but he is starting to leave longer lasting marks on me and really starting to cause me pain. Has anyone else experienced this? What did you do or what would you recommend? I have tried pretending to cry or show my self in pain and he thinks it's funny. I should also mention, when he is actively nursing he does really well and still does ask to nurse (pulling at my shirt or even sticking his hand right into my shirt).

I've just started reading Dr. Sears ' book on discipline but it doesn't seem to give many tips on biting (that I've found yet) besides pressing your child's arm against their own top teeth so they know how it feels. I tried that today and he didn't even react. 

I'm so terrified of having my child grow up with an attitude/behavioural problem as my brother was high need as a child and was definitely considered a ""bad kid"" in school. And now as an adult he lives a scary, risky, dangerous (and sometimes illegal) lifestyle that I am terrified of my son ending up doing as well. 

Also, if anyone out there has a child who was high need as a baby / toddler, but has turned out pretty great now that they are beyond the toddler years, some words of wisdom and encouragement would be so greatly appreciated as well! 

Thanks in advance! "

Anytime he is scared, hurt, upset, angry, he asks for milk.  I've been going along with it, while wondering more and more to myself if I was doing the right thing, if he would ever be able to calm himself without nursing.  Suddenly over the past 2 weeks, he has started occasionally asking for hugs when he's upset instead of milk! I'm so excited that he is learning to deal with his feelings like this and proud that I went with my gut and didn't take his comfort nursing away before he was ready.

What do you say to the cosleeping judgers to politely get them off your back?,AttachmentParenting,11,8uzu9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/8uzu9h/what_do_you_say_to_the_cosleeping_judgers_to/,16,1530366672.0,"I'm loving the ap community here on Reddit and really resonated with the previous poster who felt judged by a community nurse. Hoping I can get some help about a similar struggle I'm having.

Today a friend who I don't see very often confronted me about my decision to cosleep. We are expecting our second and, although we didn't right away with the first, are 100% planning for a cosleeping setup with number 2. Number 1 (2yo) is just starting to sleep through most of the night in his room but still joins mum and dad on the big bed for the wee morning hours (or more if he's sick, teething or anything else that needs some extra love).

So this friend was adamant that we should be sleeping independently right from the start with our second so ""we don't end up with the same problem we have now"" (in so many words...). I said we're all actually very happy now that we've realized it's the right thing for us. I said that I like it and she essentially said that it's not right for my son. It felt like an implication that I was damaging him. The conversation was interrupted and I didn't rush to bring it up again, but I definitely left feeling hurt and shamed.

I'm at a point now where I don't take this to heart as much anymore - I used to second guess everything that my gut was telling me and feel completely ashamed when people would cast those judgements. now that I've found the literature and community to back me up I feel more secure in our choice, but I still struggle to know how to respond to these Inquisitions.

I'm a science minded person and my feeling is that there is lots of great evidence to support cosleeping and other ap practices (this is what got me straightened out when I felt like my gut was defying everything that my doctor, parents, in laws and many friends were telling me). But it's a tough thing to get into on the fly.

So I'm curious if other cosleeping families have found some good responses for overly nosy naysayers? I'd love to have some quick ones in my back pocket for the next time this inevitably happens..."

My mil is generally really supportive of my parenting ideals, but mentioned it would be good for her to be sleeping through the night once we have a newborn. This is something I hadn’t thought of. How do you manage night wakings with multiple kids???

Our setup currently is LO on a full size mattress on the floor in a room next to ours. I nurse to sleep and go back to my bed. I don’t think it’d be safe to have to small children sleeping together. "

From what I’m reading posts wise, this subreddit seems like a safe place to discuss co sleeping/bedsharing (which might I say is very awesome because I personally don’t know any mamas who co sleep with their babies so yay I’m not alone!) I just had a question in regards to night time feedings, my now 7 month old still eats a few times a night; I will try to take note of how spaced out the feedings are but they are usually 2-3 hours apart. Now I wouldn’t have thought twice about it but when we went to see the dr at 6 months, they were asking if her feedings were at least 4-5 hours apart during the night. I said yes because for about a week it was 4 hour stretches but we were staying at my mother in laws and my daughter was in her own crib right next to us during that time (bed was too small for my husband + baby + me). I guess I am just wondering if that’s normal/ok at this point in time; maybe it’s different for co sleeping babies because they are closer to our milk supply? I’m thinking if I had a donut or fresh bagel baking next to me while I slept I would wake up more often wanting to eat lol.

I’m curious to hear how some of your experiences were with night time feedings while co sleeping! Please share anything if you have the time :)"

I know others succeed in their babies sleeping independently from the start even, or for naps, that just hasn't yet been one of my goals. LO wakes minutes after being put down and remains awake for all walks in his pram. I'm starting to babywear and he sleeps great there.

My husband is at home with me so holds him when I shower and so I can nap for an hour or two by myself. This morning he wondered when little buttster will start to nap in his bassinet, and I realised it hadn't occurred to me to try yet. One, I enjoy it this way so far, two, I don't want to start struggling with him to do something I want if he's not ready which might increase the stress when I'm only getting the hang of things, three, my husband helps so much so I haven't needed to.

Soon my husband will be away more so I will need to go to the toilet and make food on occasion! 

What might be a gentle way to start, or what have people found helpful? Shall I try put him down when he's asleep, then when he wakes up nurse him to sleep and return him again, and repeat many times? Place him there awake until he gets upset?

I'm not sure if it's due to that or if it's coincidence.

She's just turned 19 months old and has been very much a mama's girl. We were on holiday and I needed a break, she was whinging about something and I lost it. I handled her roughly, I threw her drink bottle on the floor and I raised my voice. She could barely croak out ""daddy"" through her shock and distress. I hugged her, but still slightly hysterical said that I am not coping and need a break! She cried for her daddy, and I didn't let her go to him because he was sick in bed. He ended up coming and taking her from me anyway and going outside to cool off.

Since then, she has wanted to go to my friend (another mum) and cuddle with her, cries when her dad leaves the house, and has become seemingly more attached to her daycare teacher, kissing pictures of her and even pointing to me saying the daycare teachers name.

I feel sick about how I acted, but Im absolutely desolate about what the result seems to be.

Is this a direct consequence? Or a stage/coincidence? (the timing is pretty uncanny). Can I ever repair this, or will her trust in me forever be a bit fractured? "

Since I commute quite a bit and love podcasts, I was hoping some of you would have stumbled upon a podcast on this topic. I'm an little picky about my podcasts on that I like them to be well researched and put together. For example: Food For Thought. 

I searched under Peaceful parenting and whole brain child. There's were some that looks promising and I will give them a try, but I'm not looking forward to sifting through not-so-great podcasts until I find something good! So if there's one you like, please share it with me!

As much as I love bedsharing with my toddler and cuddling her, I need my toddler to sleep well at night and during her naps.

How do I transition my toddler into a separate room with her own bed?

Bed sharing newborn - sleeping on side ok?,AttachmentParenting,4,8iewf1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/8iewf1/bed_sharing_newborn_sleeping_on_side_ok/,9,1525987945.0,"Edit: Thanks everyone!! That’s reassuring! It’s very convenient although the fact I can’t move makes for such a stiff back!!

Hi all, I read the La Leche League Sweet Sleep book which I loved and am bedsharing with my 1 week old. We have a cosleeper I’d like to scooch him into at some point too occasionally. We nurse sidelying and fall asleep that way. Rolling him onto his back (despite holding him tight etc) always wakes him. In addition he has significant tongue tie which thankfully was snipped today but it meant each feed has been totally excruciating for me so I’m afraid to stir him as I’m nearly delirious with pain particularly after clusterfeeding all night. The pain should resolve in a few days when my nipples heal.

Have people regularly slept with baby facing them on their side? I understand on the back is safest but how worried should I be? Bearing in mind we sleep for no longer than 2.5 hours at a time, my blanket is far down my waist from his face and he always has plenty of room to breathe. "
Horrible pediatrician visit concerning sleep training,AttachmentParenting,19,8hqwke,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/8hqwke/horrible_pediatrician_visit_concerning_sleep/,14,1525755189.0,"My Little One hasn't been sleeping very well for the past month. She' s 6 mths old and teething, but I took her in to see the doc to make sure there weren't any other physical reasons for her sudden inability to stay asleep. The only advice our doc had was to start cry\-it\-out sleep training. She wants us to put her down awake, leave the room. If she cries, wait 15 minutes before going in to comfort her. If she cries after that, wait 20 minutes, then 25, etc. 

 Now, my mother did this type of sleep training for me, and then repeated it when I was around 4\-5 years old and having sleep issues again \(parents divorced\). I remember it. It was awful. I remember crying, calling for her, and nothing. No one would come. I know that's a different type sleep training than my doc is recommending, but I can' t do that to my kid. 

But that's all she had to offer. Not one other tip or trick for helping her sleep. She basically said it's this or nothing. She made it seem like I was crazy for not wanting to do this. She asked if anyone in our families had a history of anxiety or sleep issues, and I told her I did. Then she asked if I had a psychiatrist, and told me to see one and get medication to manage my anxiety. Now, what she asked was about *history.* I do not currently have a problem with anxiety. Even if I did, WTF does that have to do with not wanting to sleep train?!

So I wasted a copay, an afternoon, and I still don't have any ideas to help her sleep better."
Teeth brushing,AttachmentParenting,14,8hempk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/8hempk/teeth_brushing/,14,1525635003.0,"So. We've tried everything. All the different brushes, all the songs, with toothpaste and without, getting her to do it first, getting her to do our teeth, getting a second toothbrush in while she's brushing, letting her choose an awesome toothbrush, making games, all the apps, making sure she watches when we brush our teeth, brushing her soft toys' teeth, rewarding tooth brushing with an awesome thing like stickers or playing with the torch.  We give her the illusion of control ( you can brush with the pink or blue toothbrush. You can brush them in the bathroom or we can sit on front of your bedroom mirror. Etc). We wipe her tooth with xylitol wipes while she sleeps, 3 times a week. And brush teeth twice a day, but only manage one section per session (ie: front teeth morning, back teeth left side at night, etc). 

She is getting better but soooooo slooooowly. 

She's had 2 dental check ups with a paediatric dentist where she would barely look at him while clinging to my neck. He didn't even really get a good look at her teeth other than some pictures on my phone I took while she was sleeping. He noticed a small amount of plaque but said he'd be able to get it when he gets into her mouth at subsequent visits. But she's still very shy, and still so very adamant about things she simply does not like.

I know all toddlers are stubborn little people. Her daycare providers have mentioned to us how she seriously can not be convinced to do things she does not want to do.

She's 2.5. Someone please tell me you've got a similar little one and that they now brush their lil toothy pegs diligently and have reversed any early tooth decay?"

I've got into the habit of staying with her during naps. I think it's time to give her the chance to learn to resettle herself like she has been of a night. She still has two naps a day.

She is 8 months old. We eat at home most of the time, and will usually opt to have people over to our house instead of going out to a restaurant. 

We are going out to eat tonight at a restaurant, and I don't know how to functionally do this with my baby. This is where I'm struggling:

1) If we were doing anything else, I would opt for wearing her, but eating is something I can't do while wearing her, because I'm large chested and I can't reach items on the table if she's on my chest. I don't want to risk dropping hot food on my baby.

2)I would bring in the stroller and let her sleep in her car seat, except the restaurant is rather small, so there won't be a place to park it.

3) I considered putting her in the highchair, but at home if I put her in her highchair, she will only stay in it for about 10 minutes before she starts crying and wanting to be held. Ten minutes as her limit whether she is playing with toys, food, or just sitting there.

4) She is getting very mobile, and she likes to reach for things. As it stands, I figure that we will plan to just hold her and pass her between us, but I am dreading playing ""keep away"" with her the entire night, trying to keep her from getting all the items on the table. She is doing a lot of leaning her whole body toward things she wants while in our arms and it gets physically exhausting after a while. 

How do/did you ladies manage your 8 month old at a restaurant? I will take any thoughts, suggestions, or tips. Thanks!

Update: The dinner went well. We opted for just carrying her in our arms and bringing a few toys. She got a new book in the mail today so we waited to show it to her while we were in the restaurant. We sat her between us in the booth and that actually worked well for us. Apparently it was kids night at the restaurant, so she had plenty of other little kids to watch. We also brought a bottle (I EP) so she ate a snack before the meal. I didn't share any of our meal with her because it was Thai and was spicy. "

Shorter naps in crib,AttachmentParenting,5,8d64qz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/8d64qz/shorter_naps_in_crib/,7,1524091361.0,"Thanks in advance for reading (kinda long). 

Hi everyone. I never really planned on choosing a parenting style but attachment parenting is just what seems to work best for me and my LO. He is almost 9 months old and we have been co sleeping/bed sharing  since he was very little. He never liked to be swaddled and would always struggle and try to break out or roll over. He never liked pacifiers either. I am a SAHM and my husband works a lot so I never really got the opportunity for others to bottle feed him or watch him. Daddy never does night duty. This works fine for us for the time being.

So my question is about nap lengths. I can get him to nap in his crib sometimes. I feed him and place him down asleep. Drowsy but awake has never worked but I haven’t tried super hard for that. The thing is his naps in his crib are almost always short, like 20-30 minutes. Whereas if he is held and sometimes nurses back down he sleeps longer. Like an hour or more. If I try to do crib naps I worry about him being overtired. And sometimes he won’t even allow a crib nap (wakes up when he is placed in the crib). 

Should I just try for crib naps only and deal with a tired baby for some time? Will he ‘learn’ to sleep longer in the crib if I was more consistent? How long would that take?  I’m just going with the flow right now but wondering if maybe I should be more consistent. I love holding him and miss him when he’s crib napping. But it’s also nice to have a few minutes alone to drink coffee or read or whatever. I’ve also heard naps can affect night sleep so I worry about short naps or even too long naps making him wake up more during the night. Although I haven’t seen much of a pattern in that regard. 

In my heart I believe that he will develop these skills at his own pace and I should just go with the flow. But sometimes I doubt myself and wonder if I’m giving him enough opportunity to do so. For what It’s Worth he is a super happy baby. Never cries at night I just nurse him as many times as he wants (a lot lol). I don’t know if this is from anything I do it just might be his nature. But I feel very blessed that he is so content most of the time. 

Thanks for reading and any advice!

Tl;dr: will shorter crib naps get longer if I am consistent with them? Will they affect night time sleep? What is your experience with this? When did your baby start napping in a crib if ever?

If I had a time machine I probably would have not even bought a crib or bassinet. 😂

9-month old fixating on forbidden things,AttachmentParenting,6,8bmzxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/8bmzxq/9month_old_fixating_on_forbidden_things/,8,1523530509.0,"I just need some help redirecting my baby’s difficult behavior. Right now he is in a new phase of only wanting things he is not allowed to have, which is not much (things are pretty well baby-proofed). We are trying to teach him to avoid the bad things. Usually he goes over to the outlet (or whatever), I say “No, leave it alone,” he pauses, I run and grab him and reward him for stopping by giving him a toy or a book. This worked great from 8-9months old. Now he is just being really ornery all the time but particularly with this. He will fixate on the one thing he can’t have and just repeatedly try to get it over and over. Saying “No,” makes him giggle, and then he seems to think that getting the forbidden object is a game. I have tried taking him to another room entirely, but he remembers the second we get back to the original room and will try even harder. There is only one room that is 100% babyproof, the nursery. Everywhere else is like 95% but we have to plug our lamps in SOMEWHERE and set our drinks down SOMEWHERE.  Anyway, he becomes more and more obsessed with getting whatever it is that he starts to writhe and kick the second we are back in the room to the point where I have nearly dropped him. He wants down. Then when I inevitably have to redirect him from the forbidden object he will reach a point where he completely loses his s***. Throwing himself around, screaming, hyperventilating, choking on sobs, the whole thing. I just let him ride it out on the floor. I have tried to comfort him but he will then try to nurse, which I haven’t been letting him use to soothe (whole other story) so we end up in a new tantrum. He will allow my husband to comfort him but not me because...boobs. He does this when he is not tired or hungry, but obviously the behavior is 1,000x worse when he is. He will often get up and leave our daily activities we do together (like reading) to go do this so I don’t think it is an attempt to get attention. This seems like a developmental phase, but he has made bathtime an absolute nightmare because he spends the entire time trying to stand and play with the faucet and turns the whole thing into a wrestling match. He has 37 different bath toys that I have tried to use to distract him (one at a time, all at once, you name it I’ve tried it) and even doing habitual singing or reading bath books does not work. He has thrown the entire bath routine out in favor of endlessly obsessing over the faucet and getting pulled from the tub in a tearful fit.

Help! I really need to get back to gentle basics and I don’t know how. These tantrums are happening multiple times daily now and increasing (it was just one every few days). "

I'm looking for advice, what worked for you in getting your toddler to their own bed?

I have a delightful 2.5 year old. I'm still lactating and he nurses a maximum of 5 times a day, sometimes twice. That was a hard fought battle for me. When the breast is empty and he still needs comfort, nursing hurts. He doesn't nurse at night anymore (another hard fought battle). He has been almost completely potty trained 2 times then changes his mind. I usually sleep with him. Sometimes I can escape after he is asleep, fall asleep in my partners bed right next to my son's bed on the floor. He usually crawls into my bed at some point in the night. 

He loves to nurse to sleep but on occasion he won't. He usually needs snuggles to go to sleep (sometimes I rub his back or sing him to sleep). We have some big changes coming up. We are moving to a new city, he will be starting day care full time, we will be leaving my partner in our old city, I will not stay at home anymore and will work up to 70 hour weeks, he is getting a live in Nanny and new babysitters, he is getting his own room and his own bed. My bedroom will be right across the hall from his bedroom. 

I need a Nanny because my new job means I am on call, and sometimes I will be leaving at 2 in the morning and I can't be waking him up while I'm getting ready to go. How can I utilize her in this transition? Should I switch her to bedtime duty? Should I stop nursing him to sleep?

Do you have any ideas on how I can make this a smooth transition for him? I can't get him to stay in his own bed as it is. For this reason I don't think slowly moving his mattress across the hall would work, because he will just crawl into my bed anyways. Should I keep his bedroom door and my bedroom door open so he is not afraid? Should I lock him in there? 

On the rare occasions where someone else puts him to bed, he tends to stay in his own bed all night. My partner is going to put him to bed 2 nights while I am out of town this week.

What do you think? I am not sure if I am piling too many changes on at once, but I'm ready to stop breastfeeding and he is Not."

I've been struggling with what I'm pretty sure is PPD for a while and it was pretty bad recently. I've been over breast feeding and wanting to wean for a good 3 months now.

As much as I wanted my DD (17 months) to just give up on her own, I knew that if i weaned her, I would want to hold her while she cried and let her let all her feelings out..

Last week I was in a seriously suffering place mentally. Frazzled nerves, no patience, hating life.

We are down to morning nursing now. A few days ago she woke at about 4am, came into our bed for a cuddle... And within a minute the idea occurred to her that she wanted to nurse. I was so frustrated not because I didn't want to nurse as such, but because it annoyed me that we couldn't just cuddle without her pawing at me. She let loose and... I'm ashamed to say I yell-cried ""no, just PPLLEEEASSE"" or soemthing to that effect. She was instantly silent. Lay there for half an hour, silent. Then asked again and I nursed. I offered her in the morning, which I never do, but I was feeling so bad about it.

Since then... She has hardly nursed. One morning she skipped it altogether, another she just latched on then popped off again. I already feel like my PPD fog (metal and physical) is lifting, and it's technically baby-led which is exactly the way I wanted it to go... Except for how it started.

I feel so awful that I didn't let her express her feelings about this extremely important life changing thing. I know it won't seriously damage or traumatise her as such, but I still feel as though she will carry a little bit of that with her forever. And I can't celebrate or enjoy the fact that she's weaning. The moment I've been waiting for for months. She's a very very sensitive child with a memory like an elephant. I have so much regret and I can't go back and change it. I hate HATE that this is how I weaned my daughter. Not with love and understanding, but with scaring her into submission/potentially tarnishing her experience/memory/whatever of breastfeeding. "

We chose attachment parenting when our first was born in 2011. It worked a treat. First baby was weaned at almost four years old when new baby came in 2015. It happened very naturally because my milk went away during pregnancy. First baby was also a very easy going one!

Our baby is now almost three, like I said. He still wakes me up to nurse anywhere from three to six times a night... maybe more! And even that doesn't always help because he's starting to get annoyed that the flow is tapering off. 

I've always been a light sleeper. I haven't had a full nights rest since having him in 2015! I also am in recovery from anxiety and depression.  Recovering from this was a hard one thing. And it's an ongoing process. I've done a lot of research and I know that a good night's sleep would really benefit me and my mental health. Making me a better, healthier mum.

I'm just so tired sometimes. Like so tired that I will feel fuzzy headed. I love my son but I think it's time to wean from both bed sharing and breastfeeding. 

Before my husband went skiing in Switzerland this past month we were doing pretty good. He was sleeping half the night in his own bed which is in our room. And I was trying to not feed him at night. But when my husband was gone it got too hard so I just slept with him in our bed.

Now he wakes up multiple times and cries until I feed him and even then he takes sometimes half an hour to settle with me rubbing his back. 

I also have a 6 year old to look after. I need to be well rested. My husband says I should go away for two days and that would sort it but I don't want to traumatize my dear son.

Any ideas?

Bit of a brag (we're all doing great!),AttachmentParenting,34,82nvs6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/82nvs6/bit_of_a_brag_were_all_doing_great/,4,1520454359.0,"Ok so this is a bit of a brag, because I don't really want to share all the deets with my real life mates or family or even my mum because... well that just seems a bit rude, and it's so easy to come across as offensive to someone else's parenting style. But I also want to encourage all you lovely AP folk :)

We had a psychologist appointment for our sensitive 2.5 year old recently. She had been having a bit of a hard time settling in to day care. She was in the middle of turning a corner there at the time I made the appointment, and a week later, just before the actual appointment had gone from distressed and anxious to simply protesting and normal toddler tantrums. But considering an extensive family history of anxiety disorders, the psych thought it best to do a 20 minute observational study on her anyway (stranger test type thing) to see what coping strategies she currently uses in stressful situations and if any of her coping mechanisms are maladaptive or harmful or the start of mental illness. So we did that and she was her normal sensitive self.  This week I had the follow up to go over the video and get feedback on her coping skills and mental state.

Essentially, the psych got mine and my husband's permission to use the video as an example of what a securely attached child should look like for parenting classes. Our daughter has great self esteem, and even though she's very sensitive to intrusions in our 'circle of security' (which is healthy), she trusts that we're there for her, and trusts what we say ('I'll come back' etc). The psych said there is no indication of any anxiety in our kid, even though there was previously. And if we parented any other way, her separation from us at daycare would more than likely have spiralled instead of building a good foundation.
She said the empathy I showed was rare to see and that more people should of parent that way, and it's not being soft.

So keep it up! Don't doubt! You're all doing such a great job! We're in it for the long haul! Raising confident, independent, caring and strong people! Yay!"

I get in and soothe her but after the third episode she completely freaks out. Will not stop crying until I pick her up (I refuse to let her freak out for too long, and I’m never not immediately by her side when she wakes up).

We have co-slept since she was little, and we are begining to wear down just a little too much from all of the energy we have put into her. Spring is around the corner, but in the meantime we have decided that a good solution to help the overall energy and vibe in our home is to make sleep a little more peaceful.     

We put our king mattress all the way on the floor and moved a twin mattress next to it. We get dd to sleep on the twin then sleep on our king until she wakes up for her first night feed, at which point she gets a little sad, crawls over to me and sleeps their until morning time. It sucks that she gets upset for a couple minutes, but the 3/4 hours of deeper, not twisted-to-form-to-baby sleep makes me such a better mom the other 20 hours of the day.     

So my question is when do they naturally feel okay with sleeping on their own? Like, when do kids typically wake up and not feel panicked or upset that mom or dad aren't right there? I'm willing to keep her next to us as long as she needs, but with winter exsaustion I really need to be able to see some sort of a light at the end of this tired-mom tunnel!"

It was well past time for bed (we had Girl Scouts tonight and that runs late).  So there was no wiggle room for staying up.  She pouted for a bit and when I didn’t relent she full on sulked.

I said “Sometimes being tired makes bad feelings feel *extra* bad.  I’m sorry you’re upset but your body needs sleep”. And she refused to give me a goodnight hug and to do our usual night night lines.  I said “I love you and we’ll try again tomorrow.” and left her to be.  I was mildly upset because we almost never have bedtime issues.

About 10 minutes passed and I hear a little “Mom?” from her bedroom.   I answered and she came padding out to the living room and said “Mom- I’m sorry I was angry.  I wanted to stay up really badly but I didn’t mean to be angry.”

We made up and did our tuck in again this time with lots of hugs and cuddles and routines.  I am so proud of my girl for reaching out to reestablish our connection and so thrilled with AP techniques for giving us that foundation.  Stick with it folks!"

I’ve got a 12 month old that is the sweetest, silliest thing. But holy hell is she running me and my husband ragged. I feel like I may be choosing the path of most resistance with some things and just not know other ways of doing things so I could use some advice on ways to get some sanity back. I’m committed to AP practices since they feel instinctively right to me but I’m feeling like I’m losing steam. 

My husband and I have no time alone. We live abroad so there’s no family to help. None of my friends here have kids yet - we were the first. We live in a 2 bedroom apartment so there’s some space but not a yard or anything. Plus, it’s winter so there’s nothing to do outside. There are a few high school kids I would trust to babysit but my kid goes ballistic when left with strangers. I know this sounds insane but I also feel guilty leaving her with someone she doesn’t know just so I can go to dinner. Guhhhhh mom guilt. 

Cosleeping is starting to wear on me more than usual.  She nurses to sleep and then goes down in her crib around 7-7:30 and stays there until the next time she wakes up after I go to bed. Sometimes she’s asleep from 7 til 11pm, sometimes she’s up every hour - it varies greatly but she’s been tending towards 3-4 hour stretches at a time in her crib lately. Then I pull her into bed with me, which is our couch, pulled out into a bed in the living room. (Firm mattress topper on it so it’s safe to cosleep.) My husband sleeps alone in our bed in the next room. I know this sounds absurd. We tried cosleeping in the same bed but he would wake up every time she stirred and couldn’t get back to sleep. Plus we only have a queen sized mattress so it was a tight squeeze. 

I wake up 4-5 times a night, maybe more, because she’s stirring. She doesn’t fully wake up but will roll over and start crying in the 3 seconds it takes me to nurse her. She often rolls around and gets on all fours and then starts crying until I move her onto my chest nurse her. Sometimes rubbing her back works. My sleep is complete shit. 

She’s in daycare during the week since I work full time but on weekends we cosleep for naps as well. I put her in the wrap and sing her to sleep WHILE nursing her and pacing my apartment. This is exhausting, and many times she won’t go to sleep anyway. I’m lucky if she takes one long nap a day at home. Today she napped for 30 minutes in the morning and that was it! I’m losing my shit. She takes 2 very predictable naps at daycare everyday, amazingly. 

My husband is fantastic and cooks, cleans, spends time with her so I get a break, tries to put her back to sleep if she wakes up but often she just gets more worked up until I bring the nips in. He hasn’t had success getting her down for naps. 

I just feel so isolated and so, so tired, even after a year. I never feel rested. I feel crappy about my body since I’ve GAINED weight after her birth from breastfeeding and feel like a dairy cow most of the time. I love nursing and want to continue but I don’t feel like my body is my body. 

What am I doing wrong?  Any suggestions to improve our sleeping arrangements? I am not at all interested in any form of cry it out and do not want to wean until she’s ready, but is there anything I can try to help get some of my sanity back? I miss my husband and I miss myself. 

UPDATE: Major improvements in the past month. Pushed her bedtime back from 7 to 8 since she just wasn’t tired and was taking an hour to get to sleep. Now she sweetly nurses and coos and drifts off within 15-20 minutes.  The biggest win was dropping the morning nap - I think she was just ready for it. She’s in a great mood all morning and then takes a nice long nap from about 1-3 or even later. And because she’s actually tired and ready to nap, I just lay down with her and she nurses to sleep without me having to pace around my damn apartment! So naps are sweet cuddle time now and it’s great again. Thank you everyone for the advice and support! It means so so so much. "
Please advice - bedsharing but awake for 2-3 hours per night,AttachmentParenting,3,7x4gb0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/7x4gb0/please_advice_bedsharing_but_awake_for_23_hours/,15,1518501890.0,"At our wit's end with baby's new 'normal' sleep pattern.

Our 5.5 month old has bedshared with my wife since birth. It worked great for the first 3 months or so. My wife nursed her side lying and got a good amount of sleep. However, the situation has been progressively getting worse. LO would often wake up in the night but reject the breast and there take a long time (20-30mins) to go back to sleep. This happened at least 4-5 times a night. We thought it was the infamous 4 month sleep regression and accepted it at that.  We eventually survived it and thought things were moving along. LO went back to her 10-12 hours nights with 0-1 wake ups. 

This past 1.5 weeks however, things started shifting in a brand new way. LO would sleep her first stretch of 5-6 hours and then be wide awake as if it was daytime. My wife insists on continuing to rock and attempting to nurse her during this time as she believes that LO is just in between sleep cycles and need to be nursed back to sleep. LO would succumb to my wife's rocking but as soon as my wife lays her down beside her, she is wide awake again. Then my wife would continue rocking and the same thing repeats itself about 4-5 times during the span of 2-3 hours. 

I've tried to help my wife by taking LO in my bed until she rubs her eyes and shows signs of sleepiness, and let my wife sleep in the meantime. My wife isn't happy with what I do because she thinks that LO will be sleep deprived but she is not functioning well with this new pattern. And neither am I as we're both awake for the 2-3 hour duration.

What can we do to improve the situation even the slightest? 

Thanks so much in advance.

But I just picked her up from her uncles place. She had waited patiently for half an hour without distractions in situations she would never do so for me, not even for 2 minutes. She sat on a toilet for them, which she always says no to for us. And they even managed to tell it it was time for a nap, and shut the door on her, and she didn't make a peep... and slept for an hour. Even at daycare they have to pat her back to get her to sleep, and at home the only way I can manage it is by taking her for a car ride... like if I just lay down with her she just gets up and plays. And if I leave a room for more than 10 mins she comes for me. And she only just started napping again after dropping it entirely for about 2-3 months...

No signs of self weaning on the horizon. In fact he’s very protective of my boobs, and likes to switch frequently. “Another one?” “There it is!” “Mine.” “My milt.[sic]” “Milt time!”
I do not want to wean, but I’m also very, very tired. Not sure if I want advice or just commiserations.

This tired Momma can't take much more.

I'm a first time mom of an amazing, beautiful, curious, ""very alert"" 7 month old boy. I worked as a nanny for over ten years and have a degree in early childhood development. I thought I would have this whole parenting thing in the bag. Holy Crap. I was so wrong. I'll quickly go through the first 7 months by saying, the kid doesn't like to sleep. No swaddle, no swing, no bouncer, screamed in the car seat, and was wayyy too interested in everything to sleep in his stroller. We slept with him in arms for 3 months. But he at least was sleeping a little. By 4 months, he was sleeping 6+ hour stretches waking once, I'd nurse him, and he'd go back down for another 3-4 hours. I thought I had made it. I could easily make it for years to come on that schedule. Then came the teeth. He's currently working on teeth 5 and 6, I can see the bottoms pressing into his poor little gums. I know this is hurting his sleep, but oh my gosh, he was up every 90 mins last night. He's been waking every 2 hours for a few weeks and I kept telling myself it would get better but now it isn't and I just am so so tired. I'm starting to get anxiety as bedtime gets closer. I don't have it in my soul to let him cry, at all. I also think he's too young to start night weaning, right?  I just need someone to tell me he will sleep soon and that I won't ever have to let him cry. Literally all but one of my friends did CIO. Like I asked people I haven't spoken with in years desperate for some glimmer of hope. Am I doing something wrong? I just don't want to mess up, I don't know how to be anymore honest than that.

**Update** First of all, thank you. This is the most support I've felt since becoming a mom. I can't begin to describe the overwhelming gratitude I feel in just not being so alone. Sometimes, people surprise you in the most perfect ways.

Second, my son slept worse last night than the night before. First thing this morning I brought him to his pediatrician. I wanted to rule out anything making him uncomfortable other than teeth. I was terrified that he would recommend we start sleep training. To my sheer delight he didn't! In fact he said he thinks my son is starting to have a little separation anxiety and is waking up just to make sure I'm still close but needs some help getting back to sleep. He says my son is normal and he promises B will sleep again.... although he didn't give us a time for that ;)

**Update #2** For all you wonderful parents that took the time to give me advice, thank you! Last night, B slept. He woke only twice!  A beautiful 4.5 hour first chunk of sleep,  then 3 hours, then 2 and up for the day. I know this will ebb and flow, but at least now I am armed with the confidence to continue picking him up and nursing him at night, to cuddle him for his naps if he needs it, and to trust that my child will sleep when he is ready. Thank you!"

She looked at me with her big blue eyes, trying to understand. She sat there and stared at my chest. I asked her if she felt sad that the milk was finished, and she nodded. She tried to get into my top gently a couple of times. Then she cuddled and was so sad.

My heart broke. I feel so so so awful when I think about it now. I regret it so much. I just want to go back and say no it's OK sweetie, you can nurse. I am almost hoping she'll ask again tomorrow so that I can say yes. Even though I was so resolute today that the weaning starts now.

If she does ask again, and I continue to nurse her from now on... I've still broken her trust. The thing that has always been unconditionally available, was now once not there for her when she needed it. My heart is broken, I can't believe I did that to her.

Weaning off sleep associations,AttachmentParenting,5,7pqr0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/7pqr0g/weaning_off_sleep_associations/,7,1515729153.0,"I'm not sure what to do here. My daughter (nearly 15 months) has over the months developed a comfort/sleep association. She likes to put her hand on my chest or neck, and when that's not available, my face. I've noticed she'll do it when she's tired and sitting in my lap or if I'm carrying her, and she's done it for a long time when falling asleep in the front pack.

At night I lie down with her to go to sleep, have done for months. I guess I never noticed that she'd built up this habit so badly.

It's now at the point where she can be soooo tired, but will just resist sleep for an hour (either keeps sitting up, or trying to cuddle me, or lies there eyes wide open), until I give in and let her put her hand on my chest. Once she does, her eyes literally roll back in her head before she closes them and goes to sleep. Sometimes she pants briefly in relief.

I'm wanting to wean her off this, because I'm concerned about her dependency on it. For one thing, she won't let anyone else put her to bed. For another, she seems to be waking up more frequently, and needs to put her hands on my chest to go back to sleep. Which means that I have to go to her before I go to bed, then during the night she ends up in our bed, but still wakes up and panics until she rolls over and finds me. I wouldn't mind so much but she moves her hands and fingers too so even if she's sleeping, I'm not.

I'm just not sure if I'm doing the right thing. The frequent wakings could totally be a coincidence and just a phase - she also has times where she sleeps really well. I'm concerned that this association will get stronger over time, yet I'm also worried that I'm forcing her to give something up before she's ready.

I would just cuddle her, but she immediately tries to get her hands on my chest so I end up putting my hands and arms over my chest and face to cover them, which she hates so she cries and turns over and all I can do is pat her back and reassure her. She won't hold my hand, she won't accept any other replacement offer.

Should I just let her snuggle and do her thing a while longer? Or am I doing the right thing in trying to break this association before it becomes even more of a problem than it already is?

Extra info: she sleeps with a pacifier, is still breast fed when she asks for it and at least once in the night, and has a cuddly toy that she's attached to but that she throws aside in favor of me at sleep time. "

I've posted before about some problems we have with our nanny. At the end of last month, we decided it's time to transition our 1-year old to part-time daycare. She will be in daycare 3x/week, for 6 hours each day.

I don't know how she's going to react to being there. She is fascinated by other children and loves to play and run around, so I think there's a chance she will love it and I'm worrying over nothing. But I'm worried because things went really badly when we tried making me unavailable to her during the time her nanny is here (I work from home, and we tried having me work out of sight.)

my question THIS time is in regards to sleep. my daughter is a year old (13 months today, actually) and she’s never enjoyed sleep. i’ve had to hold her for the vast majority
of her naps since she was a newborn. in fact, i remember the day she didn’t fall asleep in the car (8 think she was 2 weeks old) and instead started screaming and i was like “oh my gosh, this doesn’t happen? babies always sleep in the car?” 

but anyway, nights have always been some sort of okay. we breastslept for a long time but found she sleeps better in her own room. plus our bed is too small for her anymore and getting a newer, bigger bed just isn’t a financial option. 

ANYWAY, anyway, she’s sttn a handful of times, but that’s definitsly NOT her M.O. she’s a really sensitive kiddo so anytime there’s ANYTHING even slightly amiss within her body or mind it wrecks her sleep completely... teething, growth spurt, learning to point at things, whatever. 

QUESTION:
is it a variation of normal for a little to wake 6+ times a night at 13 months? i know there’s tons going on developmentally right now... it just feels like this is a product of my crappy parenting or something. (that would be the easy answer anyway 😝). i’ve taken her to the doctor and she’s fine. i’m just so damn tired, y’all. and so is my partner. 

tl;dr - my 13m old still wakes 6+ times a night and i just wonder if she’s the only one."

Keeping baby from falling off foot of bed,AttachmentParenting,5,7n3ysh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/7n3ysh/keeping_baby_from_falling_off_foot_of_bed/,14,1514695665.0,"We didn't plan to cosleep but between 4-5 months in, sleeping in our bed part of the time was just what worked best for all of us. 

Sometimes he is really squirmy and rolls while sleeping but I am a light sleeper and with my partner and I on either side of him we have felt like things are pretty safe overall. He is just over 16 months now and last week, for the first time ever, rolled out of bed while sleeping. However, he rolled off the foot of our bed, not the side. He was totally fine and seemed most bothered that it woke him up but of course it makes me worry about it happening again and him getting hurt. 

I think the issue was that I was way overtired so I didn't wake up like I usually would when he started tossing and turning. I have been looking for ways to protect the foot of the bed but can't find any good options. So many of the side rails won't work for the foot of a king-sized bed.

I've posted about this before. Sleeps at daycare no problem. Will not go to bed for her dad. We've tried for over a month, having him come in at bedtime and she hates it. Tries to tell him to go away.

I've put her to bed and gone out, but then she woke up and screamed and screamed for half an hour til I got home because she wouldn't Re settle for him.

She has a great relationship with him, sees him every day, adores him, will let him calm her down if she's upset if I'm not available.

I thought it would help if I weren't there at bedtime. Went out to a work function. Told her beforehand that I was going out, dad would put her to bed and I'd see her in the morning. She pointed at dad, at the bedroom and vehemently shook her head. When it came to bedtime, she screamed and fought him, so he put her in the Carrier and walked with her outside. She fell asleep, as she always does. Then he tried to put her in bed. She woke up and if course wouldnt resettle for her. She screamed until she was choking and almost vomiting, all the while pointing to leave the bedroom. He finally took her out, read a story and then of course she was happy as. Awake, started playing, but happy. Which is when I got home, having been called back by him.

It doesn't help that he doesn't seem to have the confidence, but I can understand him not wanting to put her through that kind of distress either.

She doesn't feed to sleep, but after me lying with her for an hour, she was finally dropping off and decided she absolutely had to nurse.... So she got a nice bit of my glass of wine too.

Terrible mum,AttachmentParenting,5,7k2cig,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/7k2cig/terrible_mum/,10,1513398280.0,"(cross-posted) I was a terrible mum tonight. 

My daughter (14 months) is going through a developmental leap. Today was my first day off in weeks and I spent it rushing around and running errands. Tomorrow we are hosting friends for Christmas dinner (husband is cooking). I wanted to get the cleaning done tonight. I put daughter to bed and make a start. 15 min later she cries. I go in, she settles. Every time I leave she cries. Then she sits up and I think oh fuck she isn't tired any more. I bring her out and ignore her while I clean.

I'm so stressed about the cleaning. I just want to get it done. She is obviously tired. She keeps losing it. She wants to go to bed. I try three times but she just lies there (quietly so she obviously wants to be there, otherwise she gets up) and doesn't fall asleep which means I can't leave. I know. I KNOW that I should put her in the Carrier and give her some time, because tonight she needs extra support. But do I do it? No. I get grumpy. I get her up. I get more frantic. I have to walk away and vent and get mad... But Clearly she hears me or realizes or knows I'm walking away from her in anger because each time she stops crying and stands there and I come back and she's white as a ghost and wide eyed.

I handle her roughly and speak sharply when she puts her hand in the toilet im cleaning and mouths the cleaner.

Again. I know what she needs. But I am being so obsessive about finishing what I started, and so frustrated abourt things not going to plan, that I don't.

Finally I finish. I take her to bed. She lies there. I ask would she like to go in the Carrier. She indicates yes. She snuggles in and falls fast asleep. Two hours after she first went to bed. 

I can't stop thinking about all the sharp words, the raised voice... I've almost never done that with her before, it would have all been so confusing and worrying for her. 

I hate myself. So much. I honestly don't even have the words to describe myself. Selfish and stupid and horrible excuse for a human come to mind. I'm actually so disappointed and heart broken for my daughter that I can't even manage to feel angry yet. I can't believe I did that. What a... What a... I don't even know. "

This is my first time posting here, I usually hang out in r/breastfeeding and had one unsuccessful foray into r/parenting.

Are any of you work at home parents? My husband and I both work from home. We have a nanny to help out with our 11 month old daughter. The nanny takes her to story/play time at the library in the mornings, and for the rest of the day they are home. We have been trying to find a way to set some boundaries so that we can get work done. If we're within sight of our daughter, she sometimes plays fine on her own or with the nanny, but often wants our attention. So we started working behind closed doors, just last week. But now we can hear how upset our daughter is (unless we wear earbuds, which we do most of the time) all day. She has a quick meltdown when we leave, which I think I could handle, but then she'll just be sad and fussy for hours while we're out of sight. Then, when we come back up (to nurse, in my case, or for lunch or at the end of the day) she is super clingy and just not herself.

We're new at this. Do any of you have experience to share about this sort of semi-separation? Thanks in advance!"

Thoughts and questions at one year,AttachmentParenting,9,7ekg7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/7ekg7d/thoughts_and_questions_at_one_year/,11,1511321370.0,"My baby turned one year old a couple of weeks ago. The past year has been a whirlwind. Not what I expected but wonderful nonetheless. But now she's at this big milestone I'm left with a lot of thoughts and questions.

 I love this sub- I read through past questions a lot just to know we are not alone, so I thought I'd write my thoughts here. I'm not necessarily looking to change anything at this point- but I would love to hear anyone's experiences that are similar to mine if you feel like sharing. :)

We always planned to meet our child's needs but not necessarily to bedshare. But bedshare out of necessity we did and we were/are very happy with this decision. Our current set up is she nurses to sleep on our bed (at an increasingly late hour because she seems to be in the ""one nap is too little but two is too much"" kind of stage and can't sleep until nearly 9pm. She wakes at 7-7.30 though so it's ok.  We just go with it. She's always adjusted her naps herself eventually).  If I'm not too tired I role away so my husband and I can spend an hour together. However, when we are not in the bed she can't sleep past 45 mins, sometimes even just 20 minutes (!), without me resettling her. She only resettles with boob. I do this maybe once, occasionally twice before I just stay with her. She used to fall asleep on me on the sofa but she doesn't like doing that at night anymore and I prefer her falling straight to sleep in the bed anyway so I can actually cuddle my husband or get up to use the toilet/make a drink :) 

During the night she stirs a few times to find the boob but she has much longer stretches of sleep when we are in there with her (no idea how long as I'm asleep and barely wake to help her find the boob). In the early hours of the morning she become very restless and stires frequently until waking up for the day. 

For naps she either sleeps on me while I chill on the sofa or falls asleep on the bed then I roll off to go and do something else. If my husband is alone with her he usually takes her out for a walk and she naps then. 

Naps I'm fine with because I enjoy the snuggles but I guess my thoughts are... will she ever sleep more that 20-45 minutes without me in bed with her? I would love to spend time with my husband without thinking I have to rush in to settle her any minute now... Though like I said- I'm not necessarily looking to force a change, but I'm interested in others' experiences. 

The other thing I wonder about is nursing as well as drinking water.  Happy to keep nursing at least another 6 months, or a year or whatever feels right for us both. I still enjoy it and baby is a boob addict. I've always thought nursing to sleep is great- don't understand why people stress themselves out and don't use this tool. But I'm also thinking will she ever stop needing to nurse to sleep? I can see her weaning herself from nursing for snack/food in the day but I can't see how she will ever stop nursing to sleep and when she stirs during the night. I know other people seem to night wean first but I just can't see it.... again, not trying to force that change right now but just wondering.... 

And one more thing. For those of you that pump, at what point did you either stop pumping or have baby drink from a cup instead of bottle? I pump just once or twice a week (I work four or five hours one day a week when husband looks after her and then occasionally go off and run errands or see a friend for a couple of hours and my husband looks after her. We've never left her with anyone else ). My husband says she usually wants milk during this time and she is having it from a bottle. But we aren't supposed to give bottles after one, right? However we use an open cup for her to drink water, not a sippy and she would waste a lot of pumped milk from that. She won't drink from a sippy, straw or those magic rim cups. I guess I'll just keep leaving milk for as long as she keeps drinking it, but should I try to get her to drink it from a cup?

I also worry that she hardly drinks water. We offer it with meals and if they are out for a long walk or something my husband usually offers water. But she drinks maybe a few sips here and there. I don't know what to do about that. I know breastmilk is high in water but at some point she needs to up the water in take. 

Wow. This turned into a mammoth post.

TL;DR I'm not looking to force a change but I wonder how long my daughter will nurse to sleep/ at night, when I'll get a block of time with my husband in the evening and if she drinks enough water."
How often do you use smartphone in front of baby? + phone guilt/worry,AttachmentParenting,9,7e5p2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/7e5p2o/how_often_do_you_use_smartphone_in_front_of_baby/,17,1511174775.0,"I feel guilt if I use mine in front of him. I don't watch TV, but I do use my smartphone. Honestly, I think I use it a bit too much in front of him. 

I do wear him a lot, play with him, drop everything if he cries and give him attention right away, and I lie down with him for his naps(he naps best that way - doesn't nap well in carrier) and he sleeps in bed with me at night. (However, at bed time after he has been asleep for half an hour or so, I sneak away for a few hours to catch up on chores/meal preps/shower/brush teeth/etc. He won't let me do this during the day btw, he is a light sleeper for his naps and requires me next to him. I love the snuggles, though.)

So yeah, I do give him attention, but I do feel guilty when I pull out and play around on my phone in front of him. I'm worried about hindering his emotional development. 

Really, I think my phone usage has been happening more in front of him, because I don't get much ""alone time"" where I can mentally recharge my batteries. Husband works a lot, so I pretty much don't get time to myself except for part of one day a week. Also, been fairly sleep deprived lately, so I tend to be more easily distracted. (Not an excuse)

Ugh...I feel so much guilt. I wish I could give my baby boy my full attention 100% of the time. I worry he feels sad inside when he sees mommy using her phone sometimes. :(

I definitely want to cut out phone time in front of my boy. I need to balance how I spend my time better. 

Any other mommas with phone guilt? Do you use your phone too much? Are we being too hard on ourselves?

10 month old waking constantly and on the move!,AttachmentParenting,6,7e15uc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/7e15uc/10_month_old_waking_constantly_and_on_the_move/,5,1511133626.0,"Hi guys. So bed sharing has worked out well, until the last couple nights. I've got some non-fluffy firm pillows blocking one side of the king bed, most of the bottom edge, and a light blanket covering me from my waist down tucked around me like a burrito. I wear layers and doubled wool socks to stay warm as I get really cold at night. Only thing is that the blanket doesn't stay completely tucked around my feet and bunches up at the bottom a bit. This caused zero issues until last night. I woke up with little man head first laying down there at the bottom of the bed on the bunched blankets and was a bit freaked out. So I ditched the blanket. Then about an hour or so later, I wake up to a thunk and a cranky baby who managed to craw over the pillow wall and off the bed (matress on the floor). Between him being awake every half hour or so and me feeling very uncomfortable without my blanket, we ended up just getting up almost 3 hours early. 

What gives? Our bedroom is at 72 degrees, little man is in a cozy fleece sleeper, bed times are solid, foods don't seem to be giving him issues, he's got a clear bill of health per doctor, I stay home with him and he gets plenty of love from daddy and grandma too. 

I thought the waking up to nurse a billion times a night was something I was just going to have to deal with for a while, (as no non-crying method has slowed that down), but now I'm starting to get concerned. What do I do about a baby who wakes often and is constantly on the move and prevents me from having a blanket (which I can't sleep without)? Also the bedroom is 90% baby proofed, except for a wall heater that makes me a little nervous. "

She high fived the carer goodbye though, and didn't protest when I said we'd do the same again. Tomorrow, so I thought, ok, not terrible. But she woke up early this morning, so I figured I'd take her to daycare earlier and pick her up earlier too so she wouldn't get too tired while at daycare. Turns out I'm an idiot because while the centre does open earlier, the carer that my LO is used to didn't start any earlier, so we hung out and played for half an hour or so, waiting for this carer (I figured that was better than leaving and coming back later with her) but after that, by the time the carer got there, bub was already ready for a nap  :( (and so incredibly cranky/upset) so I popped her in the car again, figuring leaving her in daycare in that condition would be a purely negative experience for everyone involved, and she slept for an hour in the car.

Side note; she's only having a nap roughly 3 days a week at the moment, sometimes a long boring car ride is the only way to get that to happen...

So she woke up in a cranky mood still. Fed her something again and she seemed happier. I'm planning to take her back to daycare and leave her for half an hour in the afternoon, to help her get used to it, but I just... ugh! It's never easy with this kid! I see other babies and toddlers and they're just so chill and mine, while she's a terrific kid, she's always been so so so so much work. With the not sleeping at night and the constant breastfeeding and feeling like she's been attached to me forever, not being able to leave the room without her screaming, the co-sleeping. I don't mind any of it, but just once I'd like it to be easy and for her to not need me so much. Just for today. I know long days and short years and all that. I'm trying so hard to fulfil her needs (not her wants) so she can feel safe and grow her independence... but I just wish it was easier than it is. I don't know why I'm posting this.

First time in daycare,AttachmentParenting,6,7anp50,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/7anp50/first_time_in_daycare/,6,1509785947.0,"Hi!

So on Monday, our terrific 2 year old will be going into daycare for the first time ever 😱  and I would love any tips you lovely folks might have.

She's been babysat before for up to 6 hours by relatives. She's been fine with that (shorter at first, then working up to longer periods of leaving her) And we've had 'play dates' at the daycare she's going to for 4 weeks now (so about 8 play dates) where I (or hubs) take her and we just play or she goes and does her thing with me there, so she can get used to the carers and other kids.

So far she's really enjoyed being with the other kids and participating in the sensory play and craft activities they've got available. So it's a positive association she's developed. But we really are anticipating quite a bit of separation anxiety.

The same 2 carers are on every day that she'll be there (2 days a week), and the way they deal with crying is to validate their feelings, then distract, which is how we want it to be done. 

The carer:child ratio is 1:4

I'll be picking her up after just a couple of hours for the first few weeks before she does a full day, and I am available to pick her up at any time if she's just too distressed. The centre is going to call me at regular intervals to check in. And they'll call me to come and get her if she's just too upset (she vomits if she gets worked up- she's a sensitive little bug...)

She's chosen a bag and lunchbox and water bottle that she loves! And we're going to pack them together before I drop her off.

She doesn't have a comforter, despite our repeated and continual efforts :( but we've got a picture of us 3 that she can carry around (when either of us aren't with her, she sometimes likes to look at photos).

We intend to keep the goodbyes brief.

I've been reading her lots of books about first days at daycares/ nurseries/schools, and explaining what's going to happen.

If anyone has any wisdom on how to make it any easier, I would be very grateful! "
How to deal with separation anxiety,AttachmentParenting,9,7am4ks,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/7am4ks/how_to_deal_with_separation_anxiety/,6,1509769886.0,"In 10 days I'll have to spend 24h at the hospital in order to have a renal biopsy done. I'm really panicking, I've never been away from my 9 month old for more than 2 hours. We've also sort of been doing attachement parenting - I bedshare and she needs to nurse in order to fall asleep. She still wakes up a couple of times a night and nurses back to sleep. She doesn't take a bottle but she takes a sippy cup with water.

What should I do so that she isn't too traumatised by my absence ? I'm afraid she'll spend the 24 hours crying and not eating anything. For naps she sometimes falls asleep in the baby carrier but at night time she needs to nurse back to sleep. She'll be at home with her dad and grandma during my absence, she's used to them but she spends most of her time with me. Also, babies aren't allowed to visit and I'll be on bedrest at the hospital, so seeing her won't be a possibility.

One year old will only settle for mum,AttachmentParenting,6,75ixei,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/75ixei/one_year_old_will_only_settle_for_mum/,10,1507687799.0,"Help! During the couple of months when DD would have been building up sleep associations, her dad would mostly get home after she was asleep. Now, she will only go to sleep for me (mum). When she wakes in the night, she will only settle for me.

It's gotten so bad that sometimes she semi wakes, sits up in bed and I just have to go in and gently lie her back down. If her dad tries to do this, the minute he comes in and she senses in her half asleep state that it's not me, she screams, like really panic screams, until I come in. I've been out at the supermarket before, she woke up and it took me 10 min to get home... She was beside herself, in her Dads arms.

Aside from sleep time, she adores her daddy and has a very close relationship with him.

What do we do!!! Not only does this mean I can never be away from her at sleep time or even go out after she's asleep, but I'm terrified if something happens and I have to spend a night away like in hospital or something.

Edit: I breast feed, but don't feed to sleep - she has a pacifier. Also, she goes to daycare and sleeps fine for the teacher there. "
Might need to give up breastfeeding. Crushed - need support,AttachmentParenting,15,74sp1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/74sp1r/might_need_to_give_up_breastfeeding_crushed_need/,18,1507376904.0,"*sorry that this post is a bit all over the place*

I'm extremely sad at the thought I might have to stop breastfeeding.

My son has had many problems with allergies, and we have been working with his GI and pediatrician. 

He can't have dairy, soy, or peanuts(breastmilk). I also don't eat meat or eggs. My diet has been quite limited, but we've been managing.

However, now the pediatrician thinks he actually might be allergic to legumes, too.  That's mainly how I get my protein. If we have to cut out legumes, I won't have an adequate diet.

My supply has dwindled so much, from the having to take so many breaks from breastfeeding since it makes my son so sick, even though I have regular pumping sessions + power pumping sessions every day, it just isn't enough. He is on a special hypoallergenic formula because that's the only thing he doesn't have a bad reaction to. 

I feel so sad about not letting him have my breast. I'm afraid I'll hurt him emotionally in a permanent way by not breastfeeding, and it is hurting me emotionally too. 

I have breastmilk stored in the freezer, in hopes that I can give it to him if he grows out of his allergies, but his pediatrician said that might not happen and I might have to throw it out. Which also just sucks. 

Sorry if this is all a bit overdramatic, it[breastfeeding] just really means a lot to me.  My goal was to make it to at least one year breastfeeding, we've only reached half that. 

I would like ideas of alternative ways on how to offer the physical/emotional comfort a baby needs, from moms who can't/choose not to breastfeed. And also reassurance that he will be okay. I know I'm probably worrying too much, because many moms don't breastfeed and end up with happy babies. 

Thanks for reading this all-over-the-place post, I'm so glad to be a part of this group. <3

Play time - what do you do?,AttachmentParenting,10,72y08f,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/72y08f/play_time_what_do_you_do/,16,1506603992.0,"Hello, so nice to find this subreddit.

I'm doing attachment parenting with my baby, who is 6 months old.

I'm confused about what play time should be like, and how to do it, so that it is in line with attachment parenting.

Here are some things we do for play time:
He LOVES walks while in the carrier, and I go around showing him different things outside. 

He enjoys sitting in my lap while I read him books. 

He loves songs and ""dancing"" while I hold him and help him ""do the motions."" 

He likes sitting in my lap and playing with toys. 

However, he doesn't like playing ""alone."" (Me being near him and interacting, but not holding him.) 

He will play with toys for at most 5 minutes,  and then he begins to get visibly anxious and restless, and by 10 minutes he starts crying.

I feel really bad when this happens, and think, at this age should I just he holding him for play time? He doesn't even seem interested in trying to crawl and explore. He seems to get overwhelmed easily.

I'm totally fine if he needs to be held for play time, I just don't know if that is what attachment parents usually do, and if it is normal for him to be like this. (Not that I expect him to be ""normal"" - every baby is different!) 

Would like to hear others thoughts on playtime. "
Introducing the idea of a sibling to toddler with a doll...lots of tears?!,AttachmentParenting,12,72g1md,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/72g1md/introducing_the_idea_of_a_sibling_to_toddler_with/,4,1506407489.0,"***Crosspost***


So me and my partner are expecting and we have an 18 month old son already getting grown in the house. We decided it would be a good idea to start introducing him to the idea of a sibling by buying him a doll that we could play with as if it were a real baby. First day we did this our son just burst into emotional tears when we did simple things like put the baby to sleep or give the baby a hug. The next day, even without playing with the doll, I would notice him bursting into the same type of tears while doing other activities. This behavior didn't stop until I put the doll out of sight. We recently re-introduced the doll and tears started again!
My questions are, how normal is this kind of behavior and are we doing the right thing by introducing a sibling like this? My intuition is that maybe he's just creeped out and scared of the doll, he seems to small to be jealous of it. But not sure. Anyone with similar experiences or advice?"
Nighttime nursing,AttachmentParenting,4,719ed7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/719ed7/nighttime_nursing/,8,1505919878.0,"I was wondering if anyone here has any suggestions for us?

My daughter is nine and a half months old, we have been co - sleeping pretty much since she was born. This week she has been waking for feeds almost every hour. I've tried holding and rocking her instead of feeding but she just screams until I give in ( last night I lasted nearly an hour before I caved )

I'm reluctant to try some kind of cry - it - out method, mainly because I just don't see her ever self - settling? We went on holiday in the summer and she hates the car seat so she screamed for two straight hours without pause. I don't really want to leave her to scream herself to sleep but I also have trouble believing that she would stop before I give in :-(

I tried feeding her to sleep and then putting her down mut the second her back touches her bed we're back to the screaming. Same with naps. 

I'd really like to get some kind of control over her night waking and the amount she naps during the day but I'm at a loss for how to start. Every other baby this age we know has been in their own beds for at least six - hour stretches for months by now. I can't help thinking that we must be doing something wrong. She has been kind of indulged with the feeding on demand and I'm worried she's going to end up spoilt. We're first time parents and I don't know what the hell I'm doing (if you couldn't tell already ;-) )

Sorry for the essay!"
"How I got my extremely attached 9 month old to take solo naps in his crib, with no tears.",AttachmentParenting,16,6yyf5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/6yyf5s/how_i_got_my_extremely_attached_9_month_old_to/,5,1504942145.0,"Well I'm having a fantastic day because months of figuring out how to do this with no real idea where to start has finally paid off!

To begin, my son has never wanted to nap or sleep on his own.  Ever since about 2-3 months, he completely refused to nap without me holding him.  We also started bedsharing at 3 months. I loved the cuddles, but I couldn't get anything done and I was going a little crazy from being stuck on the couch for hours every day.  I've seen others ask how to accomplish this, so I figured I would share what worked for us.  It took us 6 months to achieve this, but knowing what I know now, I think I could have accomplished it in 1-2 months. 

Starting out, I determined a schedule for when he took naps.  This was led by him.  I started noticing he would get tired about 2 hours after waking in the morning and again two hours after each nap.  So I paid close attention around those times for signs of sleepiness (yawning, fussiness).  We also, mostly, got our feeding schedule in line with nap time.  We feed on demand, so it didn't always line up at first, but it normally does now.  

Previously, he would only stay asleep if he was latched.  So I started working on introducing a pacifier.  He finally took one at around 6 months.  I would nurse him until drowsy then gently substitute the paci.  This would wake him, so I'd rock him back to sleep.  

The next step involved getting him used to being laid down.  I introduced calming music and a stuffed animal for a lovey at this stage. So, I'd nurse him until he was drowsy, stick in the paci, rock him until he was drowsy again, lay him down in bed (no pillows or blankets on the bed and I checked on him constantly just in case), then lay beside him, and cuddle him to sleep.  Once this became routine, I started inching away after about 15 minutes (when I could tell he was definitely asleep). We spent months on this stage because he went through a cold and several teeth, which set us back to being held for naps.  

When he learned to crawl last month, I switched to putting his crib mattress on the floor and cuddling him to sleep there.  Then I started laying him down, fully asleep, and sitting beside him so that my leg was touching him, but not cuddling him.  I noticed he wasn't really waking when I did this, so then I started laying him down, once asleep, and backing away.   No cuddles, no sitting beside him.  That worked a few times, so today I got brace enough to stick the mattress in the crib and laid him in it once he was fully asleep.  He stayed asleep!!!  And there were no tears in this whole process. 

Some extra pieces of info -- He will take naps ranging from 20 min to 1 hour on his own at this point. He will nap up to 3 hours in the afternoon if held, but we're just going to take what we can get with nap length.  Also, I've tried creating a longer routine by reading a book before nursing, but he just gets mad because he knows it's time for food and sleep.  

Knowing what I know now, this is how I would have done things (on mobile, sorry about formatting):

1. Establish a nap time routine including time of day, paci, lovey, music, book, nursing, rocking, etc. 

2. Once routine is established, begin laying him down on crib mattress, on the floor, and lay with him during naps.  

3. Once #2 is established, start scooting away after he is asleep. 

4. Once #3 is established, lay him down and sit next to him instead of cuddling.

5. Once #4 is established, lay him down, no cuddles or sitting (unless he wakes). 

6.  Move mattress to crib and lay him down there. 

Now we're going to start trying this at night, but I don't expect to fully transition from bedsharing for quite some time.  


TL;DR - Got LO to transition from being held for naps, to solo naps in crib, using a no cry approach that involved music, a pacifier, a lovey, rocking/nursing to sleep, and gradual weaning of cuddling on his mattress on the floor. Culminating in a successful nap in his crib.

1 year old won't nurse to sleep anymore- anyone else?,AttachmentParenting,8,6yj0c0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/6yj0c0/1_year_old_wont_nurse_to_sleep_anymore_anyone_else/,9,1504765476.0,"My daughter turns 1 on the 12th. We bedshare, and I would love to nurse to sleep. She has always had a hard time falling asleep, especially at bedtime (regardless of awake time before, clock time, longer routine, etc). Currently we usually start bedtime routine about 7:30, which involves dinner, bath, diaper/PJs, book, ""good night house"" then nursing to sleep in the bedroom (dark with a fan for noise). She still takes two naps, although recently she seems like she's starting the transition to 1 nap. She generally sleeps 2.5-3 hours in the day and 10-11.5 hours at night (with about 4 wakeups, although I've been spacing out night feeds for 2 months).

Increasingly over the last few months, she won't nurse to sleep. She can be on the boob 20 minutes and will be drowsy, but awake. When she was 9-10 months we could easily lay her down next to us and cradle her with an arm, and she would drift off (talking, quiet, or some whining). Lately, though, especially as she has gotten more mobile, she wants to flip onto her stomach to crawl and will freak out if we try to keep her cradled.

So I said okay, maybe if I just lay in bed and let her crawl around, eventually she'll just flop out. I've tried this for over a week now, and she can go 60+ minutes without falling asleep. It just ends with me repositioning her next to me and basically having to hold her still on her back anyway (and she falls asleep, but isn't pleased, and I don't like doing it). 

I love bedsharing, I love it when she nurses to sleep, and I won't CIO. But I'm honestly wondering if putting her in a crib and camping out while she flops around or cries to be picked up is the only way to deal with this. Except she's already so old, it just feels like going backwards and I know she would get upset being separated; she's been in a raised cosleeper next to our bed but never a crib.

Am I the only person whose kid won't nurse to sleep?"

My breastfeeding story,AttachmentParenting,21,6p07hy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/6p07hy/my_breastfeeding_story/,4,1500825304.0,"I have been wanting to post this for a long time to give some encouragement to new breastfeeding moms. I know I would have loved to have something like this when our journey began. 

My son was born in September 2015. I wanted to avoid all drugs but after a day of labor I got the epidural. I have no regrets! It enabled me to have a birthing experience that I will remember pleasantly forever. However I do suspect that the effects of the epidural might have had an effect on that first latch. 

In the weeks leading up to his birth I learned a lot about nursing... Kaiser makes a big deal about it every step of the way including showing videos of newborn babies crawling to the breast and nursing. I couldn't wait! 

Except that didn't happen at all. In fact my baby seemed to hate my breasts. Every time I would try to nurse him he would scream and turn his face away. I tried expressing a little and letting him smell/taste. Every nurse tried to force him onto my breast with each visit. The in-house ""lactation consultant"" did a lot of the same crap. It was awful having a different stranger every hour smush my breast with one gloved hand and grab the screaming baby's head with the other and try to force it to eat. Luckily one nurse took pity on me and showed me how to squeeze colostrum onto a spoon and feed it to him. 

I just knew that once I left the hospital and all these interfering hands that baby and I would get the hang of it. 

It took almost a week before he could nurse at all. We were getting good at spoon feeding colostrum and I also gave in to the pressure of them weighing him daily so supplemented with some formula. He was a TERRIBLE nurser. His mouth was so tiny and oddly shaped that his latch pinched me in the worst way. I wanted to cry any time someone said ""I think he's hungry!""

While he slowly got the hang of it, my nipples took a beating. I visited a lactation center where I was given some nipple shields. They were annoying to use but we only needed them for a few weeks while I healed. Once his head grew his mouth evened out which helped a LOT. 

After these growing pains, my son became the best nurser! We could nurse in the baby carrier at Disneyland. We could nurse while I cooked dinner. We could nurse to sleep and to bond. It was lovely. He would take a pacifier or bottle from dad and Nana no problem. 

There have been other slightly unpleasant nursing phases like fiddling and pinching, a little biting, but mostly it's been great. We are slowly starting to wean. He calls them ""beebees"" now (basically boobies but so cute how he says it!) and pulls down my shirt so we have to put a stop to that. I'm going to miss this time in our lives, it was so beautiful and difficult and I'm proud of us for overcoming it. 

I hope this helps someone else who comes across it. Would love to hear your story too, and have them stored in this thread for new moms. I respect the choose to breastfeed or not to, so if you went the bottle route, don't be shy! Thanks for reading.

We thought he was showing signs of being ready in that he was frequently taking long (aprox 2 hour) naps and resisting 3rd nap. I usually breastfeed to sleep and cosleep. 

Dropping to 2 longer naps backfired nastily though. He started waking up half an hour into night sleep (7pm start) and showing no interest in sleep for around 2 hours (staying up from 7.30 to 9.30). So we worked out he was essentially using bedtime to give himself a 3rd nap! We persisted, perhaps foolishly, for a few days to see if it was just an adjustment thing but nope he did this every time he didnt get a third nap. Even though he was essentially getting the same amount of sleep just split in 2 not 3.

Soooo we're back to 3 naps and third nap resistance. Sigh. And I've stopped cosleeping for naps so that he doesn't get too much day sleep. 

Bring on 2 nap readiness! Any similar stories or advice out there?"

Wakes the same number of times but goes almost straight back to sleep without boob. There's been a few grumbles but no tears. Then a reeeeeaaaallly big breastfeed in the mornings! We're doing this a few nights a week. Just so dad doesn't become too sleep deprived. We started because my back is killing me because she won't leave me alone at night time, essentially wrapping around my neck... I needed a break and dad volunteered. It's going great! She understands what's going on. This is a great age. I feel like this is essentially night weaning and I'm so glad that it's actually EASY.

Breastfed toddler not eating,AttachmentParenting,5,6iqlz0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/6iqlz0/breastfed_toddler_not_eating/,9,1498127010.0,"Hello! I'm not sure the best place to ask this, but I know there are like minded people in this sub.

So my almost 2 year old has always been a boobie monster. We still feed to sleep for naps and throughout the night. (Although at night its more of a permanent latch with no sucking going on, and if I spend most of the night away from her my boobs don't fill up so I don't think she's actually feeding throughout the night)

And she used to be such a glutton for all food. But not anymore. I know all toddlers become fussy and that's perfectly normal. But unless it's meat or cheese, my girl won't touch it. I always always always offer fruit and veg with every meal, but if there's no meat or cheese, she simply doesn't eat anything. 

I know she gets the vast majority of her nutrition and calories from breastmilk. And she's trending upwards towards the 97th percentile for weight so weight gain is not an issue! Except maybe considering overweight ness...

Sometimes I'll offer her food or water and she'll refuse and ask for milk instead. 

I guess I just want to gain perspective on our situation- is it normal? This has been going on for 4 months or so now so if it's a phase it's a bloody long one..."
Going to sleep issues,AttachmentParenting,5,6i9dbz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/6i9dbz/going_to_sleep_issues/,5,1497935052.0,"So my little one goes through stages where she's easier to get to sleep than others. When she's not going through something major, I try to get her to go to sleep in her own bed - i.e. putting her down while drowsy but awake. At the moment, she will calmly be in there, sometimes lies down while I snuggle into her as best I can over the sides of the cot, or she'll flip over and crawl around a bit, gets floppy as she gets more tired, reaches out to me a lot...but doesn't sleep. Then she'll just start to lose it, and I pick her up to cuddle her and eventually have to nurse her to sleep because she's so past it.

Even though she's not crying, she's clearly fighting sleep because I'm not holding her. And just when I think oh she's ok, she reaches out to me....so is she actually ok, or is she spending the whole time desperately wanting to be picked up or get to me? I would feel terrible if that were the case.

On the one hand I question why I bother with trying to put her down when she'd rather fall asleep in my arms, on the other hand I kind of feel that at 8 months, I could be creating a dependency ...true or not?

But anywhere near a pool or the beach, he clings to me and screams in a different way than normal. I don't know what would be worse, letting him be afraid and stay away from water, or bringing him into the water despite his terror. 

With my older step sons, when they were little I let them do their own thing as far as what they were comfortable with, and they have turned out all right if not very active. 

I'm worried that if I let my 17 month old avoid water then he could do so for a long time and miss out on fun with other kids.

What I'm definitely NOT loving is her insistence on being on top of me. Up until a few weeks ago I could roll over and sleep on my stomach until she needed resettling again, but now she will not sleep unless she gets boob while being draped over my neck and chest like some kind of 12kg scarf... it's incredibly uncomfortable and adds to the feeling of me not owning my body and the sleep deprivation.

Husband does as much of the night duties as possible while I go sleep in another room but it's so much more work for him and it means the toddler gets less sleep and is cranky during the day for me (I'm a SAHM).
Husband suggested night weaning but I don't think he's aware of how much work will be involved for him if we tried to night wean her (previously high needs baby, currently boobie monster although less high needs)

I have a 5 y/o boy and a 3 month old girl. I started cosleeping with DD from about two weeks- sleep at night is great so far, we both sleep very well. However, during the day I cannot get her to nap unless I'm holding her (and rocking and usually nursing). I realize this is due to nighttime cosleeping and probably her age. The biggest issue with this is that my son is left to play on his tablet so I can get her to nap. He of course doesn't mind at all- he loves tablet time, but I feel SO guilty about it- like a am neglecting him. If I try to just have him play in his room with toys alone he comes and talks to me every couple minutes- not the best when trying to get DD to sleep. I've tried babywearing but she typically does not sleep well in it and I have a bad shoulder so it becomes painful. The only time she falls asleep independently is on a car ride. Idk this just turned in to a rant. I'm just feeling crappy lately about not being able to play with my son when baby naps. Obviously something needs to change but I'm not sure how to go about it.

My husband and I are following an attachment parenting style for the most part (we co-sleep and she's exclusively breastfed), but at least twice a day (morning and late afternoon) she'll only fall asleep in her car seat. I'll try nursing her to sleep (but I have an over-active letdown, which makes nursing frustrating for her when she's tired), rocking her, and walking around/bouncing, but she continues to cry inconsolably until I put her in her car seat and we run errands. At that point, she'll cry for a few minutes and then fall asleep for a two hour nap. 

I'm worried that she's only falling asleep in the car seat because she feels abandoned and finally just gives up (like in the cry-it-out method), but I don't know what else to do. I'm glad she's getting sleep - I think she gets over tired, and that's why she can't fall asleep any other way. But I feel  guilty while she's asleep in her car seat. I'm worried that I'm messing her up psychologically or something. 

I'd prefer baby wearing, but have yet to find a baby wearing style she enjoys - she either cries or moans and groans while I'm wearing her, and won't fall asleep.

I slept great and felt so refreshed.

 Now it's gone backwards. Baby is 7 months and for the past 6 weeks has needed my nipple more and more and more.

Refuses pacifier and if I try to hide my breast or move away baby immediately wakes and cries. I loved bedsharing but now I am just completely exhausted. I hardly have the energy to play in the day. I will not let baby cry. We don't have a crib but tried a large bassinet and after 45 minutes baby wakes up crying and looking terrified and I don't want that.

Some background, we tried to get pregnant for 5 years through fertility treatments and finally did.

SO.

I should mention that we will be transitioning him into his own room in the next couple months, once weve moved to a bigger place, but that will be after I go back to work.

Everyone comments on how sweet and well behaved she is. Lately, however, bedtime has turned into a very drawn out battle usually ending in me threatening some sort of non attachment parenting style punishment and her waking up her baby sister calling and screaming for me the second I get down stairs. I think it all started with a normal and genuine fear of being alone in her room at night but we have gotten her all the night lights/princess decals for her walls/noise machines/long talks about her fears and she doesn't seem scared like she was before. I think she just realised if she screams for us loud enough we will come spend more time with her so she won't wake up her sister(she's 1). She doesn't seem to care if it is positive time or not. I am honestly at a loss. If I offer a gentle solution to the reason she says she can't sleep she comes up with another problem and then shoots down all the solutions I come up with again. Everything that works for her in the day time does not at night anymore. She doesn't want me to help her sleep she wants to stay awake and be with us no matter the costs. We have a bedtime routine. I make sure to spend time with her during the day. I don't know what to do at this point. Every night I feel so guilty and think maybe I am not being understanding as she is only 4,but I also feel very strongly that she isn't scared and is just trying to buy more time before bed. Mama is tired and just needs at least an hour to pick up and sit down before I go to sleep myself. Any advice? Is this a phase? Should I kiss my nightly hour of solitude goodbye and just help her through it? Or should I put my foot down and be stern? "

Another question is how do I cope with the loss of nursing? So natural to me that I usually just pull out the boob without thinking about it. And I am going to miss it!

Right now, he's mostly cool with me cosleeping with our son because he knows that's the only way I'm going to get any sleep, but he's constantly encouraging me to try some new tactic to get our son to sleep in his crib. Left to his own devices, my husband would have already implemented CIO. *Ugh*  

I'm posting because I'm concerned about the resistance I'm going to face in the future for wanting to continue cosleeping until my son is ready for his own bed.  I'm also weary from always having to defend myself, never being taken seriously, and never being around others who share my parenting philosophies.  It also sucks that my husband and I aren't on the same page, I wish we were. 

I am very educated on child development, cosleeping, and to some degree, attachment parenting. Before I quit my job to become a SAHM, I was an early childhood health and safety specialist who worked with daycares and preschools through a government sponsored program.  Plus, I am an early childhood dietitian, for what that's worth.  I can share facts and statistics until I am blue in the face, and none of it matters to my husband because ""studies can be made to show anything researchers want.""  My husband is not stupid, but he is ingrained in the status quo parenting methods around here and he's stubborn.  

In addition, though they are not very vocal about it, I know that both my parents and my inlaws don't agree with cosleeping or attachment parenting.  I also anticipate future resistance, especially if my husband starts making comments about what he sees as me spoiling our child.  

My main question is how to deal with my husband and family on the topic of cosleeping, specifically?  I kind of hate phrasing it that way, but the alternative is me not sleeping or CIO and I'm not doing either one of those.  

I also would appreciate any encouragement you all can send my way.  I know I'm not spoiling my child, but I've heard it enough that it's hard to keep doubts from creeping in.  

TL;DR - My husband and our families don't agree with me cosleeping long term (at least until our son is ok with sleeping in his own bed) and I'd like encouragement and advice on how to deal with resistance. "

My 20-month-old wakes up ALL. THE. TIME.,AttachmentParenting,15,5z7xpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/5z7xpr/my_20monthold_wakes_up_all_the_time/,10,1489469799.0,"Hello fellow attachment-parentes of Reddit!

I'm a 30-year-old mom. I've got a five-and-a-half year-old, amazing little girl who is incredibly smart, caring and resilient! So, AP pays off in the end!

However, I'm feeling pretty frustrated and discouraged right now with my 20-month-old son's sleeping habits. We co-sleep and breastfeed on demand, so I'm used to him waking up at night, but for the past four weeks or so he has turned it up like a million notches. 

He will wake up REALLY upset, and demand ""booboos"". But Even booboos will rarely settle him. He usually flails around and cries and takes forever to settle. I try rubbing his belly, cuddling him, holding his hand, and he usually pushes me away or just holds my hand and plays with my fingers until he drifts off.

This is hard for me because I am, and always have been, a really light sleeper. Plus I have the tiniest bladder in the world so I'm also up peeing quite a lot. So adding his nighttime shenanigans to this and I'm feeling like the walking dead.

I think he might be teething? He keeps reaching his fingers back in his mouth...but I can't see/feel anything.

I tried sleeping in a different bed last night for part of the night, thinking perhaps I was tossing and turning and waking him. Sadly, this was not the case and he was the same. Twice last night I did something I have never done before -- I was just so tired and nothing was calming him so I just rolled over and tried to go back to sleep. After a few minutes, he fell back to sleep. But he kept waking up.

Seriously, he slept better as a newborn. This is making me start to resent breastfeeding, which is sad. I nursed my daughter until she was three and a half and I want to nurse my son until at least two years old, but it's getting REALLY hard."

I didn't choose attachment parenting - he did, and it worked for us great so far. My problem is he still only sleeps in my arms or while nursing in my bed. He will only sleep while he feels me near. If I try to sneak out, he'll be awake in 2 minutes. 
While he's awake, he's a happy child, we lough a lot, he plays on his own for up to half an hour or with his brother. He's not a great eater, very hands on with his food, but not much of it gets actually eaten. I'm not too worried yet, since he has a lot of energy and he is quite big for his age.
Did you have this experience and were you able to get him to sleep on his own at some point? Is there some gentle transition that worked?

4 month old only napping 45 mins tops,AttachmentParenting,4,5ujzj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/5ujzj4/4_month_old_only_napping_45_mins_tops/,14,1487331260.0,"Hi hi! First time poster here. I'm a FTM and I exclusively breastfeed and co-sleep. My almost-4 month old is a pretty phenomenal sleeper, most of the time (well, ever since I got the hint that fighting him sleeping in a bassinet away from me was futile and to embrace bed sharing), but having him nap solo has been a bit of a challenge. At night he could literally sleep 12 hours with me in the bed, but naps are a different story. I used to let him just nap on me throughout the day (which I still do for his one longer afternoon nap), but I found my house was falling apart and I was getting absolutely nothing done by having him nap on me throughout the day. So now, about an hour-2 hours after he wakes up in the morning I nurse him, rock him for anywhere from 2 to 10 minutes and transfer him to the dock-a-tot. There he'll sleep happily - but for 45 mins on the dot, every time. And we do this up to 3 times throughout the day / afternoon, until he gets so cranky he falls asleep on me for 1.5-3 hours. Am I doing something wrong? Should I be letting him fuss more when he wakes up at the 45 minute mark? Do babies actually wake up, fuss, and then fall back to sleep? I've read that a baby's sleep cycle is about 60 mins long.. but that they can wake/soothe/go back to sleep. Should they?? Do they? I'm definitely not down for CIO, but will he naturally learn to sleep longer? Does anybody have experience with a baby who only sleeps for short times and then eventually naps longer? Any tips or strategies that worked for you would be great.

She's been falling asleep later at night too.
Her singular day nap has been creeping earlier and earlier too, which is what happened when she went from 2naps to 1. But she's still napping for 40 mins+ resettling then for another hour or so.

What do you guys think-is she getting ready to drop the nap entirely? Is it a wonder week thing? Is she growing? Should I put it down to teething? Ugh."

However, she has started being quite rough with me lately.

During breastfeeding, she likes to grab/pinch/poke/hit my face, and finds it hilarious when I ask her to stop; and gets upset when I hold up a hand in front of my eyes to defend myself. She's just really enthusiastic, and doesn't understand what is wrong.

At other times, she also likes to grab my face, stare right into my eyes and say 'I love you'.

This is absolutely lovely, aside from when she pinches and twists my cheeks or gouges my eyes to try and get a good grip. 

I know that she's just a little excitable, and when she is being rough it's just misdirected enthusiasm. 

I have tried showing her what she should do instead by asking her to stroke gently or use 'gentle hands' with mixed results; but she is starting to get strong enough to draw blood, and I don't want to squash the innate kindness and enthusiasm that is its root cause.

A couple of times I have reflexively yelped in pain, which has caused her to burst into tears. There's obviously no malice in her behaviour - but something needs to change. Preferably in a way that respects both her and me!

But I’m less clear on where the line is/should be as far as fussing and squawking.

I came into this prepared to respond as quickly as possible to the first sign of fussiness. BUT I’ve noticed that my baby (almost 5 weeks) actually seems *more distressed* if I disturb her at certain times. This happens mostly when she is sleeping a longer interval - when I think she is connecting sleep cycles? She will fuss or let out single (not sustained) cries a bit with her eyes still mostly closed, and I’ve noticed that when I can’t get to her right away (I talk to her letting her know I’m coming), when I do get to her side ready to pick her up, she is back to sleeping soundly. However, if I pick her up at these times, she starts fussing more strongly and actually crying. 

I'm learning that this response is different from her other type of fussiness – if her eyes are open, then she calms down immediately when picked up almost 100% of the time.

My instinct is to try to follow her cues as far as eyes open vs. closed, but I also want her to learn that someone is there to respond to her needs, and in some ways this does seem similar to CIO ""extinction"" techniques. Is this normal? Am I overthinking this, or should I be responding to every fuss regardless?

tl;dr: My son wont sleep without physically touching me, and when he's awake, I have to be right next to him and more often than not actively engaging with him - otherwise he cries.  

 -  

My son will be a year next month.  We co-sleep/bed share (don't own a crib at all), baby wear, breastfeed (no bottles - he wont take them), do baby led weaning, the whole nine yards.  

He's been mildly sick off and on most of the winter and has been teething for the last month - with two finally cutting through in the past week.  But it just seems that over the last month or two he's gotten SO much more attached to me.  I almost always nurse him to sleep, unless we're in the car or babywearing and previously I could nurse him and then sneak out of the room where he's sleep for anywhere from 40 min to 2 hours undisturbed.  For shorter naps, I could go back, nurse again, and slip out again with little fuss.  At night, it would be the same... I'd nurse him to sleep around 8-9 and he'd sleep peacefully until 10-12 when we'd come to bed, then he'd stir from us entering, and nurse right back.  He'd wake frequently in the night and nurse 3-5x before getting up around 8-9am. 

Now though, the second I slide away from him he starts to stir and he's up crying within minutes (if not seconds) of my leaving.  He's also taken to latching on ALL night long and during the day he's much more attached to me than he used to be.  Previously I could work on my computer for short stints while he played next to me, I could go to the bathroom and he wouldn't notice except to smile at my return... Is this just a phase we need to stick out? Is there something I can do to help him be at least a tiny bit more self sustaining than he has become? I am not emotionally capable of doing ""cry it out"" and I realize there's no magic overnight fix... just looking for some advice beyond ""Yep - you screqed your kid up bad"" which is about all I've heard from other parenting resources.

We cosleep, have a pretty decent bedtime routine, and she's breastfed to sleep. I try to be patient, consistent and firm (the yelling in the title is all in my head!) but I'd love any other ideas or tips for what I'm hoping is just a phase. Can't ask friends or family: too many cry-it-outers!!"
Dental care for 1yo? (enamel hypoplasia),AttachmentParenting,7,5arr2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/5arr2g/dental_care_for_1yo_enamel_hypoplasia/,11,1478141459.0,"TLDR: weak tooth enamel > cavity on front tooth > chipping/disintegrating tooth over the course of three weeks (waiting to hear back about appt at specialty kids dentist).  Have you experienced this? How did it go? Have been told there's not a lot to do with kids under 3?!

Please share your dental adventures with very young toddlers.

We're on the crunchy end of the spectrum over here in our parenting adventure, just to get that out of the way.

Generally we opt for less invasive and/or natural options for ourselves and baby so long as it's not an emergency. It has served us well this far.

My son has what I believe to be enamel hypoplasia. We noticed a brown spot on an upper tooth three weeks ago. I got into a regular dentist right away who said it looks like weakened enamel, nothing we could have done, it just happens sometimes. He told us to watch and wait and if he seems bothered by it, see a kids specific dentist for options.

Yesterday we noticed his tooth is now chipping! I'm not taking it as gospel by any means, but I purchased and completely read Cure Tooth Decay last night. This is in line with our own personal experiences of using nutrition to correct chronic conditions in ourselves in the past (we're Primal/Paleo about 85%, it has been life changing for us, so it's not up for debate). However, it's my baby's mouth we're dealing with here... I'm waiting to hear back from the pediatric dentist right now for an appointment.

I know I'm absolutely opposed to general anesthesia on my little guy at this age, so I guess all measures to restore/""save"" the tooth are off the table. 

I guess I'm just looking for some relatively like-minded commiseration or to hear similar stories and what your outcomes were.

Have you had teeth pulled in a child under two? If so, how did the permanent teeth fare when they came in?
Have you experienced anything like this?
Watched and waited?
He's working on his upper molars, so he's fiddling about in his mouth, making it hard to tell if this tooth is bothering him.

I'm not looking for recommendations, just to read your versions of dental adventures in youngsters under three.

I post here instead of the dental sub because a search there for this condition was very lean, featuring older kids/adults, and populated with dentists and students who are obviously very closed minded.

So sorry for the length. Good ol mommy guilt over here."

We have a two-year-old. When I'm ""on baby duty"" as we tend to call it, I try to really be ""on"" for him. I'm not always. Yes, sometimes I'm on my phone looking at reddit. Sometimes we sit and watch a movie because I need to rest (24 weeks pregnant). Sometimes I NEED to get a task done on the computer, or just a task he can't be involved in, so I try to let him entertain himself. But I'd say the vast majority of the time, when I'm caring for him, I'm focusing on him. Even if I'm doing chores with him, I'm talking with and engaging him. If I'm feeding him and I'm not also eating (which is rare), I'm either sitting with him and engaging, or I'm nearby so we can see and hear each other and talk (maybe while I'm doing dishes or cleaning up leftovers in the kitchen, for example). I *feel* that I walk a fine line between being attentive and actually spoiling him. I'm trying to be careful. I make him ask nicely when he wants something... I comfort him when he cries without changing my ""no"" to a ""yes."" Etc.. 

My husband... I don't know. He is very, very regularly distracted when he has the kiddo. When he wants to get stuff done around the house, he seems to expect DS to either follow him around or entertain himself, and he gets upset if DS starts to constantly ask to be picked up. If he's feeding DS and not also eating (which is almost always), he will either be doing something totally separate, or he'll go to the bathroom for 20 min, or he'll be on his phone. He will happily answer our son if he asks a question or asks for something, but sometimes our son has to ask a few times to get dad's attention, and if he continues to repeat himself, dad will ignore it (""I already told him he can't have ____."") On a very positive note, dad is BETTER at playing with DS than I am. When he does get down and interact, he REALLY goes all out with playing together with him, and I love seeing them/hearing them play together.

We just... don't seem to see eye to eye, I guess. If I try to point out our son is trying to get his attention while he's on his phone, he gets exasperated with me. If I say basically anything about anything he does while parenting, he doesn't like it. I know that's normal...no one likes to feel questioned or undermined. I try to be very sparing in my comments...

Today at lunch, though, he was trying to wipe DS's face and hands with a washcloth, and DS was resisting, as he's apt to do lately. I KNOW it's trying and frustrating, but I also know he's TWO. He thinks it's funny to be uncooperative. He's not TRYING to aggravate us. DH just forced it slightly too aggressively, and DS started crying pretty hard. I mean, a true sad cry, not just a whiny ""this is no fair"" cry. DH was already pushed to his edge and got a little loud and huffy and frustrated... I was in the same room, on my computer, trying to work. DH is ranting at me about how uncooperative DS is being, and DS is looking at me, crying, tears streaming down his face, needing comfort. DH isn't going to comfort him. He said ""I don't feel sorry for him right now! He's been doing this every day.. How dare I try to wash his hands!"" and just...continued washing DS's hands and face... by then DS just sat there compliantly. It broke my heart a little...

I don't know if my husband thinks I spoil our child. I guess I wouldn't be surprised if he at least wondered. But... I feel there are just two different philosophies at play here, and I'm not sure what to do. I don't feel he's WRONG. I think there are a lot of people who would be equally unsympathetic to a toddler crying at getting his hands washed. And kids in those families will live and learn that hands are getting washed, period, and you don't get to make a fuss about it. Life goes on. But.. I'm not sorry for him because he's getting his hands washed. That's not the point. The point is, he had a real emotion when that escalated, and whatever the CAUSE, that emotion deserved (in my eyes) to be acknowledged and attended to. And, yes, the toddler needed comfort more than my frustrated husband. I didn't step in. I did say ""look at your son!"" ... I just... don't know what to do in these situations.

Does it sound like I'm just coddling? Am I wrong here? Or is this a matter of different parenting philosophies? If the latter, any idea how I can resolve? "
"The ""Talk""",AttachmentParenting,8,57cpbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/57cpbg/the_talk/,2,1476421895.0,"So I just recently posted my first ever reddit post after finding this subreddit and was really excited by the positive response.
Here is my original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/5720jm/a_new_life/

As I mentioned in my other post our little big family have been enjoying cosleeping for a while now and it has made me happier than I have been in a very long time.  I made a comment about how with a 13 year old already going through puberty and two more right on the cusp, I wish my husband was still around to give the ""talk"" more than anything else at the moment.  I mentioned how I felt like I put it off for too long with my oldest and sure enough last night it bit me in the butt.  

Yesterday was another night of getting home late but I have kind of gotten used to my oldest waiting up for me.  I was a bit later than usual and the whole ride home I was looking forward to my kiss and big, long hug.  Usually I will walk in the door and find him on the couch watching TV or playing on his phone but last night he wasn't there.  The TV was on so I figured he had gotten up to go the bathroom or something, but still I was a little disappointed.  I dropped off my stuff in the kitchen after flipping off the TV and lights in the living room.  I stepped out of my scrubs after shimming them off on my way into the laundry room (if you can call it a room, I barely fit in there!), stripped and put on my big night shirt, put my scrubs in the washer and headed to my room.    I peaked into my bedroom and my four youngest were snoozing all cuddled up in my bed but my oldest wasn't in there.  I looked down the hall to the bathroom and it was open and the lights were off, but I noticed the light on in my oldest's room.  So I walked down the hall (I probably should have announced myself but I didn't want to wake up the boys) and the door was halfway closed.  Without thinking about it I pushed the door open and froze solid!  

There he was, my oldest, the man of the house, sitting on the edge of his bed with his pajama bottoms around his ankles, his phone in one hand and his...you know what in the other!  He had his headphones in so I guess he couldn't hear me.  I just stood there in shock for about 15 seconds before backing out slowly and quietly as I could shutting the door behind me.  I snuck off back to my room and got in bed with my boys completely bewildered as to what to do.  Then I realized the door was open when I walked down there and I shut it so he had to know that I saw him and I shut the door!  Now I felt bad for how embarrassed he probably felt!  I kept debating whether I should go down there and talk to him or just let him be but before I could decide he came into my room and climbed into bed, at least acting like he didn't know I saw him.  He gave me a kiss and rolled away.  After my mind raced for an hour or two I finally fell asleep!  

Today I have a day off and a friend is watching my two youngest.  My oldest will be home in about an hour and an hour before his brothers.  I have decided to sit him down and have a talk with him. 
I. am. freaking. out.  >_< haha

I have no plan...I am just going to wing it.  Above all I just want him to feel comfortable with me and be able to tell or ask me anything.  If anyone has any advice I am more than willing to take it into consideration!  

If not, wish me luck!"
A new life,AttachmentParenting,34,5720jm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/5720jm/a_new_life/,8,1476269672.0,"I am a mother of five boys (ages 3, 6, 10, 11, and 13).  About two years ago my husband passed away.  We never really had much relationship with our families.  His parents had both passed before I met him and he had no siblings and I had no siblings and only my father is still alive but we are not close.  My husband was always the bread-winner while I stayed at home with the boys.  We had a big house and everyone had their own room aside from the baby...well baby at the time.  Our little family was basically an island and I always loved it that way because I always thought he would be there.  

He died unexpectedly and it turned out our future was not as solid as I thought it was.  I knew almost right away there was no way to keep our house as even if I got a job I wouldn't be able to keep up with the bills.  So I sold the house and got use set up in a smaller place where the boys ended up having to share (two and three).  I ended up getting a job as a PCT and am working on getting my RN so after all that has happened I have somewhat managed to stabilize our situation.  

The problem quickly became I got to see my boys less and less and it broke my heart all over again.  About three months ago I came home from a long shift and almost everyone (not my oldest) was asleep.  My oldest always waits up for me to give me a hug and a kiss before he goes off to sleep.  I came in the house and he was asleep on the couch with the TV on so I woke him up, got my hug and kiss, and sent him off to bed.  For whatever reason this night it just made me sad that he had waited up for me like that and I just wanted to be near my boys, but they were all sound asleep and I didn't want to disturb them.  So instead (after I showered of course cause anyone who works at a hospital will tell you, ew) I scooped up my youngest and carried him into my bed.  I laid down and held him in my arms and fell asleep almost instantly.  This ended up happening the next few nights too until one night I was just too tired and plopped into bed without showering and thus without scooping up my youngest but after about an hour he climbed into bed with me.  I tucked him in next to me then took off my scrubs (cause again, ew) then cuddled up and fell asleep again.  

Over the next few weeks every time I would get into bed there was another handsome young man crawling into my bed shortly after I fell asleep until finally I had my four youngest sleeping in bed with me.  Thank goodness for my one vice, my king-size bed.  I have never been the most informed woman or anything like that so I had no idea what attachment parenting or cosleeping was, but every night when my boys would crawly into bed with me and we would just be near each other I would feel so much joy and happiness I would almost cry.  

A few nights ago I got home again rather late and my oldest was waiting up for me.  After I got my hug and kiss he asked me if it was okay for him to sleep in my bed too.  I instinctively told him of course it was and I didn't think anything else of it.  At this point I am the one crawling into bed as the boys are already in my bed when I get home more often than not.  

So I am not really sure what I am getting at here as I don't think I am asking for advice or anything like that but I just wanted to share my experience.  I don't even know if I am ""doing it right"" or whatever, but all I know is that I haven't felt this happy since my husband died.  

So, yeah, there it is.  :)  Thanks for reading.  (Also I am open to advice and shit)"
Experiences with Attachment Parenting and Special Needs,AttachmentParenting,3,56xoyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/56xoyt/experiences_with_attachment_parenting_and_special/,4,1476217070.0,"My son, who will be three in December, has not yet been diagnosed but has significant developmental delays. He doesn't speak any words and doesn't walk. He sees an Occupational Therapist, a Speech Pathologist, an Early Interventionist, and we're working with a children's hospital in my area to determine what is causing his developmental delays.

At times I find it very difficult to communicate with him, such as when he pushes his little sister who was born in February. I have a hard time letting him know non-verbally that it isn't okay to push or hit his sister. It doesn't feel right to ignore the behavior, and I do still tell him that we don't hit each other and that it hurts his sister. I've tried removing him from the situation by taking him to sit on the couch thus ending the activity he was doing prior to shoving his sister, but he just thought that was kind of fun.

I will speak to his doctors and therapists about this, but am curious as to what other AP parents might suggest."

I've loved reading your posts and how supportive everyone is. It took six months of instinctual parenting mixed with self-doubt before I discovered it has a name on the Internet! 


I have had a rough few nights with my son who is usually the best sleeping buddy ever. Usually he nurses for a few minutes, then rolls over to face daddy and curls backwards where he sleeps in that silly position for several hours, until he wakes for a brief snack and then repeats the process. It has been nice and that's the reason DH has been so cool about the arrangement (that and a king size bed. 

But LAST night he would roll over for only about a minute before tugging me to nurse and then while nursing- oh the pinching. And tickling. Occasional clapping (?) ok the last part is adorable but not when I wanna sleep. I truly hate missing sleep and I'm a different person in the middle of the night. 

 I want to get mad at him but I at least know better than that even in that state of mind.   Tried giving him a pacifier but he screams bloody murder at that. (I am the only adult not allowed to give him one of those)  this morning I got frustrated and just started crying and fortunately my husband heard my plight and took the baby out of the bed to give me a few hours of peace. 

 I don't really know what I'm trying to say here. I would appreciate some advice or support but even if no one replies maybe this post will help another mom later get through cosleeping. I hope this passes. 

I love sleeping next to my son... the way he puts his feet up on my legs, the way he reaches out for his dad to make sure we're both there.  I love having a place to put clean laundry when I don't have time to get to it (the unused crib). "

My daughter loved pre-school last year and was very confident and social. Then some stuff happened in the summer, she hurt her toe really bad among other similar things, and began to be really attached to me. She sort of stopped going to pre-school summer session mainly because her healing toe was such an issue. There were 2 days where the school called me to pick her up early because she was crying and insisting that she needed me. (Both times were boo-boo or toe related.) So I kept her home the last couple weeks thinking she'd start back up in the fall. Now she is not interested in going back and says she ""knows she will miss me."" I have never forced her to go to preschool because  I never had to--she was always excited to go and play with friends. So now I am wondering, how long will I let her stay home with me, and should I ever force her to go? I am seeing friends on Facebook and from there it seems quite common to force your kid to go when they don't want to. Also, part of me is wondering if I should shop for a different pre-school program. Like one with a better learning philosophy. The one we are currently sending her to is quite basic and mainstream and we love it because of the lo cost and proximity to home. Any advice here?

My son is going to be 9mo in about 2 weeks. I grew up with strict authoritarian, emotionally abusive parents and as a result, I battle with depression and rage/agression. I'm short tempered and often impatient. My parents believed in 'spare the rod, spoil the child' and it's encouraged feelings of physical rage (i don't actually get into fights but I'm always angry and derive enjoyment/relief from smacking and hitting things) that I'm constantly fighting to control. When I decided to accept the commitment of parenthood, I told myself that I did not want my child raised the way I was raised, I didn't want him to constantly be fighting against himself to behave like a decent human being. That's why I chose attachment parenting. And while I'm positive that it's the route I want to take with my child(ren), I struggle when he has his days of crying too much or when he won't listen to me. I want to lash out when I'm at my wits end but he's a baby. He's only doing what a baby does. He doesn't yet have the ability to verbalize his needs and our adult rules go aginst his infant's curiosity and nature. I know this, and knowing this, it doesn't make sense for me to spank him or yell at him for things he doesn't yet understand. And yet, that's what my first thought is. I'm constantly having to pull myself away from my son to calm down and not react the way I've been taught, and it kills me and it scares me. I'm scared that one day I won't be able to pull myself away in time. I'm already looking for a therapist to talk to, and I've been to therapy before, though I didn't find much help besides dealing with my depression. I'm hoping it goes better this time around. But what else can I do? How can I successfully rebel against the authoritarian parenting style I was taught so that I can follow AP? And what are some age appropriate ways to discipline him without spanking him or yelling? I don't want to let him CIO, and sitting down to explain things to him doesn't seem to be working too well for me. What do you guys suggest? Thanks you guys.

[TL;DR] I was raised in an authoritarian household and it has caused lasting effects on me that interfere with my desires to follow AP. How can I overcome my conditioning and keep sane? And what are age appropriate ways to discipline an 8.5mo?"

I'm made to second guess my decisions again. After I thought everything was settled.

So here's the deal. I'm married to a wonderful husband and we have an amazingly bright, happy, healthy 15 month old daughter. I stay at home to take care of her, because Day care would cost too much. I kind of slipped into attachment parenting. I didn't even know it was a thing. I just started babywearing and co-sleeping out of ease. Breastfeeding, bonding at birth, homeopathy and listening to your baby/mommy instinct were things I knew as normal, because that is how babies and children are raised in my home country/culture. By now you've probably realized I'm not american. But I live in america. With my american husband. He mostly stays out of executive decisions, because ""you're the one staying home and you are the one who enforces rules and boundaries with her, so my job is to have your back"". Which is why I love him so very much. But there are things we can't just agree on. He still gives in, but every once in a while, these things will come back up. 

So because DD started getting very active at night, and because I started resenting night time nursing, I decided to move her into her own bed and wean at night. That didn't go over as planned, but she's down to 1 night time feeding and I'm ok with that as opposed to the 4-6 times before that. She will go to bed at 8-9 in her own bed, wake up at around 1am and I grab her, bring her to our bed and nurse her back to sleep. 

She started teething and got a bad cold while attempting to wean, which caused her to nurse every hour all day and night. Shes better and we settled into the 1 time feed, but this brought up the whole cosleeping debate again. My husband was against it and he still wants her out. He told me the latest he wants her gone from the bed is at 2 years. Because he wants her to be ""independent"" and doesn't want her to have to sleep in our bed forever. 

At her last babywell check up, the topic of nursing came up again. I love our pediatrician. He is really great with her and very supportive. We don't see eye-to-eye on certain topics, but agree to disagree. It still rubbed me wring when he said, to stop nursing on demand and only on a parent set schedule. And that he only supports parent led nursing until 2 and then no more nursing. And when asked how to help her sleep better, he told us to put her to bed and let her cry. 

I hate the cry it out method. And I hate how my husband sees it was ""the only way"". I can't just not react to her when she is crying. She'll cry worse and worse and worse and then throw up. I don't want her to go through that. **I** don't want to go through that. And I hate that people assume I'm just to sensitive or coddle my daughter. NO. She knows that when she cries, she can rely on mama. It's exhausting yes, and I've muttered ""go the F*** to sleep"" several sleepless nights. (on a side note, cursing and swearing in front of children in not a big deal in my culture, which caused whole different fights with my inlaws).

I just want my husband to understand, that crying it out is not ""the only way"" and she won't be in our bed forever and she will be fiercely independent. And I need people to stop meddling in how I raise my child. You do you, I do me. If you want to let your child CIO be my guest, but stop criticizing me for my decision. Stop telling me my daughter will me emotionally stunted. She knows how to deal with frustration just fine. 

Sorry for the long post. It feels good to get it off my chest. "

Cosleeping isn't working anymore.,AttachmentParenting,4,4s0eco,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/4s0eco/cosleeping_isnt_working_anymore/,3,1468101599.0,"Hi everyone... 
I'm a first-time-mom of a 7.5 month old little boy. We've been bedsharing since day one since it was the only way he would sleep. For the first 6.5 months he would only sleep on my chest, which was sweet but really hard to maintain. In the past month he's started to seem to prefer nursing side-lying and will roll away when he's done to fall asleep on his own. This has been a major change and it's made quite a difference for my level of comfort. However, I have been going to bed with him at 7 every night and also lay down for all of his naps and I just don't think I can do it anymore. 
He's learning how to crawl now and what used to be a very easy bedtime routine (bath, book, nurse to sleep in minutes) has turned into a much longer routine because he is resisting sleep really hard for naps and nighttime AND he spends about an hour just flailing around and playing and practicing crawling all over me while popping on and off of my nipple until he finally decides it's time to sleep. 
With the early bedtime and multiple naps and with me laying down next to him for all of these he STILL seems to be tired throughout the day. He yawns all the time and gets really cranky throughout the day. 
I'm just starting to feel like sharing the bed might not be working for us. I love having him next to me and the ease of nursing him throughout the night, but the rest of it is beginning to take a toll on my well-being. 
I'm terrified to mess up all the good I've done by nighttime parenting him up until now, and I have no problem with continuing to nurse him during the night.. I just wish he could nap on his own and start the night off in his crib or somehow safely in our bed. 
I need any advice anyone is willing to offer. Or similar experiences and how they've worked out for you. 
Thank you so so much."

I work from home and my husband is a stay at home dad. We have one son who is just about 2.5 years old. We have followed AP since he was born. We cosleep and breastfed until a few weeks ago. He does not attend day care. 

My little guy is very smart and a talker. He is constantly singing or talking. We love and encourage it for the most part. But lately it is nearly impossible to carry on a conversation with my husband. Our son seems to ""compete"" but singing or talking very loudly. 

I'm looking for guidance on how to handle this.  He is smart so I wait until we stop talking and tell him it's not nice to talk while mommy and daddy are talking. He's very interested in what makes me proud. I explain that if he talks while mommy talks to daddy I am not proud.  My husband will break from talking and tell him to be quiet while he's talking. 

Any suggestions on how to handle this?"

People say kids need separate bedrooms for independence and space for parents to be alone but it just seems really unfair to the child. Why does a child have to be more independent than adults who are sleeping together? Grownups do not sleep together because they lack independence. They get to choose independently that they want to share a bed. I think a child should have the same right to choose what bed they want to be on. When grown ups do not sleep alone and like having a warm body next to them we do not judge them for being needy and clingy. So how is the child any different when the child is actually in more need to be next to a warm body to have the assurance the night is not going to swallow him/her, an experience grown ups are more used to. Anyway I wish more people would consider the benefits of sleeping with the children. "

Bubs (16months) is really teething, and caught me with a sharp tooth during a feed, and I screamed (couldn't help it!). This is rare, but it happens. It was ""well, you'll have to get her weaned ASAP to stop that..."". She also talks about littlun getting ""spoilt"", ""clingy"", needing boundaries, being in a ""temper"": all the baby boomer stuff that the in-laws also say.

I know avoiding the issue by never complaining is the best option, I was just wondering if anyone had any methods for dealing with this, especially since it is more forced now we're in close proximity. I can't be 100% loving it all the time!! I think the difference between our parenting methods is partly generational, but also I think anything I do differently is seen as a criticism of how she parented me and my sibling. Bubs is the first grandchild. I'm confident about standing up for our way of doing things, but I don't want to hurt Mom's feelings by putting my foot down too brutally. She often feels she can't ever ""win"" a debate with me, as I'm ""better with words"". Oh, and my Dad is such a softie that he went right through AP to permissive parenting, she was always the tougher one, and they were divorced 20 years ago, so it also looks like I'm taking sides!

I hadn't really researched or read much in preparation for parenting (the amount of information seemed overwhelming). I've spent the past 4 months just following her cues, and doing what felt right at the time. Which for us is: breastfeeding to sleep, naps in the ergo baby (she hates flying solo in the pram, so I've just ditched it), meditative breastfeeding sessions (ie long boob in mouth naps), and we sleep with our beds pushed beside each other (one side off the cot), and then she sleeps in the middle of us for 2nd half of the night. 

I'm hitting some hickups regarding naps (my daughter isn't daytime napping anymore). I've reached out for advice (to the GP and Mothers groups ect), I also phoned my Maternal Child health nurse hotline, who explained that it sounded like I was practicing the attachment parenting style, and so most of the advice I was getting would contradict my parenting style. 

So, I thought I'd look you guys up p, subscribe and introduce myself, and hopefully get some advice from parents who are going through similar stuff :)

If I lie him on the bed, or slow the bouncing and patting, he screams! (Further information, I co-sleep, feed/walk to sleep, no medical problems).
So I’ve been letting him get up and play. I have a cup of tea and after about 40mins, I babywear him starting the +1 hour night walk/bounce/jiggle. Usually he’s quite relaxed, sometimes he screams, arching his back I guess because he just wants to keep playing??
Is that permissive parenting? I don’t want him to learn that he gets what he wants by screaming but that seems to be the main way he communicates  For example: son walks up to me, screams, I stand up, he pushes me over to the counter, screams, I pick him up, son points at various objects until I locate the correct one – scissors – “no you cannot have them”, screams, try to distract him from scissors with 10 other things, eventually succeed or offer boob. You get the picture!!
Is this permissive parenting? My mum and friends think he’s turning into a tyrant but I am just trying to be responsive to what he’s communicating and the co-sleeping + boob to sleep obviously doesn’t seem to work… but then again, nothing does!

My wife and I were able to craft her environment and focus our emotional energy on her.

Now, with two kids, I just don't understand what my mindset should be. The same emotional environment doesn't fit an 11-month old who has largely physical needs at this point and a 3.5-year old who can hold conversations and express her creativity.

I'm sure I have a ton of specific questions, but it's hard to even find the words for them because my problem is that I just don't *get* it yet. I really hope it snaps into place for me and I can begin to understand.

Has anyone been in the same situation and can offer advice? I don't know how long a 6 month old can comfortably go between feeds, or how this will change as she gets older.

Most folks talk about AP when the kids are babies and toddlers because that's when parenting is so stressful and you have big decisions to make, but going with a connected approach worked out so well for us in the preschool years.

Yesterday at the store my 4 year old daughter wanted to get something.  I told her no and I stuck to it.  She pouted a little and we talked it through:

""I can see that you are feeling sad and mad that we're not getting anything for you""

""I AM sad and mad!  I wanted a toy!""

""It's OK to feel sad and mad. Here's the thing, I already said no to the toy, and I have to make sure to be honest with you so you know when I say no I mean no and when I say yes I mean yes. It's OK to feel your feelings, but my being honest with you is more important than a toy.  Would a cuddle help?""

<sigh>  ""Yeah""

<big cuddles and leaving the store without a fuss>

I was so proud of my kid and how well AP practices have prepared her to talk through challenges rather than melting down.  Stick with it - it's worth it!"
Fighting boogers,AttachmentParenting,5,4bdce4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/4bdce4/fighting_boogers/,9,1458611214.0,"Hi there!

My little one (7 months) had a cold recently. Luckily he's mostly over it but still has a bit of a congested nose, especially at night. We try to loosen the snot by giving a saline solution nasal spray and then sucking it out with the nose frieda. I hate doing it, because he hates it, screams and wiggles trying to get away from the nose thingy. I would love to drop it completely, but I think the stuffy nose makes him wake up a lot, up to every 20 minutes for several hours. At least I think the nose is the problem. But I might be wrong and it could be something totally different (growth spurt? gas? constipated from recently starting solids?). 

We tried giving him the nose sucker to play with, so it is some weird foreign object I try to put in his nose. I tried to do it slowly, showing him the thing and all, but both just end with him chewing on it. I try to sing and comfort him during and after, nurse him afterwards to calm him down. He is usually totally fine when I'm done (and might even appreciate the freed up nose, even if he doesn't connect the dots), but I still feel awful. Especially during his night sleep, when he's not really sleeping but also not really awake (cause he's super tired but something is bugging him) it startles him. It always end in kind of a fight, where I try to hold/pin down his arms and holding his head still to remove the snot from his nose.

So, my question now is, how do you handle this? Do you have any tricks on how to make it easier for your baby? Any other solutions to stuffy noses?"
Tantrums/crying as babies get older,AttachmentParenting,8,49u1w0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/49u1w0/tantrumscrying_as_babies_get_older/,12,1457654840.0,"So my husband and I, who are usually on the same page about crying (which is to not let it happen) have run into a little bump in our parenting road. My son is 9.5 months old. We've done the attachment parenting thing his whole life. Babywearing, bedsharing, responding to his cries/whines, etc. 

My son is a very active little guy. He loves to just move move move. This moving also happens with diaper changes and getting dressed. Just here recently (the last month or so) he's been really distressed when having either done. It prevents him from crawling and rolling and playing...I understand it, so does my husband. But I usually try to distract him with a toy, a new object to look at, singing, whatever. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. My husband usually does too.

But last night, while getting him dressed after a bath he said he's afraid we're coddling him too much. That we give in to his whines and cries, and because of this he's afraid he'll be a bit spoiled later on. 

I guess I just haven't thought that far ahead, more just going day to day with what he needs and such. What are your thoughts on this? How do you go about dealing with an older baby who's just having a bit of a tantrum as opposed to one who's crying in actual distress.

I'm a bit at a loss as to what to do. I automatically want to pick him up and snuggle him. Make it all better, even if there's nothing actually wrong (aside from his inability to do what he wants). My instincts have served me well his entire life so far...I just do what I think is best instead of thinking into how, as my family puts it, I'm ""spoiling him"".

How do you handle older babies, toddlers, and children when it comes to tantrums?

He thinks it's ok to do so for a short period of time, as long as her basic needs (food, diaper) are being met. I prefer to soothe her asap. His reasoning is we can't keep responding to every sound she makes, because eventually I'll go back to work (currently on mat leave) and we need the time at home not only to take care of the baby, but also to do chores.

LO is 6 weeks old and not a fussy baby at all, so this doesn't happen often and didn't come up before. But this makes me anxious to leave her alone with her dad, I'm afraid he will let her cry it out long before she's ready for this. He already admitted he doesn't see a problem with this, because it's what our parents did and we 'turned out ok'. He says it's what we'll have to do eventually.

Please, what research can I show him to make him understand there's more to parenting a newborn than changing diapers and giving bottles/nurse?"

The only thing I've noticed that I can think of alternative suggestions to are things like responding quickly to crying, and avoiding ""[baby trainers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_parenting#In_practice)"" - the cry-it-out approaches, etc. Are things like that the major difference?"
Almost-5-month-old doesn't nap well :( need some serious help.,AttachmentParenting,9,4860e4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/4860e4/almost5monthold_doesnt_nap_well_need_some_serious/,10,1456725187.0,"I think I posted here a couple of months ago looking for help with getting my baby to have daytime sleep. Well now she's about a week out from being 5 months old and she still doesn't nap well. I had a couple of days last week where she had two awesome 1.5 hour naps, then a 30 min nap in the evening, and I was so excited. But since then, some days she has only had a couple of 20 or 30 min naps and I think there was one day where she didn't nap at ALL until the evening.

I'm at my wits end because 

1). I feel there is no structure to our day so I never leave the house because I am trying so hard to observe and learn my baby's cues, and I STILL CAN'T READ HER AT NEARLY 5 MONTHS. I have friends who take their babies to playgroups and activities and shiz and I don't do ANY of that.

2). my baby is often really cranky.

3). I don't get any time to do normal things like cook dinner or take a nap myself or do a workout and I am SO TIRED and sick of hearing my baby yelling and crying.

Rubbing her eyes and yawning is not a good indicator of her being tired, I have found, because whenever I have responded to her doing that and tried to get her down for a nap, she has still been wide awake and it's failed. WHY??

I like to nurse her to sleep because I feel this is the easiest way to comfort her and help her wind down, but it seems when I do this she will wake 20 or 30 minutes later. I can't tell if she wakes because she is still hungry or not. When I try to give her a ""full feed"", she fusses and plays and loses interest after a few minutes. So I try to keep her up for a while but she gets cranky. Then when I try nursing to sleep again, she again only feeds for a little bit before drifting off. Then wakes again a short time later. It's driving me NUTS. I read that nursing to sleep can be a cause of catnapping, but I quite like the fact that it's a natural and loving way to calm baby. But I don't know how to get it right!

Can I put her on some sort of ""routine"" to help get a rhythm and some predictability with her? I use the word routine lightly because I don't mean a rigid schedule, just something that will help both of us to know what to expect next, but with flexibility of course. 

She hardly even naps in a sling or in the pram. She'll nap for 20 mins and that's it. Wide awake again and grumpy. 

She is being treated for silent reflux, but to be honest I don't even know if she's truly got SR or if she just gets overtired and cries because of that. I am so freaking over all this it has crossed my mind to just put her on formula and give her to my husband for a few days while I check into a hotel and SLEEP and forget about everything for a bit.

I've been trying bedsharing with her which is nice sometimes BUT - she often gets stroppy and packs a shit latching on and off my boob all the time, and my hip/lower back get really sore from the weird way my body is tilted in order to get my boob at the right level for baby's face. I also have a bad shoulder/neck which gets aggravated having to sleep in that position for a long period of time. I think co-sleeping with her on her own mattress next to mine would be good... if she would only NAP.

Has anyone else been in a similar position? What helped? Did you have to stop nursing to sleep? Or did baby just go into his/her own natural routine as he/she got older? Helphelphelphelpheeelllpppp. I am not having a fun time and I feel so bad that I can't just enjoy my baby :( I mean I do enjoy her but a lot of the time I am very much NOT enjoying her."
Need advice on cosleeping,AttachmentParenting,5,47yyxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/47yyxq/need_advice_on_cosleeping/,14,1456644302.0,"We've been bedsharing since the beginning (9 months today actually) and I've been wanting to transition my son to sleep by himself. Still in my room, but just in a different sleeping area than me. 

Here lately we've been waking each other up more. It's just kinda become more of a nuisance for both of us than a convenience (like it used to be).

The problem? He doesn't like to be put down in a crib or bassinet. And my husband (who doesn't help hardly at all at night...he's a heavy sleeper so it's not safe but also a bit selfish about his sleep, so he sleeps in a different room) says it's either bedshare or CIO. That there are no other options that'll work for us. 

He won't even consider other things so I guess I'm all alone on this also. He thinks putting him down and then picking him back up to soothe him every time he wakes up to cry is ridiculous and not the norm. He thinks everyone just does extinction crying. But it's more because he's ignorant and refuses to believe otherwise (so a bit of an idiot for refusing to enlighten himself...sorry, mini rant on him because I'm mad at him).

So any advice on how to approach both my son's sleeping arrangements and my husband's viewpoints???"

She is 17 months old, still very much breastfed, co-sleeping etc and I don't know if I have a question as such, just are there other parents here who have a 'spirited' child?! She is quite content but we have problems with ear-splitting screams that grab the attention of everyone in the vicinity. For example, today when I had to pick her up in public she was enjoying walking and she lost her MIND. It is so embarrassing and frustrating esp when she hits. I know all toddlers do this kind of thing but the reaction from friends and family say otherwise. We are strict with her at home and don't give in all the time. Does any of this sound familiar?

My son recently turned 2. We've had a lovely on-demand breastfeeding relationship since the day he was born. 
For a little background - I work from home and my SO is a SAHD. We've been using AP principals in our parenting style before we knew what AP was. For us it was simply instinctual parenting. 
I didn't plan of breastfeeding for 2 years, it just kind of happened, again following instinct. Lately  my son has been so demanding for breastfeeding that i feel myself getting resentful. He CONSTANTLY nurses at night (we cosleep)He never stops asking in the day.  I will breastfeed him in the hopes to satiate him, but he just asks again in an hour.
I really believe in child-led weaning but have been desperate to encourage the process. I've been to kellymom and have tried several techniques listed there. I tell him that ""sides"" (he calls it sides because we say switch sides) go night night when we go night night. I tell him we will do sides after his bath, etc.
Mostly he has a meltdown over the postponing of ""sides"". I've tried holding out but usually just give in because it seems so stressful on him. 
I should mention that my son has a plethora of food allergies. I'm hoping he will outgrow them and I understand children with food allergies can be a little high needs. 
I suppose I'm mostly looking for moral support. I feel just awful that I am feeling bad about breastfeeding. I'm not sure if I need to make changes with myself or my overall relationship with my son to curb his desire to nurse. I make lots of time for cuddles, we sing together, read together, play together. My SO is supportive and makes sure we get one on one time. 
I'm just very frustrated."

There was no strict schedule, we didn't use timers or rewards or incentives at first. We just put a potty in easy access and said ""hey look you can pee in that!"" We'd ask her if she wanted to try it, sometimes she would sometimes she'd refuse but we didn't push or pressure her. She made no effort whatsoever to go on her own. Like it never occurred to her to not go in her pants. As she got older we tried rewards, sticker charts, timers, reminders and laying off and telling her it was her body and it was up to her. We've tried putting her in pull-ups so she could get them on and off on her own, we've tried underwater and naked time but she'd just pee on the floor and splash in the puddle! She'll pee on the furniture too. She has pooped on the potty one time when she was naked but since then has just pooped on the floor. She still makes no effort whatsoever to go on her own. She'll soil herself and sit in it if we let her. If we ask her if she pooped she'll run and hide. We've never shamed or punished her for going in her pants. We try to explain that she can't go to school until she learns to use the potty on her own. She loves playing with other kids and I'd love to put her in a kiddie martial arts or dance/group type class but no one will take untrained kids. i know that constipation could be a factor but I can't force water or miralax down her throat. And even when her poops are softer, same problem. Should I put her on a strict timer? Does that train her or me? What am I missing? I talked to her doctor about a year ago, she didn't seem worried and said the timeline was normal. any insight?

Edit to add: thanks for the replies! I guess I'll just have to do the strict schedule thing. Hopefully it doesn't become a power struggle which is why I avoided making her sit every 45 minutes or so. "
Husband vent and plea for help...,AttachmentParenting,10,44xl9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/44xl9b/husband_vent_and_plea_for_help/,10,1455065702.0,"First, I love my husband. He is a great dad. But he just doesn't get it sometimes and I find myself resenting him often.

Our daughter is 12 months old. I stay home with her. She nurses often, and we bedshare for naps and at night. She is a velcro baby and not content to play on her own for more than a few minutes at a time. If I need to get things done, I'm going to be wearing a 22 lb baby or she's going to be underfoot fussing or clinging to me. I also have a few freelance projects I am working on, so if I get a baby break I am often still working.

I love my daughter so much and believe in my parenting style so much that usually I can deal. But the combo of many sleepless nights in a row plus fussy (teething??) baby plus work deadlines recently has me on edge.

I don't think my husband understands how exhausting it can be to care for a baby like 22 or more hours a day. But because we are nursing it's hard to let him step in as much as I'd like. This is maybe mostly my fault because I hate pumping and just have a hard time stepping back in general. Plus I know I have chosen this way of parenting, so I sometimes feel like I just have to lie in the bed I made if you know what I mean.

Last night baby girl was up a lot. Nursing, wetting diapers, needing bouncing, etc. I very, very rarely ask for help at night. Last night hubby saw I was struggling and changed one diaper and dosed her with ibuprofen. So, okay, that was nice. At that point it was like 5 am and she was asleep in his arms so I asked if he would just let her sleep on him for a while so I could get some rest. Again, I only ask this if I am at the end of my rope. He refused saying he needed to get some sleep before work.

Then he texts me from work this morning about how ""fucking exhausted"" he is. It just made me feel really sad and alone. Like, he doesn't realize how much I am really up with her at night. Or that I haven't slept more than maybe 4 hours at a stretch in over a year. Or that he gets to sit at his desk and relax and drink a cup of coffee or use the bathroom or eat without a tiny person crying or climbing on him or needing something NOW.

I try not to hold this against him because his job is stressful in a different way. He has to provide financially for our family. And he does help me as much as he can when he's home. 

I just wish he understood how much I do and sacrifice for our family and how hard it is sometimes. 

I try to communicate some of these things but it's hard not to feel like I'm attacking or nagging him.

Anyone else in the same boat? How do you navigate your marriage when you're so attached to your children? Where do you get validation if your partner seems to take so much of what you do for granted? Is this just what it's like to be an attached mother?"

I love it because he's more interested in his surroundings and loves to be a part of everyday life, more now than ever. But it's kinda a bummer because if I need to do errands or clean or just wanna get out of the house, he won't sleep. He needs to be rocked (and usually sung to) with a fan or white noise in the background to nap.

However, are there solutions to help him sleep sooner, and sometimes by himself? We got the no cry sleep solution, but so far it just seems like an assortment of possible things you could do pulled from the Internet. "

I need some help helping my friend. For the second time in her life, the father of her child left to be with someone else. She has two children - one a 4 y/o (who has come to see this guy as Dad) and the other a 1 y/o and she's very much an attachment parenting Mom. 

Has anyone else been through this? Do you have any advice for her on making it through? 

She's totally in despair, and doesn't feel comfortable being away from the baby for more than a couple of hours at a time, so all my would-be suggestions of ""Get out and have fun! Forget about him! Etc."" really don't apply. And we live on opposite sides of the country, so I can't go over to hang out with her.

When we were sick, we took baths and slept instead of going to the doctor and getting medicine.  Even now, no matter how sick I am, I prefer to tough it out instead of taking a DayQuil.  Now, I'm faced with the biggest ""tough it out"" situation of all: childbirth. Obviously, there is a HUGE difference between not taking a DayQuil when sick and not having an epidural when giving birth.

I've also done a lot of research on how medicine may affect the baby or lead to further medical intervention.  However, I don't know if I have the mental fortitude and perspective through adversity to get through a birth without an epidural.  It is SO scary.  My heart wants a natural childbirth for all the reasons I've found in research on non-medical birth, but my mind is scared as hell and doesn't believe I can do it.

So, my question is: for those who have had epidurals, do you sense any long term effects on your baby?  Did it hamper breastfeeding? Take away from your bonding?   I would love your thoughts. "

We went and saw some funk music at a local restaurant.  It was loud, but not concert loud.  Nevertheless, I put on his little ear protection muffs, which are actually just ballistic muffs that happen to fit him perfectly.

We danced for a while; he fell asleep in the carrier of course.  He loves music.

Anyway, there were lots of awesome friends there and, as often is the case, I fielded a lot of questions about what it's like to wear a baby for so many hours each day.

Eventually, he started to wake up and squeeze my chest, which he does when he's hungry, so I decided to pack up and head out to take him to the mama, who was at home - a 1/2 mile walk.

He didn't fuss one iota the whole night.  Got home, went straight to the breast, and was happy as a clam.  Perfect!

Except...

While I was leaving the restaurant, a woman (another patron at the restaurant) stepped in front of my path and said, ""Is that a REAL baby?!""

I smiled and said yes, but she got angry.

""This is not a place for a baby.  Don't you think it's too loud?""

""Well, he has ballistic-rated muffs on; he's been sleeping nearly the whole time.""

""You are endagering the welfare of a child.  I can't believe this.""  

And she stormed off, out the building.  

She seemed drunk, but not wasted.  She was just... so filled with hate.  It was really weird.

Anyway, I'm not to tore up about it; I feel no particular need to defend myself to her.  I am a very proud parent.

But now I can't stop thinking about it.

I'm wondering from y'all:

1) What do you say to someone like this?

2) How do you feel better after someone does this?

What else can I try? Should I change her bedtime routine? She isn't a struggle to get to sleep at bedtime it's just all the wakings. And whether or not she boobs to sleep or not doesn't make any difference. If I leave she cries and I can't bear crying. And we are ttc too and it's just too much!"

We are a low income family living in my parents basement currently until we can get things back under control with bills. 
Anyway! My daughter and I have been co sleeping ever since she came home from the hospital since we are breastfeeding. I thought I'd only be using the bassinet for a month and then some how we would transition her to her crib in her nursery which is literally right next to our bedroom. Well here we are reaching almost 7 months and we are co sleeping and bed sharing. I do get okay sleep. She still wakes like 6x at night to nurse and have comfort. I wish it was like only twice but she fusses the entire night. I love bed sharing and co sleeping but I hate it at the same time. And honestly I feel super obligated to use her crib and nursery because my dad bought us the crib for our baby shower gift and I've used it like 4 times. I've had her start off in her room and the later after the first waking id just bring her in our room because I just hate feeling like she is so far away. That might seem silly but I can't sleep with out her. I guess maybe just knowing she is super safe next to me makes me feel better and I'm able to sleep. My boyfriend and I share a queen size bed and my daughter and I take up most of it. Buying a king size or another bed is out of the question because we struggle to even buy groceries. I was thinking about just moving her crib to our room and using it like a side car that way she is safer and my boyfriend has more room on the bed too. But then I feel bad because we won't be using the nursery very much. Also my daughter is very big for her age. She is actually 6.5 months and she is wearing 24 month clothes. And for those wondering yes she is healthy. She is EBF. Big just runs in our family. So I'm just looking for a suggestion on what I should do! Should I change my nightly routine or put her in more of a bed time routine to get her into her own room and crib? What has worked for you? "

I took to nursing her in bed and then just falling asleep with her. We are still doing this at 7 months because we both enjoy it so much. She always naps well, eats well, and I get some rest and snuggles or browse the web. I prefer to do chores when she's awake.

I am getting more and more self conscious of this habit though, since I don't know anyone else who naps with their baby. My family thinks it's weird and indulgent. And it does cause issues when we're away from home or are entertaining guests. in those cases I try to wear her for naps but that can be exhausting. I can sometimes nurse her to sleep in bed and then slip away, but she often wakes up within minutes or if not, I feel like I need to hover nearby and check on her every few minutes. 

I guess I'm wondering, should I just keep doing what works for us? Or should I really start trying to get her to nap on her own? I love sharing sleep with my daughter. it's one of the things I most look forward to during the day but I don't want to hinder her development in any way. TIA!"

He's still a baby so of course he doesn't know not to take things off other kids yet or not to hit or that sometimes hugs aren't wanted and there's no need to use nails while giving a hug. He is exuberant and loving and has such a huge personality. He also doesn't sign or speak so anytime he wants anything it involves screaming. 

It's really tough for my guy to the point where he'll spend the entire day clinging to me and crying if I try to put him down (he's never been much of a crier). Throughout the day he'll wave and say ""bye"" to the other boy. I know there are lots of types of kids out in the world and I don't want to shelter mine but I can only imagine what's going on in his little head where every single toy he picks up is taken off him or if he walks any where near the other kid he gets hugged so hard he falls over with nail scratches (it's hot so mine doesn't wear clothes in the house). 

I mediate where I can. Saying things like ""C is playing with that right now, here's another toy"" or ""C doesn't feel like a hug right now, hug Hobbes (stuffy)"" Each of which are answered with screams. 

I'm sorta at a loss. Right now we've got the other boy a few days per week but starting mid August it'll only be once a week. How do you handle a spirited child with a sensitive child at the same time? Do I just stick mine in a ring sling all day and keep them somewhat separated? I'm hoping that once we start the once a week thing it'll be better. We'll also have another little girl on different days who is very similar personality wise to my guy."

I have told him over and over that I do not want that for my daughter and my style of parenting naturally had just so happened to be attachment parenting. His response is ""well you survived"" or ""I let u cry it out and you turned out great!"" Well actually no, I didn't. I have a lot of depression and anxiety issues.

FAQ here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/RIE/comments/3cgg1l/faq_on_rie/

I am a new follower of the RIE principles, and I was surprised and a little disappointed that there is not as much publicity for RIE as there is for other parenting philosophies.

I feel passionately that every parent should have a multitude of parenting tools at their behest, so they can choose the one that aligns most with their values, core beliefs and situation.

I went through so much heartache while trying to bring up my son right, I would be so happy if anything I have learnt can benefit other parents.


The sub is not very active right now, I'm the only one posting, and I need help. If you like the RIE principle, and you find an article you like, please post it in the sub, along with a comment on how it helped you.

Today we’ll do things differently, today is just for you
I’ve stopped the world from spinning round, today’s about us two
We won’t rush to get dressed or clean the breakfast from your face
We’ll linger with your favorite toys and take things at your pace

Let us give the shops a miss today and scrap doing the chores
Let me oblige and sing that song each time you tell me more
Let me pick you up each time you pull and ask me for a cuddle
And if I don’t attempt a million things, I won’t get in a muddle

And when we wander out today, I won’t make you wear your hat
You can pause at every flower, say hello to every cat
If you want to, you can walk about, even though it takes us longer
And when you’re tired, I’ll scoop you up ‘cause your love makes me stronger

You’re a million kinds of precious, and though I shouldn’t need reminding
I sometimes have to stop and think, but thanks to you I’m finding
That our lives are full of magic in between the other stuff
And what you give is all I need, love really is enough

So let us read an extra story, let us make a bit more mess
No worries that we’re running late, no calls to make, no stress
I’m going to try and see the world just like you do each day
As an exciting big adventure and a brand-new game to play

For today, my task is not to clean or wash or tidy up
It’s to chase you ‘til you laugh out loud and beg for me to stop
It’s to play the silly games you love and take you to the park
It’s to be with you ‘til evening falls and the sky outside turns dark

Then I’ll carry you to bed tonight with a happy, tired yawn
And hold you close for twice as long, just like when you were born
And if sleep does not come easily, tonight I will not mind
The world can wait, I’ll stay with you until your dreams you find

And tomorrow might be different as that’s just the way it goes
But whatever stuff life throws at us, I hope you always know
You fill our hearts up to the brim and make the dull seem new
You grow and laugh and share and love, and teach us all this too"

My daughter is just about 10 months. She wakes to eat at least 3x per night. I work full time and i'm exhausted. I really hate CIO and I really don't want to night-wean until at least a year. I was hoping until even later than that, really. But I am so freaking exhausted. We have resorted to putting her to sleep at bedtime in the swing because she does ""bedtime gynmastics"" and is so active and squirming for at least an hour or 1.5 hours and i just can't handle it and hold her that long trying to get her to fall asleep. So the swing it is, but she's almost too big for it. She's never slept in her crib, she screams immediately when you put her in it. She even fusses in her swing at bedtime, you have to sit there with her where she can see you or she loses it. She sleeps the rest of the night in a cosleeper/pack n play in our room after her first waking. She also hates that and lately will fuss when i put her in there even after she has just nursed. She used to just go right to sleep after midnight nursings. Now she does about 60% of the time. I always had trouble doing side-lying nursing. I couldn't get her lined up and i could never fall asleep with her right there, i just sit there awake. Also, my husband doesn't really want her in the bed. So she's mostly been in the cosleeper, but lately i've been trying side-lying and cosleeping again. She rolls all over, yells, and kicks/punches at me.  I can't fall asleep easily but maybe i could get used to it with time? I don't know what to do. How long is this really going to last? We've been waiting for her to sleep longer stretches for so long and I just feel like at this point, its never going to happen and i'm going to be up every 2-3 hours until she's 2 years old. When did your kid sleep longer stretches? Is my kid normal? What the hell is going on? Is there anything I can do besides CIO? I hear so many people say their kid will sleep 12 hours, 6 hours even FOUR HOURS at much younger ages, i cannot imagine sleeping for 4 hours in a row.

But recently, he has started really acting out violently. It happens primarily when he is tired, and occasionally during the day. He slaps, tiny punches, pulls my hair, pinches, headbutts, bites, licks (he knows it bothers me) and kicks. This is all primarily directed at me specifically. When I tell him that it hurts me, that it's mean, that I don't like it, anything like that trying to teach & reason with him, he just gives me this blank stare, and usually continues the behavior. During the day, I can take him outside, and this immediately calms him down, he just needed to burn some energy, or I can give him a bath and he's happier. But at night, when I'm trying to get us to sleep is when this gets really bad. We bedshare, and I love it! He recently got his own toddler bed that we placed sidecar next to ours, and he has slept in it happily 2 full nights now.

Some background about me: I am a military mommy. I normally work very long hours, and twice I have had to leave him for 5-6 weeks for deployment. We have lost a lot of time together that I would rather have spent at home. I was raped at work last fall, and that coupled with his birth being traumatic for me, has me working through PTSD right now. We lost our nursing relationship because of this at 14 months; I had had every intention of nursing at least until 2, or when he chose to wean. I am his 'primary' person, the one that he ALWAYS wants, needs, turns to. He is normally a very sweet boy. He is kind and loving; I am 6 months pregnant, and he is very tender with my belly, he seems genuinely excited to be a big brother. 

I just don't know how to react in a healthy way to this behavior. My anxiety level is through the roof, and this behavior pushes so many buttons for me. I react emotionally often rather than rationally, especially when I am very tired. I love this sweet boy more than life itself.  I feel like I must be causing the behavior somehow without realizing it. I must be doing something that is frustrating him, triggering it, but I just don't see it. He has also shown some aggression toward our dog, mauling his ears and hitting him with random objects with no provocation. The dog is amazing with him, he never reacts except to whine in pain. He is an older dog, and I feel absolutely terrible every time he does it. Up until a few weeks ago, we could get him to show ""nice hands"" and say that he was sorry, but he has become less and less remorseful, and almost petulant. If the behavior is aimed towards me, and he is removed from me, either taken to another room or I leave the room, then he loses his mind crying, begging to be with mommy, so sad and upset, but often will go right back to acting out. 

Please, please help me be gentle with this boy. How do I help him, how do I fix this?! Obviously I am working on getting counseling, and I have been talking to many people about help for myself. I feel like every day this goes on is irreparable damage to his tiny person, I am desperate to nip it in the bud and help him grow past it. Thank you so much for your help and support!"

Do they deserve the considerations of respect, equality, and justice? I think so, and as these concepts are valuable to me, I hope that they become valuable to them.

Bonus question, any side lying nursing advice for small, downward pointing breasts? The nursing itself is quite difficult for us lying down. 

Edit: (One month later) Almost immediately after posting this, I fell while holding baby. I managed to keep him from hitting the ground, but I took the fall full force on my knee and couldn't walk for a while (crutches for over a week, a cane for over a week after that). Almost a month later I still have pain in the knee and trouble walking. Anyway, because of the situation I had a crash course in co sleeping, or I wouldn't have been able to get to baby! (Even with a sidecar positioned cradle I couldn't lean over at all for a while.)
I ended up doing one blanket low enough across my chest to also go over his, and I threw a microfleece baby blanket over my other shoulder. This way we were able to be skin to skin and I didn't freeze or worry about him smothering. I am since MUCH less freaked out about it and still often cosleep.

Because the ultimate message I want to get across is no, I'm not the boss of you.  You're your own person.  But does that mean there can be no rules?  How do you guys balance this?

My instinct would be to say something like, ""you're right, I'm not the boss of you.  But we have a rule that [you go to bed by 9], because otherwise you get grumpy the next day.  Do you remember times when that's happened before?  You can stay up late tonight if you want, but you'll probably feel better tomorrow if you go to bed now.""

But maybe that's a bad example, maybe it would be better for them to just learn from their own mistakes.  Can you actual parents give me a more applicable situation where ""you're not the boss of me"" is an issue?  Or do you never tell your kids to do things they don't want to do?  Is it more gentle guidance of ""this is probably a good idea but choose what you want""?

I just feel sort of conflicted.  I like this kiddo, Mom is providing food/drinks/cake and renting out a room, and planning activities.

My nearly 3 year old girl has been extra emotional lately.  She will storm off to her room and cry, and wait to see if I come check on her.  If I don't she comes out and announces ""I was crying in my room!""

Individually I did my best to handle the occurrences, ask what she was upset about and try to work it out.  Today I thought I'd just ask her about the root of the behavior.

I pulled her in my lap and said ""why do you come to you room to cry?""

""I'm sad""

""Are you maybe needing extra cuddles and this is how you know for sure I'll come give them to you?""

""Yeah""

""Ok, well tell you what- next time you need extra cuddles come tell me and we can skip the crying part.  I'll do my best to be available for you.  But sometimes I'll need you to wait, like if I'm cooking - ok?""

""Ok""

Not really sure how much she really would process at still under 3 years old.  But sure enough, later tonight she started to get upset at a limit we had set and she said ""mama, I need a cuddle!""  And we curled up together.

So proud of my expressive little one, and pretty pleased to address the connection need rather than the behavior problem."

This is a lot longer than I intended :-/
My daughter turns one in three weeks, we breastfeed on demand still (down to around 6 times a day, and if I'm very lucky 2 at night, more often 3-4). We're also doing baby led weaning which took a while to get going but she now is actually eating three meals a day (albeit not every day still, and some days are better than others...but it is improving day by day). We don't co-sleep anymore, I've gone montessori stylie and she has a baby proofed room and single mattress on the floor. I nurse her to sleep, and then re nurse her to sleep during the night. SOMETIMES she even wakes up and goes back to sleep herself. Nap times are in the pushchair/car/on the boob.
I pump at work.

One is the magical cut off for everything it seems, and whilst I'm sort of happy to continue as is, I feel I need to introduce cows milk, (will certainly be nice to get rid of pump, but does she still have it on days I'm not at work??), how will I get her to nap without boob? She HATES being rocked or stroked or cuddled. She wants me next to her and within touching distance,maybe with one hand on me at night but not to be held! All these no cry sleep solutions aren't so good for my mega independent yet wants me right ""there, no not there don't touch me mummy, THERE"" 

How much cows milk does she have? Do I warm it? Does she have cows and mums milk interchangeably? How do I make her have food when she's hungry instead of wanting boob?
How do I get her to nap?! I'm not always around, and the pushchair works for my mum who has her when I'm at work, but doesn't always work for me...

What about her bed, when does it become a bed not a mattress?! 

One feels like this magical age when she eats more and drinks cows milk and goes to sleep without boob and I feel I'm going to get an awful lot of snide comments if I just carry on doing what I'm doing now. Which is really what's working so should I? Doesn't she need more food and less boob milk though? Argh!! 
 
I know most of these questions aren't specific to here and I should possibly make three different posts but I'm sure if they get posted in many other subreddits I'll just get told things I don't want to hear/do! She's not crying. That's just not happening!! 

So, what are your experiences? I have noticed her eat more, drink less over the last six months so do I just keep doing what I'm doing nut add in cows milk? And any sleep ideas?

Oh and we are talking about baby number two, but I still haven't got my period back... I guess with all the bf on demand. And that's a whole new load of questions about getting her to sleep when I'm enormous and can't get on her mattress"

For naps I make sure the baby monitor is on so I can hear every little peep and get him as soon as he wakes up (or at least spy on him when he wakes and plays- I like that he's fairly independent waking up). 

At night time though he tends to have a middle of the night play time where he'll hang out in the side-carred crib playing while hubby and I continue sleeping. I'm concerned that he'll take off towards the door and fall off the bed.

It's modern society, with its lack of long-term breastfeeding, smacking, strollers, parental distance, sleeping in different rooms and so on which is an exception to the norm, not APs.

The most beautiful bit? When he describes the supreme emotional stability of many traditional peoples, the absolute faith they have in their family and social circles, and why. Here's the bit which is most relevant to APs:

> We see that people in small-scale societies spend more time talking to each other than we do, and they spend no time at all on passive entertainment supplied by outsiders, such as television, video games, and books. We are struck by the precocious development of social skills in their children. These are qualities that most of us admire, and would like to see in our own children, but we discourage development of those qualities by ranking and grading our children and constantly telling them what to do. 

>The adolescent identity crises that plague American teen-agers aren’t an issue for hunter-gatherer children. The Westerners who have lived with hunter-gatherers and other small-scale societies speculate that these admirable qualities develop because of the way in which their children are brought up: namely, with constant security and stimulation, as a result of the long nursing period, sleeping near parents for several years, far more social models available to children through allo-parenting, far more social stimulation through constant physical contact and proximity of caretakers, instant caretaker responses to a child’s crying, and the minimal amount of physical punishment.”

  I've just found this subreddit, and I'm so grateful! I'm a new mum to (almost) 4 month old twin girls, though their adjusted age is closer to 3 months, and though I don't really have a label for the way I'm trying to raise them, attachment parenting seems to fit the best.  

When my husband and I go out together, we wear them in Tula carriers, and I breastfeed them as much as I can.  Sadly, when I'm out by myself it's a stroller and due to some really awful events soon after they were born I've never really been able to exclusively breastfeed as I wanted to. Making enough milk just seems to be beyond me.  

My principal reason for posting is that I want to reach out to anyone with twins, or even just seasoned mums as my husband and I are doing this without the help of any family members and are living fairly isolated from our friends.  

I'm not really sure what I should be expecting, sleep wise, so does anyone have any tips or experiences on this?  I'm really just hoping to find in this subreddit someone to turn to and ask questions when I'm not sure I'm doing the right thing.  Thanks for reading :)

Baby crying tears me up... aka boob is not a last resort,AttachmentParenting,10,2mea0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/2mea0j/baby_crying_tears_me_up_aka_boob_is_not_a_last/,20,1416104361.0,"DH told me he needs me to be able to handle baby crying without getting emotional, and he's frustrated that there seems to be a ""timer"" in me when the baby starts crying before I start to ""lose it,"" too. He says I need to steel myself and detach, basically, because babies cry, and not always for good/solvable reasons, and I need to be able to handle that, because otherwise if I let it get to me I'll be irrational.

On my side of things, if the baby is crying and DH is usable to console by changing diaper, distracting, changing position, giving a finger to suck on, etc, then I want to breastfeed him because that WILL calm and comfort the baby. If DH wants to hold onto the baby and keep trying to console, he needs to be doing more than sitting there gently rocking him and saying ""it's okay."" Give me the baby, and let me comfort him, the baby needs me....He doesn't need to cry and get all stressed and worked up when I have the solution. Boob is not a last resort. And it's completely normal for a new FTM to get emotional when her baby is crying and she can't console him - either because he won't be consoled our because daddy doesn't want to hand him over!

Easy peasy. We have no trouble at all getting her to fall asleep. 

Staying asleep is a whole different story!

We stopped swaddling her at around 2.5 months because my bed is squishy and I wanted her to be able to roll if she wanted/needed to. But now I spend easily an hour cumulatively every night pinning her arms down so she stops smacking herself and doesn't wake up/stays asleep. 

It isn't the reflex any more, she no longer jumps like crazy when startled while asleep. Instead her face crumples and her hands and arms start to flap, reach, grope, scratch, claw, grasp... you get the idea. They can be contained a lot of the time by tucking a blanket over her so she can grab that instead of her own face, but of course she isn't supposed to be sleeping with blankets. 

I have resorted to swaddling her again for the first half of the night so I can get a solid block of sleep (usually four to six hours <3) but I feel guilty about it because she obviously hates it and is miserable as she falls asleep. I have to release her arms after her first feed of the night because she will panic and fight the swaddle.

Edit/Update: The most recent time that we used a sitter, it was an experienced mother that had spent time with LO on multiple occasions. We felt that our leaving LO was a bit abrupt and this caused LO distress (they were never alone together prior to our absence). Reportedly during our absence, LO would alternate between playing contentedly and crying. My husband's and my instinct is to have a nanny or mother's helper type come in and visit with LO until LO is comfortable (perhaps an hour a week or so with us present). Then LO's comfort level will dictate when we are able to leave our home. I'm so glad that your advice generally supports our instincts. Thanks for all of the advice, it is truly appreciated!"

Then bedtime happens. My husband and I are at breaking point. Last night it was a 4 hour battle to put them both to bed, and after my patience reached its end I yelled at my 2 year old.  I wanted to just leave the house and clear my head, but I knew my husband would fare worse without me. 

A little info about sleep: My 2 year old had always been a good sleeper once he's asleep, but he had never gone to sleep just because he was tired, he had always needed to be intentionally put to bed. He slept in a co-sleeper next to our bed for a year, then moved to a crib, then we removed the side to make it a toddler bed. None of these transitions caused major problems. However, getting him asleep is a nightmare.

Here's what we've tried:

- consistent bedtime routine: bath, teeth, books, cuddle, bed.  Been in place since he's been about 1.
- 100 walks: takes several hours, with lots of tears, tried consistently for several weeks, did not improve.
- holding him until he's asleep- sometimes takes hours, lots of wiggles, often requests to go to bed where he either wiggles or gets up saying he's done napping.
- staying in his room as he fell asleep: can take hours, wiggles, gets up saying he's done napping.
- moving bedtime earlier - no change
- Moving bedtime later - shorter fight, but less sleep overall makes a grumpier toddler.
- Moving naptime earlier -only works if he's super tired from not getting enough sleep, otherwise we just have naptime battle too.
- shortening nap time- this seems to help shorten the battle, but he's grumpier all afternoon.

** note that we tried each strategy for a couple weeks to see if consistency helped.

I am willing to try to find what he needs to help going to sleep be a positive experience,  But can't handle these battles when they're disrupting our younger son's sleep as well. What we're doing is clearly not working, and we don't know what else to try, help?"

Hello!

I also posted in r/velcrobabies. 


My husband and I have a 6 month old baby girl who we've been basically APing. I quit my job to stay at home with her and we recently relocated to DC from TX (hubs is in the Air Force). Our baby sleeps with us, naps on me (wakes up when I leave the bed or try to transfer her to her crib or pack and play) and is generally content playing independently as long as she can still see one of us. It's been great, except for when I have to take a shower or drive anywhere with her. She screams the entire time I'm in the shower and every time we put her in the car for more than a 5-10 minute drive.



I feel like the car issue is unavoidable and we try to cut back on the amount of time she's in there when possible. Regarding the shower... Well, I like to shower - everyday. Usually I can do this while my husband holds her but not anymore. He is traveling a lot for his job and will be gone for days to weeks at a time.



Yesterday, I put her in her pack and play for 20-30 mins while I showered and got dressed. It was GLORIOUS until I realized that she was screaming the entire time. She doesn't self sooth or fall asleep she just screams. Is this ok? Am I going to traumatize her if I do this daily (I can cut back on the amount of time I'm gone too)? It breaks my heart, but what can I do?



Thanks for reading this and sorry if it's stupid but I'm a first time mom thats trying to do a better job than my parents did. Any advice would be helpful!



Tl;dr is it ok to leave a 6 month old baby in the pack and play/crib for 30 mins to shower and dress if she screams and cries the whole time or am I traumatizing her?"
Still nursing to sleep at 17 mo. Not cool!,AttachmentParenting,8,2gtovm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/2gtovm/still_nursing_to_sleep_at_17_mo_not_cool/,17,1411122785.0,"I've searched around (a lot) for advice and a solution to the problem of my superhero preemie still nursing to sleep at 20 mo (he was 3 mo premature so that makes him 17 mo adjusted).  I've tried everything and the only things that have ever gotten him to sleep are 1.)nursing (until completely asleep so that the nipple falls out of his mouth) and 2.)riding in the car seat. Patting, rocking, and nursing-until-drowsy all result in angry crying, which I don't allow. 

I know the simple answer is to practice with patting, rocking methods etc, but I don't let him cry for two reasons: 1.) I personally don't want him crying when he obviously and simply wants to nurse and 2.) I have an older child who is a light sleeper and I'm the the sole caregiver (most nights) to both. I can't have the little one waking the older one... ever, lest I would get no sleep, day or night.  

I currently bedshare with him as he happily nurses all night, not disturbing the older child in another room. Lately, during late night dream feeds, I can pop him off, quickly roll him and hug him in tightly for a momentary thrashing before he falls asleep. It doesn't sound like much, but it's been amazing to be able to limit his nursing and get some sleep. I'm hoping this is a signal that he's ready to practice sleeping without the human pacifier.  For heavens sake, he's almost 2 so he's got to be ready to fall asleep on his own, right? 

What's the next step to get him sleeping on his own?"

 I love AP. That is what I would naturally choose if there wasn't a name for it. But one time I was reading a review of some AP-ish book and in the comments there was someone who said at their church they have 2 small groups: an AP one (don't remember the book they go through) and another, maybe a baby wise one(?). Anyway they said they can always tell which kids were in the AP one because their kids talk back and don't obey as well in kids church. While I think that was odd, I also don't care necessarily how my 8 year old will act in Sunday school. What I am interested in as a parent is is my way of parenting preparing them to be a healthy, well adjusted adult or not. So I am curious as to how your adult (18+) turned out being raised with AP. Maybe even if some of you have children you didn't raise that way and some you did, what are the differences if any?
I realize that no matter what you do, most kids turn out ""fine,"" but I want to hear stories. Thanks!

My daughter sleeps just fine if I wear her but that's not a solution must days lately (I've tried my moby, maya asking, and even my beco carrier - all too warm) I can nap with her but she needs more than one nap and I'm not able to take every nap with her.

If I try to put some rules I find it difficult to deal with my baby's protest (getting angry, screaming and crying) and I often let her do as she wishes instead. At the same time, I don't want to be too weak either, I want her to know that I'm the grown up who is in charge of the situation. I don't want her to believe that she may do as she wants, as this is most likely overwhelming and scary for her too. 
Today for example, at bedtime she refused to go to bed. I knew for sure that she was very tired but she kept trying to get up and go out of the bedroom to play. I finally decided to not let her do that. I though we could stay in bed, sing, read or whatever, but in bed. She became sooo upset and threw a tantrum. I stayed with her, recognized her feelings, explained them to her, talk to her softly and said that it was time to sleep. She kept trying to leave and I kept putting her back to bed. She was angry and cried for a while. After 15 min or so, she calmed down and I nursed her to sleep.
But I really don't know if this was ok. I mean, how do I lay down some discipline in a warm, loving way. Is it ok that she gets so upset? Would it have been worse if I let her go, and avoid the drama?"

I'm trying to let her and daddy get closer by giving them alone time to hang out. I would like her to be secure attached to her father (and to me too!) but everytime I leave them she will scream and cry and look at me with those eyes... Yes, those eyes! As she was devastated. Then when I come home again (after a couple of hours) she just looks at me, not super excited, not too glad, I think she is upset at me.
Agh! This is too difficult, if it was for me, I wouldn't leave her, but I think it's good for her to get close to her father too. Two attachment figures better than one right? I don't know what to do, should I still try to give them time alone despite the crying? "

My 6mo has never slept through the night. She is EBF and not on solids. She's never taken a bottle.


A typical night goes

6.30 - 7pm nurse to sleep or until drowsy. If not asleep she's put in her cot to fall asleep with pink bunny. Maybe some bum patting.

8-9pm up for a quick feed maybe a burp, maybe just a cuddle. Straight back to sleep. 

11pm - feed, back to sleep

1-2am - feed, back to sleep

4-5am - feed, back to sleep 
 
7.30 up for the day.

Sometimes I can be up every hour between midnight and 4am. Sometimes it's every 45m from bedtime until midnight. 

She sleeps in a cot in her own room as it's not safe for me to co-sleep. Her room is warm enough, dark, has white noise and she has beloved pink bunny. 

I don't mind the sleep deprivation (well I do but it's secondary) as much as the thought that by not teaching her to self settle I'm doing the wrong thing.

I think that even though she's up ever 2-3 hours her overall sleep is probably fine. She takes good naps usually during the day. 

I'm starting to lose confidence as I see all these happy babies around me whose parents have trained them to sleep through and also... I'm pretty tired.

Talking to your daughter about weight,AttachmentParenting,4,2a8kkm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/2a8kkm/talking_to_your_daughter_about_weight/,15,1404942172.0,"So, this is about an older kid, so not sure how many here many be thinking about this yet, but I have an eight year old (almost nine), who I've been noticing has been gaining a bit of weight recently.  I was overweight as a kid and have continued to struggle with that into adulthood, so I know how difficult it is to combat.  At the same time, I don't want to set her up for a life of dieting, body image issues, or even worse - eating disorders.  I want to approach things delicately with an emphasis on her being healthy.

Some background.  She's always had a great appetite, but until last December was in an outdoor-based school where she got a ton of exercise every day.  We had to switch to a regular public school in January and so she doesn't get near the amount of exercise.  This summer she is not going to any sports camps, they are more art-type camps, so again, not a huge amount of activity.  She's also gotten more into playing games on a non-activated phone she has recently, and even though we've set limits, I wonder how much she is actually adhereing to them, or whether we need to make the limits lower.

The other piece to this is that she is a pretty picky eater.  Luckily she doesn't like any sweet baked goods (cookies, cakes, etc.), but she does love bread, tortillas, pasta, ice cream, pizza, smoothies, watermellon, and chocolate.  She likes some meats, but not many veggies, with the exception of salad and frozen veggies (peas, greenbeans mostly).  It is a challenge to say the least to feed her, and she also seems to want to eat on a fairly constant basis - at least when she's in the house.

So I guess, I'm wondering both about talking to her about being overweight, but also about ways we can figure this out as a project.  She's actually seen me lose a significant amount of weight (about 35lbs) in the last 5 months, but she knows that previously I struggled.  My wife has also struggled with her weight and currently should probably lose a good 25 lbs or so.

My main goal is not to make this about looking good for herself or anyone else, but really all about health, and really that's all I care about.  I've tried to find resources online to help with this but so far have come up empty-handed, so if anyone can either point me to some good resources or provide some good advice, I'd love to hear it.

I know she is not missing anything. She eats great, and my partner gives her so much love, affection, and snuggles!
Here is my problem. I have been on this shift for 3 nights (this is my fourth). Yesterday, she became extremely attached to a little stuff doll. She freaks out if she doesn't have it in her hands. She woke up when I got home last night and stayed up for hours. Before I went to work today, she would only put the doll down when I held her, and she wanted to be held all day long. 
Is she looking to the doll for comfort? 
I'm so scared that she feels like I have left her. Is it good that she is doing this..... is she maybe using this doll to self soothe?

Turns out he had/has very low iron! That would explain the constant irritability. I began to see improvements almost immediately after increasing his iron consumption and introducing an iron supplement.  He's 14 months and now like a different child.   He's still does that thing where he gets cranky with me but happy for everyone else, but it feels at a normal level now.

Not sure why it didn't occur to me earlier to see if he was lacking something as his irritability had been ongoing for months.

I guess I kind of thought it was something I was doing wrong, but clearly not.  Anyway, something to think about if your child has been not him or herself!"

I have an 8mo breastfed son who is currently bedsharing with us. He is starting to get more mobile and this may constitute moving him to his crib.

He sleeps very well with us, falls asleep breastfeeding and usually goes 12 hours with minor interruptions (not always but mostly). How can I peacefully transition him to a crib? We also do not have room for it in our room, so that is not an option. I struggle getting him to nap in it, and any attempts usually result in endless crying.

My toddler sleeps on her own!,AttachmentParenting,28,1xmaoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/1xmaoi/my_toddler_sleeps_on_her_own/,10,1392162103.0,"Last night I was able to put my toddler down to sleep and walk out the door and she went to sleep without fussing.

I know it doesn’t seem like much, but it’s a huge milestone for us.

I have been attachment parenting from the beginning.  I started cosleeping around day 3 when I realized that my baby simply would not sleep without a boob nearby.  We kept that up and did pretty OK during the night time for the most part.  She would nurse to sleep, and I could sleep in that same position.  I got a pretty sore back over the months, but it worked out.

The trouble was I had to go to bed at the same time as the baby.  I couldn’t unlatch and be an adult for a few hours.  Same deal with naptime – she simply Would Not Sleep on her own.  I work, and she managed to nap with grandma and at daycare, but she out and out refused to do so if I was within the same building.  Everybody I knew would scold me for not getting my baby to sleep, that I just had to be strong.  But everything we tried to make that happen just went against all my instincts, and I kept going back to cosleeping.

As she transitioned from baby to toddler she began to stay awake while nursing.  My only magical sleep solution of boob was no longer working!  In desperation I tried everything I could think of.  I even tried cry-it-out a little.  It wouldn’t work.  She would be so upset that if she did eventually fall asleep she would wake up in a half hour gasping because she was so worked up.  At about 18 months we settled into a new routine – we moved a crib into our bedroom, and she would sleep in there but only if I stayed in the bed next to her.  If I read a book or looked at my phone she would stay awake.  I had to pretend to sleep (or actually sleep) and she would eventually lay down and do the same.

So here we were for another several months – napping and going to bed at the same time.  It wasn’t so bad – I get up early for work so going to bed with baby wasn’t that awful.  

Then it happened.  Last week I was laying in the bed for naptime and she was happily playing in her crib not even attempting to sleep.  I got exasperated, got up and said “Night night!” and walked out.

And she didn’t cry.

And she went to sleep.

Same thing that night.  I tucked her in, sat for a couple of minutes, then just left.

And she didn’t cry!

And she went to sleep!

We are now a few nights in and I feel so proud.  I managed to achieve an almost-2 year old who will lay down and sleep without crying without fussing and I didn’t have to punish or scold or let her cry, or any of that.  It was a crazy number of hours of lying there with my baby, but looking back it was the right thing for us.

My son is 6mo old. We are currently CoSleeping and have been since he was around 4mo. Before that, he slept in the cradle by my bedside.  Even from 4-5.5mos, it seemed that I could get him to sleep part of the night or at least a few good naps in the cradle, but now...

Now I have to be laying right next to him for him to sleep. Naps. Nighttime. Everything. I can't get up to use the restroom at night, because he wakes. This is causing havoc to my mental state because I can't seem to get a single thing done. On top of that, I can barely put him down during the day.  I'm lucky if I get to wolf down a meal standing up while he winds up to cry.  

I don't know what this could be.  Is this a growth spurt? Is it just teething? Did I reintroduce dairy into my diet too soon? (He isn't showing the same symptoms as before that pointed us to a dairy intolerance.) 

I don't know what I am looking for besides a sympathetic audience, but if you have suggestions or advice, I'm all ears. 

UPDATE: As it always goes with kids, I was upset last night so, of course today I am able to slip away at nap.  Darn kid! He snoozed on his own (still in my bed, but baby steps...) for an hour and a half. I'm happy with that! "

He doesn't cry or have a care in the world when I'm not around. 

I had a nap at my mother in law's the other day and when I woke up I sat by the window and watched him playing outside for a long time with my MIL, not even sniffling when he fell. The second I stepped outside he began crying and wouldn't leave my side.  When he was comfortable enough to return to play he began whining every minute or so, for example if his toy got stuck, or if I took one step away.

I remember my oldest did this as well but not at this scale. I know the crying upon my return is normal behaviour too, but I guess what gets me is the constant crying and whining. After a day at home I am ready to start crying with him. I can't even pee without him on my lap.

My son is 5.5 months and for the last two months he has woken three or four times in the night.  He insists on feeding each time he wakes.  He is difficult to put back down.  Enter the NCSS.  It sure sounds great: AP-friendly yet has a concrete plan.  I've made my plan and have been following it for about a fortnight.  The two biggest elements for me are to move away from his feeding-to-sleep association, and to help him to learn to fall asleep by himself.  


I am having real problems following the plan.  He can fall asleep in one second flat while feeding.  For example, his feeding slows down so I take him off, he fusses, put him back on for ten seconds, he feeds slowly, take him off, he fusses, put him back on and after just a second  or two he is asleep.  And in the middle of the night I'm so half-asleep that I often don't notice until suddenly he's asleep. 


Unfortunately he transfers pretty badly - putting him in the cot is a great big wake-up-now! cue for him.  With helping him to fall asleep by himself I'm supposedly on phase one (putting him down sleepy, rocking him in the cot for a few minutes and then letting him drift off).  Really I'm on phase zero: rocking him to sleep, gently putting him down, rocking him back to sleep in the cot, gently removing my arms once he's asleep.  And usually I have to repeat this several times over, with the hairdryer going, in order for him to fall asleep and stay asleep.  


The book says to keep on keeping on.  But I am finding the sleep deprivation to be a huge challenge and I often feel overwhelmed. 


If you've used the NCSS, did you find it helpful or not?  Did you find it feasible to follow the steps?  Does my baby sound normal or like he needs something more than a tired mum following a book?  If you were dealing with similar situations to what I've described, what worked for you?  Many thanks!


(The cot is in our room.  We have tried co-sleeping for a few nights and while we slept better, for some reason it was hell on my back.  My husband is recovering from back surgery and I just can't risk two bad backs in the family.  So co-sleeping is out for me.)  "

We talked alot about how we wanted to raise our son before we even really heard of AP and found it basically described our pre-existing philosophy, so it sort of came to us more than we came to it. 

Still we have learned alot from books and online in recent months and are grateful to know there is a like-minded community and movement of sorts. 

What I am wondering is this: did those of you who did AP from day one find your experiences seemed anecdotally very different from parents with other philosophies? I keep wondering, for example, if our stress will be reduced because we simply have purchased so much less stuff. And I wonder if co-sleeping means our sleep will be even a little more peaceful. 

I guess I just have the lingering suspicion that the modern child-rearing phenomenon, in which a couple becomes stressed-out, world-detached zombies for a year just doesn't make sense. It almost simply must be a modern invention or the entire world would go mad.

It used to be a quick nurse, a bit of walking around and I could pop her in the crib. That has degenerated to the point where, last night, she didn't leave my arms once. Not once. I couldn't put her down, hand her off or even move away from her in bed (I took her into bed with me to try to get some sleep). I simply do not know how to deal with this - I don't even know where to start. 

Right now she is upstairs with my husband screaming her head off because he's trying to get her down into her crib - something that she did without any problems for weeks (months, even) every night at bedtime. But over the past few months, she's just become more and more and more needy, needing more soothing to get to sleep. I have walked and rocked her for up to 2 hours and she'll still not be all the way asleep, or let her nurse for 45 minutes. It's truly awful, and I know it's not doing her any favors either. But I don't know how to start breaking these sleep associations so that she can begin to get better at self-soothing. 

Everyone I talk to just tells me to let her cry it out, which we do NOT want to do. Isn't there another way? Has anyone dealt with this and come through the other side? Any books/websites/DVDs you can recommend? Please help. 

TL;DR: 2-year-old is extremely clingy and needy at night; mama is about to die of exhaustion. Also my nipples might fall off. "

In our living room we have a soft couch, a leather loveseat and an antique wooden rocking chair. For experienced moms, does this sound reasonable?

I work in childcare right now and I already have experience with babies and I feel like I have pretty good instincts. 

However it bothers me to NO end that most of the parents who bring their kids there are believers in so called ""sleep training"" and claim to have spent hundreds of dollars trying to get their kids to go to sleep on their own. 

Today one of the mothers was complaining that her child wasn't sleeping enough and was trying to figure out what she could do to help him go to sleep. When I suggested that we rock him to sleep she looked at me like I wanted to hang her baby up from the ceiling. 

I just DO NOT UNDERSTAND why some people insist on letting their baby ""cry it out"" aka scream for sometimes up to 30-40 minutes when if you rock them they will go to sleep in 5 minutes flat....what is better for your child? 5 minutes of peaceful snuggles that allow you to drift of to sleep feeling safe and secure...or 40 minutes of stressful screaming in a crib alone by yourself. 

I JUST DON'T GET IT!

The worst part is...she totally knows he loves to be rocked...but refuses to do it, and I really don't even think she has a good reason other than ""that's what your suppose to do""

Worst Parent Ever...

Disclaimer: I'm pretty hormonal right now too...but still. Thanks for letting me vent...

Edit: I know I'm being a total judgmental bitch right now, and so that is why I came here to vent. Don't confuse that with how I act towards people in my job.

Whether you breastfed or formula-fed, your responses are welcomed. 

If you’ve never had a concern about your milk supply, please imagine how you would respond if you did. Your feedback will help me determine how my products can best help nursing mothers. 

If you're not comfortable sharing your answers here, feel welcome to PM me. Thanks so much for your support!

1. How long did you breastfeed your child[ren]? If you did not breastfeed your child[ren] or you stopped before you desired, what were the reasons behind this decision? If you are currently breastfeeding, how long would you like to breastfeed?

2. Did/do you have concerns about your milk supply? If so, what resources did you turn to for help?

3. Have you used any products to help increase your milk supply? What did you try and did you notice any improvement from their use?

4. Here are some things that we think are a benefit to using a lactation aid - which would be important to you in deciding to use one?:
-it works             
-avoiding or using less formula              
-it’s not a drug, is made from natural ingredients
-my doctor told me about it         
-I feel like I would be doing the best for my baby            
-it’s a prescription drug
-another mom told me it worked for her               
-my doula/midwife/lactation consultant suggested it
-I don’t have to worry or stress about my milk supply       -other:_________________________________

5. If you were interested in an edible lactation aid, would you prefer a sweet treat like a cookie, or something more healthy like a granola bar?

6. What would make you more likely to buy lactation cookies over other aids?

7. If the cookies give you an increase in supply you’re satisfied with, how important are the following:
-taste    
-dairy-free     
-no artificial flavors/colors     
-natural preservatives     
-use of organic ingredients

8. If lactation cookies give you the increase in supply you desire, how much money would this be worth per day?

9. If a dairy-free cookie is important to you, would using organic non-hydrogenated palm oil versus regular vegetable shortening affect your decision to buy? Why or why not?

10. Are there any particular designations that would increase your likelihood of purchasing lactation cookies? Would any of these designations be something you would be willing to pay more for them? [Ex. gluten-free, organic, dairy-free, no preservatives, no artificial flavors or colors, etc]

11. If you were to purchase lactation cookies in the future, would you prefer to receive a weekly order, a monthly order, and/or individually-wrapped cookies to keep in a purse or diaper bag to eat on-the-go or while at work?

12. How important is it to you that this product is available locally or are you comfortable receiving it by mail?

13. If ordering online, would you prefer a lower price to receive the cookies in 7-10 days, or would you be willing to pay a higher price to get them in 3-4 days?  How much more would you be willing to pay to receive them faster?

Is there anything else you’d like to share that hasn’t been mentioned in the above questions? I appreciate any feedback you can provide."

Our now 3-4 months old daughter is obviously exclusively breastfed, has never been away from both of us at the same time (has only been away from me for 3 hours all together and I missed her like crazy), we haven't found anyone ""good enough"" to sit her, so this is just how it is, she often naps in the carrier or wrap during the day, but sleeps beautifully in her own bed, right next to me at night, she wears cloth nappies, but communicates so well, that we often take her to the toilet for pooping as that is what she prefers..
We are the strange parents without the pram, and I love our way of parenting!"

However, I have no clue how to go about finding daycare providers, especially ones who are cool with attachment parenting, natural parenting, etc.  We cloth diaper and practice AP, both of which are important to me and which.  If I use daycare, I want to ensure that my kid goes to an environment that is similar to the one that he gets at home.  We have no family close by, so that's not an option.

I was thinking that I'd just figure it out, but I woke up crying last night after having a nightmare where I went to pick up my son at daycare and he was being left to cry it out by the provider.  That is one of my worst fears.

So, for those of you who use daycare, how did you find your provider?  What questions did you ask?  "

Our first little one is due in September and we're trying to decide on the sleeping arrangement. Since we're two men, she will be bottle fed (hopefully with donated human milk).

Much of the advice out there on co-sleeping centers around the breastfeeding mother. 

We also live in a cold climate (Sweden) and usually sleep with a flat sheet on the bed and two separate duvets that have sheets on them the same way a pillow has a pillowcase. Our bed is massive (200cmx220cm) and fairly high up off the ground. 

We've thought about having an arm's reach co-sleeper or even [one of these](http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3977276) for the early months.

Any advice?

Edit: Sorry, I'm having trouble adjusting the terminology because I know beds here aren't set up the way they are outside of Scandinavia. The flat sheet is put around the mattress and secured beneath with clips. So we have one sheet that is secured that we sleep on top of and then we sleep beneath our own separate duvets that are each the size for one person not like the one big blanket American (and British?) method. Hope that helps!"

Basically I trust our bodies to heal and learn from each other. 

Another mother who loves her son more might be able to not practice AP and still provide a happy home for her son, but I am concerned that my son would loose if I don't, cause I don't know to express love, and I don't want him to feel the kind of abandonment I felt as a child, even though my parents loved me."

Any ideas how to get my son to sleep longer with me like he does with his grandparents?,AttachmentParenting,5,16p3a8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/16p3a8/any_ideas_how_to_get_my_son_to_sleep_longer_with/,6,1358388975.0,"Ok, here's the deal. For the past five months or so I've been actively trying to sleep train my son as gently as I can. I don't know how popular it is here, but it's definitely necessary for us, if I could just get it to work. 

I've always been the night parent because of my husband's issues. On top of his PTSD related sleep issues that keep us from being able to have our son in our bed, he also has a heart condition that causes him to blackout unless he's on his medication, which he can't take at night because it can cause hypertension, so he can't get up at night when my son cries, only me. I decided to try sleep training shortly before my son turned 1 at my husband's request with the No Cry Sleep Solution, but it wasn't working for us. I found [Dr. Gordon's technique](http://drjaygordon.com/attachment/sleeppattern.html) and decided to try it after he was a bit older. I tried with my son in his own room, but finally moved in onto a mattress on the floor with him because his cries in the middle of the night were causing my husband problems. I managed to get him night weaned fairly easily at least, but I can't get to the third stage in the least. Anyway, this arrangement with me in my son's room was all fine and good in the beginning, or so I thought, and my husband has been supportive, but apparently he has been sleeping worse and worse without me there to help calm him when he has any episodes at night. So both my son and husband need me at night. 

Now, whenever my son stays with my parents, he has no trouble sleeping for 9+ hours straight. But even after his recent 5 day trip with them (during which he slept all night every night) he came back to me and has only slept for 2-3 hours at a time, just like before.

I just don't know what to do. I keep waiting for the day when he suddenly reaches that milestone with me, hoping it's just right around the corner so that I can trust he'll sleep fine and be able to tend to my husband at the same time. I've tried hard not to have the expectation that he'd be sleeping through the night by now, but it's hard now that I know he will as long as I'm not tending to him. My parents are willing to have him stay with them nightly (the good thing in all of this is that we're currently living in their house, although in a whole separate area), but I'm worried he'll stay with them, sleep wonderfully, then come back to us and go right back where we are now.

Any ideas?

RSVP Advice Needed,AttachmentParenting,4,167rmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/167rmz/rsvp_advice_needed/,6,1357718974.0,"Hello like-minded parents!

I need some advice. I have a high needs son. He is four months old. To date, he has been rocked to sleep exactly three times - once by me, once by his grandmother, and once by his uncle. His father never has managed to do it. (My husband is a wonderful, warm and attentive father. He took the first month after the birth off work. My son loves him to bits. It just never gelled to get him to sleep. And my husband works long erratic hours with the only consistent time he can spend with our son being in the morning, so it's been hard to implement any sort of programme to make the daddy-soothing happen.) He has also been worn to sleep many times by his father, but in the last two months - he started to cry more on my husband after he went back to work, and I didn't want to damage their relationship by having him think his father was the man he got strapped to to cry himself to sleep. So in the last couple of months I've been the only one putting him to sleep -either by nursing or by wearing. 

At night we bed-share just him and me. We are going to try to introduce my husband into the mix now that he's a bit bigger and less squish-able, but it will probably have to wait a month until my husband isn't working crazy hours a work.

The question is - my friend is getting married in two months. I have to RSVP in a month. It is not a baby-friendly wedding or reception. I'll go to the ceremony either way, but I'm going back and forth on whether there is any way I can go to the reception. I guess I could do a test run ahead of time and see if my husband can get him to go to and stay asleep for a couple hours in the evening (If I did go, I'd leave him with his father and I'd only go to the dinner.), but that seems like it would just be moving the trauma forward. My gut is saying that I should skip the reception, I guess. But it just seems too lame to say that I can't go because I have a 6 month old baby. People tend to understand about newborns, but I don't think they'll really understand about an older baby.

Has anyone else had any experiences along these lines? What did you do? Do you regret your choice, either way?"

It took 90 minutes to get him to go to sleep and both Dad and I were at our wits end. Last night was the same and in both cases I have to leave for him to finally settle. That's fine (I guess) if Dad is home but if he's away we're in for a long drawn out process. 

We co-sleep and stay with him until he's asleep, but that process takes at least an hour from the time he gets in bed to when he's asleep. Once he's asleep he's out like a light but it just take forever for his brain to slow down. 

If he skips a nap he is usually a jerk by 4pm so I don't know that we're ready to change that (and he still naps at daycare).

If I stop to soothe her, it starts right back up when I put her back in her car seat. It seems to have gotten a little better as she's gotten older and adding a clip-on fan to her car seat helped also, but she still has car-seat meltdowns pretty regularly. She's been in other types of car seats and it makes no difference. I feel like I am essentially letting her cry it out every time we have to go anywhere and I feel just awful (it has also taught me that the CIO method would NOT work for my daughter since she obviously hasn't learned to like her carseat by now). I feel like I've tried everything, and that I'm being cruel to my baby by running errands or going to visit my family. I dread having to go anywhere and I'm becoming depressed and isolated. Please help me help my baby to not hate her car seat."

Balancing baby's wants/needs with my own,AttachmentParenting,10,uy1rs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/uy1rs/balancing_babys_wantsneeds_with_my_own/,17,1339543793.0,"As a new mom, I feel like I am constantly struggling with how to balance what my infant daughter wants or needs with my own wants and needs. I am striving to be a responsive, aware, engaged parent. But it is also important to me that I retain some measure of selfhood that is not solely defined by being a mother. 

I was thinking about all this earlier - my daughter had been fussing, so I lay down to nurse with her for an extra soothing treat. She fell asleep peacefully, and I struggled with whether I should risk waking her to get up, get dressed and wash my face (which I dearly wanted to do), or lie with her to ensure she got a good rest. 

Do others of you struggle with this balance? What has helped you negotiate between you own desires and those of your children?"

And he lays down and wiggles all around laughing. Or ""Please lie down here so I can change your diaper"" and he runs around the house laughing maniacally. Or ""Pick up the food you just threw and put it on the table.""  He is quite amused by his ability to not do what I ask. I try creative ways to give him choices, but sometimes it just does not work and I'm left wondering what to do when I give him a direct command (ooh, I don't like that word) and he does the opposite.  I want my words to have meaning, so I don't want him just ignoring my specific instructions.   I have done some reading about time outs, (I know that it is not an AP method), and if I were to start doing time outs I think I would save them for safety issues, which these are not.

My daughter is 3 months old and spends a great deal of her time in my arms or in a carrier. We do tummy time every day, and she sleeps swaddled at night. At this rate, I'm wondering how she will ever develop the skills to roll over from her back onto her tummy. I know that is probably a ways off, developmentally, but does anyone have any input on this? I've been experimenting with laying her on her back on a blanket for short periods - I took her out on the porch the other day when it was warm, and she had a blast watching the laundry blow in the breeze while I hung it up!

* cosleeping as long as baby wants
* breastfeeding as long as baby wants
* breastfeeding on demand
* babywearing

My definition of parenthood is one of 20 or more years of helping ones kids with their life. So I ask, what is AP after the kid can talk, has temper tantrums, maybe even hits puberty?

disclaimer: we use some parts of AP with our 16 month old son (still breastfeeding (5,5 months only BFing, now daily once, more or less), almost no use of a stroller (walking himself or being carried by my husband or me (without carrier, was too much hassle after 9-11 months)), we co-slept until he was circa one year old (but then we sort of let him CIO, sometimes he comes to us at nights or in the mornings (especially if we want to sleep longer than usual))

I'm interested in this, because I want to know different approaches of parenting to cherry-pick what suits my family best. And AP seems to disappear after 1-3 years of kids age"

I'm rather fond of attachment parenting, so that's why I'm posting here. 

I have a heart condition that I'd rather not name (it's rare, and I don't want to be identified). Long story short, certain things can aggravate it, and lack of sleep is a huge one. That factor alone can be the difference between a healthy day and a day where I physically cannot leave my bed. If I don't get enough sleep, bad things can happen. Not ""cranky, I-can-get-over-it"" bad, but physically might put me in a hospital if there are complications. 

All I ever hear from new parents is, ""don't expect to get any sleep for the first year!"" This terrifies me. I want to be a Mother, and I want so badly to co-sleep and bond with my child. Unfortunately, if I can't get enough rest, I'm not only putting myself in danger, but my child as well. 

Any advice from parents who have been there, done that? (And please don't say, 'don't have kids', or 'sorry, it's impossible'. That won't help me.) 

Thank you in advance! "
