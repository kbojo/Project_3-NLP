You can see in pictures insulation is exposed. Should I seal this up with plastic/duck tape until I can get someone to repair? What else do I need to do?

Edit: thanks for all the responses. All the rot is actually dry since we haven't had any rain in weeks and I removed a bunch and found that the bottom plate and studs of that exterior wall to the left of the bay window are basically totally rotted out so thinking this may be too serious for me to DIY as I have pretty limited experience.","Removed built in planters under bay window on deck and discovered wood rot through the siding and sheathing, need advicehttps://imgur.com/a/tEZSz3R

Basically I live in a new build flat with a 2 year old who is... Less than kind to the doors. He likes to play with the door handles, pulling them up and down etc.

His door handle has come loose. The handle itself goes slightly up now as going down like it should (moving the handle up also begins to draw the latch into the door, but only goes up maybe an inch.)

I've taken the faceplates off and all the screws connecting the unit to the door are secure, it's actually just the handle bit that's loose.

There's also a grub screw in the bottom of the handles both sides which I've also checked and are secure.

At this point I'm not really sure what else to try... Can anyone help?

Regulating the flame in a small homemade pellet burner,DIY,5,dgxscw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/dgxscw/regulating_the_flame_in_a_small_homemade_pellet/,4,1570928500.0,"I have a massive bag full of pellets I'm not using (we bought them as experimental cat litter, but we're back to actual litter for the feline so you can imagine how well that went), so I'm making a tiny pellet burner that I intend to use to [make popcorn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzPIZAieog4) or plausibly [boil small amounts of water for tea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvFPxrzxCUI).

As you do.

I have a cat food tin as a support and ash collector, with holes for air. On top of that I tried using [a different shape of tin](https://i.imgur.com/Rhg52g5l.jpg) with a lot of holes, but that worked too well - the pellets ignited readily, then really started going and produced a flame much too big for comfort. I tried to harness it controllably by drilling holes around the top of the tin and placing a container on it, but that just caused the fire to die and the pellets to emit a whole lot of smoke.

So I downsized the burner by using an inverted tin with a big hole in the middle as a support and a perforated tea candle to carry the pellets. This takes quite a bit more effort to start, but once it does catch (with the help of some alcohol) it [works well enough](https://i.imgur.com/9btJbrZl.jpg). Problem is, when it gets going the flame [gets too big](https://i.imgur.com/d7dLehEl.jpg) and exhausts the available fuel too quickly.

I need a way to limit the size of the flame without using an even smaller container, because that'd probably become too difficult to ignite. 

I thought perhaps a way to cover some of the air holes on the bottom tin might work? Though I'm not sure if it'd make them smoke or what. 

Any ideas?

Edit: I should mention, before you go all /r/osha on me, that during the course of this experimentation I had my window open and plenty of water ready to douse any wayward fires. And yeah, I know I didn't remove the protective layer on the first tin so it got all charred and black - I won't make that mistake again. Fortunately the candle tin isn't coated in any such crap.","Regulating the flame in a small homemade pellet burnerI have a massive bag full of pellets I'm not using (we bought them as experimental cat litter, but we're back to actual litter for the feline so you can imagine how well that went), so I'm making a tiny pellet burner that I intend to use to [make popcorn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzPIZAieog4) or plausibly [boil small amounts of water for tea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvFPxrzxCUI).

As you do.

I have a cat food tin as a support and ash collector, with holes for air. On top of that I tried using [a different shape of tin](https://i.imgur.com/Rhg52g5l.jpg) with a lot of holes, but that worked too well - the pellets ignited readily, then really started going and produced a flame much too big for comfort. I tried to harness it controllably by drilling holes around the top of the tin and placing a container on it, but that just caused the fire to die and the pellets to emit a whole lot of smoke.

So I downsized the burner by using an inverted tin with a big hole in the middle as a support and a perforated tea candle to carry the pellets. This takes quite a bit more effort to start, but once it does catch (with the help of some alcohol) it [works well enough](https://i.imgur.com/9btJbrZl.jpg). Problem is, when it gets going the flame [gets too big](https://i.imgur.com/d7dLehEl.jpg) and exhausts the available fuel too quickly.

I need a way to limit the size of the flame without using an even smaller container, because that'd probably become too difficult to ignite.

Will this be an issue? Subfloor wiggle under laminate wood,DIY,2,dh1k3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/dh1k3h/will_this_be_an_issue_subfloor_wiggle_under/,6,1570946233.0,"Installing laminate wood on the second floor and I found a spot where the 4' x 8' subfloor piece doesn't rest on the trusses beneath it, creating a little wiggle when stepped on.

[image of issue](https://s.put.re/Ypici84E.jpeg)

Wondering how to address this without ripping up the subfloor, as I'd have to rip up several pieces of subfloor as well as a bunch of drywall (at the very least, quite probably the drywall and framing as well which is not an option).

  


My thought is to place a touch of extra underlayment to give extra cushion to the part that depressed when stepped on.

I also considered using some floor-leveler - the type used to even out concrete floors - but I think the wiggle will destroy this over time.

I just can’t tell you how easy it is to make your bed look like this for about $160, depending on your sources for materials.  

You are going to need:
*Spray adhesive
*2 yards of any fabric of your choice for perimeter wrap
*1 lb. box of 3” screws
*ALL MEASUREMENTS ARE FOR 2x6 UNTREATED BOARDS (actual measurement 1.5”x5.5”)
*WILL NEED 1 UNTREATED 2”x4”x8’ FOR FRAME BRACING (cut into 10” pieces)
*BED FRAME MADE FOR QUEEN SIZE BED, MEASURING OUTSIDE DIMENSIONS AT 60”x80”, MADE TO BE FLUSH WITH THE BOX SPRING.

***FOUNDATION***
2 @ 36” {head and foot}
2 @ 65” {sides}
3 @ 33” {supports}
(As seen in time lapse) Screw in from the front of the head and foot board ((36” each)){labeled this for perspective}) into the side boards 65” ea.  Measure from the outside, on the edges to line up with the side boards, to 18”, 30”, &amp;amp;amp; 54” and place a mark for the spacing on your support boards inside of your foundation.  Screw your support boards in to the center of these marks.  This spacing provides 18” from the head and the foot, with 16” spacing in the two gaps in the middle to provide support for bodies that are sleeping.
LED light strips come with an adhesive backing.  I didn’t use this and instead for flexibility I simply used scotch tape to attach the lights to the foundation.  This allows me the ability to remove them easily if I move.
This may be somewhat out of order, but attach your frame braces (2”x4”, cut to 10” each) to the inside of your foundation.

***BED FRAME***
2 @ 60” (head and foot)
2 @ 77” (sides)
4 @ 57” (supports)
Measure your head board 12” from each side, line this up with the outside of your foundation side boards and attach to your braces.  57” support boards will be measured 10.5” from each end (to compensate for the side boards)...these will be 10.5” and 46.5”.  Line these marks up with the outside of your foundation and attach to braces.  Attach side and foot boards and you are likely close enough now that I don’t need to tell you to vacuum before you start showing us how you did it.  You’ve spent this much time, please leave me a comment.  Thanks so much for your time.

Clean up your perimeter any way you want to.  Fleece was easy to work with, spray adhesive was very easy as well.  Stain it any color you desire.  Leave it all natural.  Whatever is good, it’s done now.

This is my first YouTube video that I’ve really put some time in to.  I genuinely appreciate any comments you may have and any shares you may send.

Attach side and foot boards and you are likely close enough now that I don’t need to tell you to vacuum before you start showing us how you did it.  You’ve spent this much time, please leave me a comment.  Thanks so much for your time.

Clean up your perimeter any way you want to.  Fleece was easy to work with, spray adhesive was very easy as well.  Stain it any color you desire.  Leave it all natural.  Whatever is good, it’s done now.

This is my first YouTube video that I’ve really put some time in to.  I genuinely appreciate any comments you may have and any shares you may send.

I redid this old funky room off the side of my house,DIY,11,dgoeok,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/dgoeok/i_redid_this_old_funky_room_off_the_side_of_my/,7,1570872167.0,"So we have this weird room on the side of our house.  The room was part of an extension that added a master suite above it in the mid 70's, but because of the layout of the house, made it so that this room was only accessible from the garage or backyard.  Hence we never used it for pretty much anything except for storage....and really not much at that.

Ever since we moved in I knew that I eventually wanted to make it a home office / man cave since it would never be used as ""real living space"".  But, I also knew I had little funds to put towards this since it was more of a ""nice to have"" rather than a ""gotta have"".  So the entire renovation needed to be done on the frugal side. So anything that could be re-used or re-purposed would be.

Except for the drywall, mini-split installation and carpet installation.... I did all the work myself.  I am a desk jockey by day and don't have any construction background, but I have Reddit and Youtube and an endless supply of time.  I'm very happy with the final product.

In the process of the entire project, I really did not spend a lot for what I got out of it. 

**Major costs****:**

* I replaced a 40 year old wall mounted gas heater with a Mitsubishi mini-split.
* Drywall subcontractor.
* Carpet installation

**Minor costs**:

* 3 Andersen New Construction Windows (200 series)
* Lumber & Nails
* Paint
* Lighting
* Couple rolls of insulation
* Molding
* Pre-hung door

I say the entire project cost around $8-9k, but a good half of that was the mini-split. and another quarter was the drywaller and carpet.","I redid this old funky room off the side of my houseSo we have this weird room on the side of our house.

Washing Machine Microcontroller Monitor,DIY,2,dgpq70,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/dgpq70/washing_machine_microcontroller_monitor/,7,1570879394.0,"Hey everyone!

tl;dr - How can I wire up a [Particle Photon](https://docs.particle.io/datasheets/wi-fi/photon-datasheet/) or similar device up to my [washing machine](https://imgur.com/a/dacfsUX) safely?

The long explanation:

I have a project that my wife is hoping I'll be able to do. I'd like to wire up a Particle Photon/Arduino/Raspberry Pi to our washing machine, then connect that to a server I'll set up to send notifications to my wife's phone (via IFTTT or something probably). When it comes to the server, and the programming of the microcontroller, I have no problems. That's the easy part for me. I'm wondering how to wire this up properly so that I don't blow anything up.

This is the wiring that I can see for the washer, including a nice schematic: [https://imgur.com/a/dacfsUX](https://imgur.com/a/dacfsUX). I'd really like to be able to wire the controller so that I can have a status site that shows like, lid up/down, what the current cycle is, etc... so that it's a really comprehensive view of the status of the whole thing (as opposed to just a thing that monitors the light, like some DIYs I've read on this topic). I just want to like, monitor all the wires, but I'm concerned that direct connections will blow the controller, and I don't know how to avoid that.

Here is the smelter project that preceded this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/dgg1v9/built\_a\_smelterfurnace\_from\_an\_expansion\_tank/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/dgg1v9/built_a_smelterfurnace_from_an_expansion_tank/)

I bought chamotte plates, refractory cement and chamotte sand to create a good insulation.

The outermost layer of the furnace will be insulated with ceramic wool.

This should also compensate for the expansion and contraction of the metal so that it doesn't crack the cement.

[The first step was cutting the chamotte to size. I noticed that you can cut about halfway through and break it off cleanly with a hammer. That saved me a lot of work.](https://i.redd.it/382nw705dxr31.jpg)

&#x200B;

[Between this spacer on which the chamotte will sit and the burner there is just enough room for the plates to fit.](https://i.redd.it/sy0y4bfmdxr31.jpg)

[The chamotte is sitting on the spacer that you can see in the picture above.](https://i.redd.it/0q7o0robdxr31.jpg)

[The chamotte sand which I mixed with the cement about 2 parts cement and 3 parts sand.](https://i.redd.it/n8ycrg1aexr31.jpg)

[This cement was also used for hard to reach spots and seams.](https://i.redd.it/3l1b8bmfexr31.jpg)

[Before the concrete.](https://i.redd.it/475ybb3pjxr31.jpg)

[I used a piece of the leftover pipe as a core and wrapped it in plastic for easier removal. As mentioned the concrete mix was about 2:3. Don't know if that's the correct term to use here but I used only little water to create an 'earth-moist' mix and relied on tamping it into place. The cement filled nicely around the construction steel triangle, which will hopefully prevent it from falling out of the lid.](https://i.redd.it/zg00eerrixr31.jpg)

[Then I filled the bottom with my concrete mix and recycled the chamotte corners by embedding them down there. Placed the spacer and the chamotte plates, making sure to fill every nook and cranny with the fire cement from the tube.](https://i.redd.it/ip13a5dqexr31.jpg)

[The wool cuts like butter with a cutter knife.](https://i.redd.it/fadramk4gxr31.jpg)

[I cleaned up the visible parts and placed the ceramic wool. ](https://i.redd.it/x3l9y7gsfxr31.jpg)

The scribbles you see on the bottom are my many tries to get the plastic pipe (around which the cement will go) centered. In the end I just used a ruler and went around the perimeter of the pipe until I had evened it out.

For the plastic core to fit over the burner, I had to create a cutout in the corresponding size. I used a cutting disk for this which worked very well.

[The tank is wrapped to protect the paint. I wrapped some plastic foil around the core for easier removal. The core was secured in place with a piece of wood and two clamps carefully as not to move it off center.](https://i.redd.it/74p2ptsdhxr31.jpg)

[Filling it with concrete took quite a long time and lots of tamping but was very straightforward. A smooth finish was achieved with a small wet paint brush. Without using too much water you can close little gaps and pores in the surface and make it much smoother.](https://i.redd.it/ioxlj243ixr31.jpg)

The set time on the refractory cement is about 2 weeks although they recommend you wait longer than that.

If I forgot to explain something, please tell me.

I hope that posting this and the previous project will make it easier for them to construct their own ovens since casting metal is extremely fun. The furnace will definitely be able to melt aluminium but I do not know how high it'll be able to go.

Should I get a latch that can be opened from the outside too?  (I'll typically keep a snap on it preventing opening from the outside anyway so I'm thinking no)

I'm a very light sleeper and I'd rather not be constantly exposed to UVA and UVB when I'm in my room, but I can't paint over the skylights because I'm a renter. There's a company that makes blackout skylight covers, but just *one* of their skylight covers would be over $150 and I can barely make rent so I'm not sure I can justify dropping a couple hundred dollars on them. But, not getting sleep and being exposed to UV is also a big no. 

How can I cheaply shield my room (or at least my bed) from UVA, UVB, and sunlight that comes through several skylights? They're domed 2x4 skylights if that helps and the openings at the bottom of the skylights are 39""x62.5"".

I've seen some DIY skylight curtains on Pinterest, but those would require me to drill holes in the space below the skylight and as I'm renting, that's not an option. I've also looked at blackout window films, but all of the ones I've found are non-adhesive and wouldn't stay up if I put them on the interior of the skylights-- especially since the skylights are plastic, not glass. I don't know if it's possible to apply exterior window films that (and this is very important) can be removed after I move out in a year or two and if they were removable, how they would hold up to the elements or whether they'd stick to the domed plastic skylights. I've done some googling on this issue without success. I've thought about just taking tarpaulin and folding it until it blocks out the light and duct-taping it to the exterior of the skylights, but I think that would probably be an eyesore and my landlord probably wouldn't be a fan. 

If anyone has any suggestions on how I can affordably cover the skylights so I can sleep and avoid premature aging, please let me know. Also, I'm new to DIY projects, so something that doesn't require a great level of skill would be preferred. 

  
If this isn't the right subreddit for this sort of question, I'd really appreciate it if someone could point me in the right direction. Thank you!

I'm currently in the process of having my basement finished and figured, why the heck shouldn't I run some network cable.  We are currently waiting on the plumber and then will have the first inspection some time next week.  

My setup: I currently have my modem and router on the main floor in the living room.  I'm looking to get possibly three ports into two different rooms.  

I think I can figure out how to run the cable once I have a source in the basement.  But I can't seem to wrap my head around how to get the source down there.  If I cut a hole in the drywall next to an electrical outlet on the main floor, will I be able to drop a cable fairly easily down to the basement?  My thought was to put a jack on the main floor and run the cable into the basement and connect to a switch.  I could then plug my router into the wall to supply the switch with internet.  Then I would run the cables from the switch through the walls/ceiling in the basement to where I would want them.

Does that sound reasonable?  Am I missing something here?  The basement is being finished by several contractors so I don't want to step on their toes when it comes to the work they've already done. I also don't want to slow down the process by screwing this up and them needing to wait on me.

My boss was super chill and allowed me to use his tools for my own projects. He even helped me with tips & tricks here and there. Also a lot of the metal I used was stock he had lying around.

I started looking online for people's experiences with building smelters and, while you can definitely piece it together, I still found the amount of information lacking. Many people also built smelters for one time use with shabby materials which I didn't want to do.

So I improvised a lot and decided to add to the catalog of experiences, hopefully someone who wants to do a similar project can take something away from this. :)

All of the welding is TIG, most other things were done with an angle grinder. For flat stock and sheet metal I used a guillotine shear.

(Please don't be too harsh on the welding, everyone has to start at some point.)

[Used 40mm square pipe for the frame and cut everything to size with a table saw that hold the workpiece in place hydraulically.](https://i.redd.it/lt3sl96ktwr31.jpg)

[For the feet capped two shorter pieces and welded them shut.](https://i.redd.it/us1q6tzttwr31.jpg)

[Tacked it up first.](https://i.redd.it/792a2ayavwr31.jpg)

[Then welded it through.](https://i.redd.it/r0d5hra5vwr31.jpg)

[On the top one is the handle for the cart that I just bent with the torch. Below is the stainless steel \(1.4301\) tube that will become my burner.](https://i.redd.it/nrhxpa0kvwr31.jpg)

Someone told that for medium temperatures stainless steel is a good choice. It melts at around 1450°C. Since that's more than what the refractory cement is rated at, it will work.

Also the furnace will probably be nowhere near those temperatures.

[Had to cut out the rubber bladder that was in there. Strange smell.](https://i.redd.it/wpjjfbaiywr31.jpg)

[Used a wire wheel to get the paint off of the tank and some chemical agent for the hard to reach spots. During the wait for the paint to fall off I welded on these little brackets and drilled the corresponding holes into the frame. Also drilled a hole in the lid with a core drill.](https://i.redd.it/gcdg0erp0xr31.jpg)

I forgot to take photos during this step but I imagined some kind of hinge mechanism for the lid. Ended up having to bridge the gap between the frame and lid with construction steel and used some flat stock as the lever arms.

[It's kind of ugly but I had very limited choice in material. A triangle frame for the cement to grab onto was also added.](https://i.redd.it/ohpgv5ez0xr31.jpg)

[Made this pipe \('burner'\) crooked so that it will sit tangentially in the actual furnace. The drilled holes form a cutout where I added another pipe for extra air input. Used a dremel tool to connect all the holes and create the cutout.](https://i.redd.it/garcgt9k2xr31.jpg)

[Tank with the pipe in place.](https://i.redd.it/56g39dc45xr31.jpg)

[Welded the thing in there and closed a hole that the tank had originally with sheet metal from the outside.

Doesn't bear any load and is for leveling purposes only.](https://i.redd.it/ezk33inf3xr31.jpg)

At some point in the house's history an addition was put on that added a utility room and carport. The dumb fucks that put this addition on only stripped the siding off the (former) exterior wall where interior paneling was put up. Where the bottom frame of the utility room meets the bottom frame of the original house, they left both the tar paper (probably intended as a wind/draft barrier) and asbestos shingles. The door they put in was a pocket door with metal rails. So for the probably 30+ years that genius decision has allowed moisture to seep into the gap between the original frame and the exterior, which no longer can dry because the new frame sandwiched the shingles. 

Bringing us to 9 months ago, my house was hit by a flood. So after stripping out all the flooring and starting repairs/renovations, some of which i had been wanting to do but are the kind that are 10x more difficult in a house thats being lived in. So i found this problem during that, and of the original 2x10 about half of it has disintegrated into basically potting soil. I've removed all that, but the cavity left is irregularly shaped and varies in thickness from maybe .5"" to 1.25"" inches. I've shored up the opposite side of the beam (under the original house) for peace of mind. The question is what to do about this cavity. 

My idea, because i have used epoxy alot for boat repair, is to seal the inside edges of the cavity so it doesn't leak and just fill the fucker with epoxy. I can use slow curing epoxy to avoid it getting too hot using that volume, plus it's getting cooler now so that will help slow the reaction too. How would any of y'all go about repairing this issue?

I hope this is the right sub to post this. I used white Saral wax-free transfer paper and a ball point pen with medium-heavy pressure. The original plan was to then use an acrylic paint pen over the trace, but I really like how this turned out (the acrylic pen, even with a chisel edge, also makes it really difficult to get the intricate details right.)

The question is: Will this survive two weeks until the date as well as transport? I'm able to rub off surface smudges with a little effort, whereas the traced letters are grooved into the wood and seem more protected. Should I leave it as is? Would a clear/glossy spraypaint protect the lettering? Does anyone have experience with this transfer paper?

We live in a single level home with a small basement. The basement is below an addition that was built by the previous owner in the 1990s. This addition does not have HVAC venting, so we recently installed an electric fireplace which has worked to keep the room warmer since our weather recently started chilling down.

The basement has a minor moisture problem that stems from our sump pump failing a few months ago. We don't have consistent flooding but we do use a dehumidifier on a regular basis. The basement has no insulation in the joists or the walls.

My wife believes we are losing heat in that room because of the basement's lack of insulation, though heat rises.

So, would you insulate the joist bays and rim joists in this situation? Fiberglass or foam board? Or just forget about it? The room is pleasantly warm with the electric fireplace running.","Insulating a BasementI have a rather specific scenario, and I could use some help.

These days, individuals have cell phones with them constantly. So it bodes well to utilize these to control their homes. Displayed here is a framework utilizing a straightforward Android application, which I made and used  to control electrical apparatuses with snaps or voice directions. Instructions are sent by means of a module to Arduino Uno. You need to rest and control everything at one point.

Components

A blue too module that I ensured that it supports master slave serial transfer of data. It is used to send data from mobile phone to the devices

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/otvxl03i4yr31.jpg

Arduino uno for programming. A board that is programmed to control the devices

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/osx0adej4yr31.jpg

Relay module that I used to turn on and off devices. These are devices which use low currents to control larger currents

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/2fruhf3l4yr31.jpg

Schematics

You can simulate the schematics using the Arduino simulator and connect the devices as follows. It is a free software available online. Connect the Arduino board to the computer.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/o8o9xaem4yr31.jpg

Software

There are two forms of software. The one running on Arduino board and the one running on the mobile phone. Go to google play and download home automation. Also, download Arduino software and install to your computer. Open the Arduino Arduino IDE upload the software to the Arduino IDE.

Operation

Open the home automation application and you will be able to send the data to the board and from the board to the relays which will turn on lights and anything else connected to the board. In my case, I was using high current bulbs

Another Pompeii Pizza Oven,DIY,0,dgfe0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/dgfe0f/another_pompeii_pizza_oven/,2,1570830283.0,"Howdy, everyone.

[https://imgur.com/a/9ouNibC](https://imgur.com/a/9ouNibC)

It all started when I, being a pizza lover, was looking for another recipe on the Internet and I came across a video on the Pompeii oven.

Dashing pizza guy cheerfully beat up a piece of dough, spun it on handles and, generously snapped the sauce, sprinkled cheese and other mozzarella stuff. By the way, he hasn't generously poured the cheese, but can they do it in that way? Well, that’s not a secret. It is in the moment of preparation. The video was recorded without breaks, and from the moment of pushing the pizza in the oven until it’s ready, it took less than 2 minutes. If more precisely, 97 seconds. I never thought it could be so fast. I searched in Google for the Pompeii oven. As a result, the longest cooking time I found was less than four minutes. While I was watching videos on youtube, I found out that in this oven you can cook almost anything. I immediately remembered my childhood, my grandmother's stove, roasted potatoes and cast iron soup. There's no gas in my cottage and I was bored with the multicookers. “You have to pull yourself together and start sculpting” came to my mind.

Since my experience in the stove industry is zero days, I've been preparing for the construction for a long time. I surfed stove master forums and other house forums. Eventually, I realized that I could not build a hemisphere of bricks with my own hands. The number of sawn bricks in a wedge and the manufacture of complex adjacent elements of the chimney immersed me in despair. As a result, I came to the conclusion that I need to hire specialists.

The stovemen wanted a lot of money. I refused. All right, let's think about buying a finished oven. Prices for the smallest (60 cm diameter) started at $1000...

But the desire to eat tasty food was buried under the indestructible arguments. I became obsessed with the idea. I admit it took some time.....

Eventually, while I was reviewing the posts by various MacGuyvers on the internet and r/DIY, I came across a guy who offered me a Pompeii stove kit for a reasonable price. Eventually, the vault, the bottom and the chimney were the separate elements. The money they wanted was about 500$. But some delivery shenanigans stopped me.

In short, I refused this option and eventually found a guy nearby, making a similar stove builder of refractory concrete. The price with the delivery did not exceed the same price, the dude lived not so far, so I decided. I'll take it.

I called and ordered it. I was informed that the oven would be paid on my order. That is, they are not ready to store it in the warehouse, and I will have to wait a week - two. Well, ok, I thought. I'll make a booth for that. We bought concrete blocks 40x20x20x20 (actually, something about 18x19x19x38. There are also fittings, claydite, mesh and 2 types of mixtures (stove and cement sand). I worked on weekends, sometimes in the middle of the week in the evening.

Whew. I think now I can share how it turned out.

[The result](https://i.redd.it/m9c5xai5zwr31.jpg)

[Testing](https://i.redd.it/kpyy34olzwr31.jpg)

It may look shabby, be the pizza I made was really delicious. I'll just leave the recipe for the dough [here](https://pizzaovenradar.com/p/basic-pizza-dough-pizza-recipe/), it's easy to make and goes well with almost any topping, I think. Though I prefer mozzarella, tomatoes, onions and sausages.

https://i.redd.it/hc30b08nzwr31.jpg

As I said I didn't have any experience with ovens, though as you already see the desire to eat delicious and sometimes not healthy food overrides this disadvantage.","Another Pompeii Pizza OvenHowdy, everyone.

The number of sawn bricks in a wedge and the manufacture of complex adjacent elements of the chimney immersed me in despair. As a result, I came to the conclusion that I need to hire specialists.

The stovemen wanted a lot of money. I refused. All right, let's think about buying a finished oven. Prices for the smallest (60 cm diameter) started at $1000...

But the desire to eat tasty food was buried under the indestructible arguments. I became obsessed with the idea. I admit it took some time.....

Eventually, while I was reviewing the posts by various MacGuyvers on the internet and r/DIY, I came across a guy who offered me a Pompeii stove kit for a reasonable price. Eventually, the vault, the bottom and the chimney were the separate elements. The money they wanted was about 500$. But some delivery shenanigans stopped me.

In short, I refused this option and eventually found a guy nearby, making a similar stove builder of refractory concrete. The price with the delivery did not exceed the same price, the dude lived not so far, so I decided. I'll take it.

I called and ordered it. I was informed that the oven would be paid on my order. That is, they are not ready to store it in the warehouse, and I will have to wait a week - two. Well, ok, I thought. I'll make a booth for that. We bought concrete blocks 40x20x20x20 (actually, something about 18x19x19x38. There are also fittings, claydite, mesh and 2 types of mixtures (stove and cement sand). I worked on weekends, sometimes in the middle of the week in the evening.

Whew. I think now I can share how it turned out.

[The result](https://i.redd.it/m9c5xai5zwr31.jpg)

It may look shabby, be the pizza I made was really delicious. I'll just leave the recipe for the dough [here](https://pizzaovenradar.com/p/basic-pizza-dough-pizza-recipe/), it's easy to make and goes well with almost any topping, I think. Though I prefer mozzarella, tomatoes, onions and sausages.

As I said I didn't have any experience with ovens, though as you already see the desire to eat delicious and sometimes not healthy food overrides this disadvantage."
Question on how long a screw needs to be when using spacers to attach mounting bracket to TV,DIY,5,dg6l2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/dg6l2f/question_on_how_long_a_screw_needs_to_be_when/,12,1570779633.0,"I apologize for this fairly narrow question, but I'm in the process of trying to attach my 55"" TCL C803 to a [perlesmith stand](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07T72QG3K/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and in order to make it so the bracket is not touching the casing, I have to use spacers. I have two questions:

1. Is there anything problematic with stacking the spacers? I think for the bottom holes, I'll need 15mm of separation but I only got 5mm and 10mm spacers in the kit I bought so my plan was to just use one of each on top of each other. Will that cause any problems?

2. The [VESA specifications for my tv](https://www.tclusa.com/sites/default/files/2017-12/55C803.pdf) say the screw size is M6 x 25 (Note: I am making the possibly incorrect assumption that 25 refers to the length of the screw indicating 25mm). Although the TV comes with these screws already inserted, my plan was use the M6 x 30 screws that came in my kit. My question here is will I have problems if the length of screw being inserted in the TV is less than 25mm since I am using spacers? The top two screws will stick in 20mm (I'm using a single 10mm spacer up there) and the bottom two will stick in 15mm (since I am using a 5mm and a 10mm spacer).

If anyone could give me some feedback, I'd really appreciate it. I'm all but ready to pop the tv on the stand but now I'm having paranoia of it immediately snapping off and was hopeful someone could either provide or point me to some instruction on this.","Question on how long a screw needs to be when using spacers to attach mounting bracket to TVI apologize for this fairly narrow question, but I'm in the process of trying to attach my 55"" TCL C803 to a [perlesmith stand](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07T72QG3K/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and in order to make it so the bracket is not touching the casing, I have to use spacers.

Help wiring a smart 3-way switch with a dumb 3-way dimmer,DIY,1,dg7usw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/dg7usw/help_wiring_a_smart_3way_switch_with_a_dumb_3way/,5,1570785747.0,"I have 6 LED recessed lights that I'd like to control with my a TP-Link HS210 smart switch but also have on a dimmer.

Edit: I just spent an hour looking up prices on lumber and other things from a materials list from a free plan i found online that was 24 x 16. It seems like the materials will be around $800, I know i can get it a couple hundred cheaper than that, but I know ill have to buy another tool or two plus some a couple windows(I can get them really cheap from locals).

From what I've read, sistering it would be ideal, putting new studs on both sides and tying them together through the old stud. In that case, should I just leave the old stud there? There are also the crossboards that are all in pretty good shape. Should I remove them before sistering the stud? Is there any danger in that?

We live in upstate NY, and the town that this is in didn't have any specifications to building a deck, just to follow standard code.

Monday: dug 9 holes to code and poured our 6"" cement base

Tuesday: placed our 9 6x6 and re-supported until dry 

Wednesday: placed our 3 double beams and built all the joists, started to place the deck boards, only got about 10 done out of 50ish

Friday: Deck boards, and placed 4x4 post for railings (with carriage bolts)

Saturday: finished railing and all touch ups

Beginning of the next week he got a letter in the mail from the town code enforcer stating that they noticed ""a structure that looks to be a deck"" on the back of the house. etc etc etc, now they wanted him to go through the permit process.

All is well, we send everything in, and he gets a reply letter. It states 3 problems, well sorta problems.....

1. ""please provide a letter showing what the measurements for the post holes depth and what was in place on the bottom of the posts"" it goes on to show different examples of how it can be done.

okay, shame on me for not putting it on the blueprints, so this is an easy fix/explanation.

2. ""the middle center post of the deck needs to provide a bracket to support the post to the beam"" it goes on to say u can either place the double beam on top of the post and use a bracket or to notch out the 6x6 and place them on top and attach using bolts.

Carriage bolts are not permitted.""** 

The actual problem doesn't list the problem being the bolts, only to verify how the center post is attached to the beam. I have never heard that carriage bolts can't be used , and is this something that might need to be changed?

Building a Planter Box on My Balcony Rail,DIY,4,dfmwhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/dfmwhs/building_a_planter_box_on_my_balcony_rail/,3,1570681831.0,"Hi there -- A few days ago my neighbor cut down a great old tree in between our yards. I was kind of bummed out at first, but today I was sitting on my porch and stunned at how much light it was getting. With the extra light, it now seems like a great place to grow a few herbs.

Here's [the spot](https://imgur.com/a/rcsvFoK).

I've watched a few planter how-to videos and read a couple tutorials, but I have two questions that I haven't seen answered:

1. How should I fix the planter to the rail? I can't build it on top, and as you can see from the photos (particularly photo two) the top of the rail isn't flat, which means I can't use a piece of metal or something like that. 
2. I don't have table saw, which almost every tutorial takes for granted. I can borrow other tools from friends but I don't really have access to the table saw. 

If anyone has answers, or suggestions, or links to resources that might help me make this thing, that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading.","Building a Planter Box on My Balcony RailHi there -- A few days ago my neighbor cut down a great old tree in between our yards.

what do you do when the electrical work is difficult to access? cannot get to junction box,DIY,4,dfjoo2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/dfjoo2/what_do_you_do_when_the_electrical_work_is/,12,1570668137.0,"Wanted to install a Panasonic whisper bathroom vent fan in my master bath last weekend - seemed like an easy enough weekend project that might take an hour or two after watching some videos and doing some reading. Our house is mostly one story, we have one tiny room upstairs, but the rest is just attic - which normally makes things easier in so far as accessing electrical is concerned. However, we ran into a serious road block - it appears our HVAC system is on top of the junction box for the electrical work in our bathroom. Ugh. I'm going to keep digging around the insulation that was blown on top of our ceiling but judging by where it SHOULD be (from measuring stuff) it appears it's underneath the HVAC, which is sitting on top of floor boards.

What now? Do I need to install a new circuit just to make this work? But even then, I'm having trouble imagining how I can install a switch (our original plan was to wire the fan up with the shower light, so that it would turn on when you turn on the shower light), because the bathroom current switches are directly under the HVAC as well.  I think creating a new circuit might be beyond our DIY skills but I'm not sure, it also seems like overkill. Secondly - IIRC from doing some stuff in our guest bath (which is immediately adjacent to the master) shares a circuit with the master. I don't know if that might mean there is somewhere else that we can access electrical in the attic or not. As I said I will keep digging around in the insulation hoping to find something but so far I""m not having luck. HELP! Our tiny bathroom desperately needs a ventilation fan system, it's too hot (and humid) where we live to open the window most of the year, and I'm constantly battling mold trying to grow in the shower and on the window (yuck).

Forgive me if I'm not using proper terminology (correct me if that's the case) - my husband is the one who mostly does the electrical stuff, I'm usually just helping by holding something in place or whatever. My DIY skills aren't really the electrical kind.

I imagine this is a more common problem for people living in two story homes when you need to access the electrical for light fixtures on the first floor - so I'm hoping there will be enough people here that can guide me.","what do you do when the electrical work is difficult to access? cannot get to junction boxWanted to install a Panasonic whisper bathroom vent fan in my master bath last weekend - seemed like an easy enough weekend project that might take an hour or two after watching some videos and doing some reading.

I would like to take care of it now and not hold up the install. There are two things that I can think of to remedy this. One, skim coat it with a leveler.

Freezing washer drain pipe,DIY,1,dfol0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/dfol0z/freezing_washer_drain_pipe/,12,1570688979.0,"Background: My sister-in-law called me a couple weeks ago and told me that every winter her washer drain pipe freezes, making her unable to do laundry. She asked for my help and I thought I'd just put some heat tape around it and problem solved.

So I went over to her house and she showed me the pipe in question. It runs out of a broken piece of the foundation and is totally exposed to outside weather. My heat tape idea was immediately out for a few reasons, most notably lack of an outlet and the location of the pipe, complete with being half buried in the ground. I tried searching for different solutions but could not find anything suitable or even a similar situation. She said she asked a plumber who was out recently and he said he didn't really have any ideas outside of packing straw on top of it. That didn't seem like a very good solution to me, but using my own knowledge and research has led me nowhere. Any other ideas on how to deal with this or is the straw the best solution here?

Edit with more info: After getting some responses here, I called my sister-in-law and dug for a little more info. She doesn't know anything about plumbing, but connecting the dots, it seems this is the main drain for the whole house. The reason she noticed it most with the washer is the washer is the final connection before the line leaves the house. She told me that when is gets really cold, none of the sinks or bathtub will drain. With that said, rerouting the pipe likely isn't an option. The house was built in the 1890s and plumbing was (very poorly) shoehorned into this house. She said that when she had plumbing work done a few years ago, they had to rip out the floor in one of her rooms to get to the pipes, but the floor was fixed afterward - so even seeing the indoor plumbing at this point is unlikely. This likely leaves my options at doing what is possible to the visible portion of the pipe in the picture.","Freezing washer drain pipeBackground: My sister-in-law called me a couple weeks ago and told me that every winter her washer drain pipe freezes, making her unable to do laundry.

I couldn't find any reasonably priced plastic or metal options. I am planning to buy 2x10 8ft and make 8 count of 7 3/8 inch wheels and stick them together between the wheels. I can't find a 7 3/8 inch hole-saw, so I need to cut them out using a jigsaw, which is going to be both time-consuming and mostly nonuniform wheels.

(Sorry for the weird description, I couldn't find the name of the material applied to the walls.)

We want to tile and paint the walls in our bathroom. Currently it has all textured walls, with something that resembles pebbles/gravel.

Should we fully strip the walls? Any tricks that anyone can provide? As I don't know the name of the material, research has not given a lot of results.

Add wood to steel garage door?,DIY,2,df7kqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/df7kqr/add_wood_to_steel_garage_door/,11,1570602857.0,"I have a pretty old, maybe 70's era white steel garage door. It's fairly thick steel, not like the new, cheap garage doors sold at big box stores today.  It has quite a bit of corrugation to the panels that runs parallel to the ground, making it even stronger. 

Rather than get rid of the very strong, but ugly white, plain, garage door, I've considered adding strips of Ipe wood to it running parallel to the ground. 

Has anyone ever seen this done? Will my 1/2 HP garage door opener be able to lift it if I have the spring adjusted for the additional weight?

Replacing gas fireplace with electric,DIY,0,dfa4jj,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/dfa4jj/replacing_gas_fireplace_with_electric/,4,1570614341.0,"Hello all, any insight would be appreciated. 

We have an older, 20+ year, gas fireplace that came with the house we bought three years ago. We are tired of the dated insert and can’t stand the smell when it is on. We are looking at replacing it and wanted input on a few things. 

First, let me just say I am the least handy man I know...

Second, how difficult would it be to remove all pieces of the hearth? There's a marble front and siding as well as a Millwood? Mantle. 

Third, how difficult to remove old gas insert and seal/cap gas line?

Fourth, how difficult to frame out from there to put in a mountable electric fireplace flush with new framed wall area?

Ideally we’d build the frame to the ceiling (8feet) and place a stone veneer around it complete with a floating mantle. 

I’m not sure I’m using the right terminology or if I’m being clear in what I’m looking to do but am asking for any helpful insight. 

Is any of this doable by myself? Approximate costs for hiring someone to do it?

Again, thank you for your time.","Replacing gas fireplace with electricHello all, any insight would be appreciated.

The Ikea solution would be about the same price as doing it myself and would be lighter leaving more weight for the monitors, PC, etc to be mounted to the desk. But the only problem that I see is that many of the lighter counters are using compressed unbleached paper for structural integrity. And I have seen some people have problems with the desk breaking when they attach a monitor stand to the countertop. Which I think I could stop with 12"" diamond plate under the counter.

Thanks in advance for any help from the DIY community!!  (obligatory “long time lurker, first time poster...”)

Earlier this summer, I purchased a “build it yourself” picnic table kit from Lowe’s, for putting on our deck.  If you’ve ever shopped at Lowe’s, you always see them sitting outside of the store.  I had been thinking about getting one for the family, so I finally bought one when they were on sale in July.  (If climate and context matter as we get into this question, I’m in the US Southeast.)  

I brought it home, put the raw lumber together with the included hardware relatively easily, and let it sit on our deck for about a week.  It seems important to note that the four leg pieces are pressure treated lumber, but the rest of it is not.  I purchased a gallon of Valspar “one-coat” exterior stain and sealer, the semi-transparent variety that promises “6 years of protection from weather.”  (I bought the cedar color, which is fine, but it looks kind of orangeish in the photos I took.)  I sanded the wood and then applied the stain in a single coat, after the table had been assembled and sitting outside for maybe 9 or 10 days total.   Very little rain during this time period, I would add.

The problem:  after just a few weeks, the table started to look “blackened.”  If you take a look at the photos, you’ll see what I’m talking about, with the weird bubbly black and gray shapes in the close-up, and the black streaking in some other areas of the wood.  (The really light colored marks and spots are just sidewalk chalk from my three-year-old from yesterday.)

Can anyone tell me what’s going on here?  And what I did wrong and/or what I need to do to fix this?  Is it mold?  The wood reacting badly to the stain?  I’m perplexed at what is causing this, and after a couple months, it only keeps getting worse.

 I'm quite new to this and google was a bit confusing to the point in how to assess the wall but had loads on how to prep and actually carry out the work.  Not that I would do anything but the filler as I understand plastering can be a bit tricky for the uninitiated."

I own a split level home and am installing a new deck to the back of my home (old deck had a 2x6 ledger board and a myriad of problems). I am upgrading the ledger board to a 2x12 to match the larger joists (increasing the span to 16' with 16'' off center joists). 

The problem I am running into is that the joist hangers (which I have verified are designed for 2x10s-2x12s) are not tall enough for me to toenail the joists into the house's rim board. [Here is a rough representation of what I am talking about.](https://i.imgur.com/GoSunMp.png) . 

I am wondering if I am fine to toenail my joists into the ledger board higher than the joist hangers, so I can get engagement with the house rim.

Help! I need your advice on how to improve the brick foundation of my house. Pictured is the interior.

**First off, what’s going on?** 

During rainstorms, water seeps through the brick itself. Water also leaks through that 100 year old casement window. I have a floor drain so I don’t have real flooding issues but I see all this scaling and want to fix it. Visually there is no missing mortar, and when I inspect with my hands there isn’t any loose mortar or bricks.

**My current plan to fix**

I want to clean the brick and seal it with Drylock. I don’t have the money for new windows right now, so I am planning to cover the window with a sheet of Lexan and just seal it up with Flexseal or some other adhesive, to keep out the elements.

**My specific questions…**

\- How can I clean the brick? I thought of taping up some painting tarp plastic on my joists and HVAC equipment and using a pressure washer, honestly. Or I could scrub with a brush and a bleach solution. Or should I use just water? Some other kind of soap?

\- Do I need my brick re-pointed? Per my point above, visually it looks fine and just touching it with my hands there isn’t loose mortar or bricks.

\- Is Drylock the right solution here? When it rains, you can see the droplets of water form on the inside of the wall; I don’t have the money for digging drains and trenches and whatnot, can I just paint it with the Drylock to keep my basement drier during a storm? I don’t intend to finish the basement at this point, I just want it to be drier down there.

**Other info:** 1929 construction, wood frame on brick foundation with two steel I-beams, half the footprint is a true basement and half is just foundation, located in Richmond VA.

**TLDR:** What’s the right way to clean this brick in my basement, and then how do I keep water out?","Advice on Cleaning & Sealing Brick Basement

So I'm thinking a combination of some cleaning chemicals with elbow grease and fine grit sanding.

  


Also any suggestions of paint brand? I'm UK based.

Apparently the common problem with this fridge is that the black bit (compressor) rattles against the metal bit behind it. I jammed some 4x thick cardboard behind it and the noises stopped INSTANTLY. What a relief! LG wanted $375 to replace the thing that probably wouldn't fix it.

Anyway, cardboard is flammable and compressors get hot. So I'm a little worried about fire. On the one hand, the rubber on the compressor that's been there all along temped at 140 degrees Fahrenheit and the cardboard has lots of airflow and it's around 90f. Cardboard doesn't spontaneously ignite until 421f.

A: do I leave the cardboard in there? It probably won't ever ignite, right?

B: if not A, what should I replace it with? I'm willing to spend some money on something as long as it makes sense!","I figured out what was wrong with my noise fridge and used a piece of cardboard to stop the noise.

The rotted area looks to be 2-4 inches high and 12-18 inches wide.","How to repair rotted exterior wall area?https://imgur.com/a/3veCQ0P

Should I spray some CLR in there and give it a good twist or am I on the wrong track?

I’m looking for advice about how start using my fireplace. 

Here’s a photo: https://imgur.com/a/y53u1IF

Briefly, I moved into my house 5 years ago and have never used it. The person who owned the house before used it a great deal as they didn’t have central heating (long story...). 

With winter coming, I thought it would be good to start using it if I can and would love your advice about how to do that. 

As you can see, there’s a fire basket, but in the refurb, there’s now carpet under the whole area. 

The chimney is just the brick chimney breast and it must be open as not only has it been used before, but there’s always a terrible draught coming down there!

Is it as simple as having a hearthstone over the carpet and giving it a go (with a carbon monoxide alarm handy?!) or is there way more to it?

Obviously, the longer it works without having to open the bottle and the more evenly the light is spread, the better. So simply using an LED  won't bring me the results wanted. I thought of making the liquid opaque and putting in a small keychain gadget with the actual glowing radioactive element Tritium in it, which emits light up to 35 years. Unfortunately, they're a bit expensive to just give it a shot, so does anybode have this keychain and can provide some information on the intensitiy of the light (will it shine through opaque blue liquid)?

I have a 60 gal air compressor.

I just recently replaced the pump as it was not working anymore. I am running into a problem where the motor slowly quits as the pressure in the tank approaches 15 PSI.

Just took the motor in for a service and it passed with flying colors.

When the tank valve is open, the motor runs the pump just fine and can pump air for 30+ minutes. The moment the valve is closed, the motor starts to labor and slowly quits.

I have ruled out the motor as an issue, the electrical is not an issue as it has been running fine for years before this.

Any thoughts?! It's too expensive to have a tech come out as they charge per hour to even drive here so I'm looking at $250.- just to have them take a look. Thanks","Air Compressor issues...Hey everyone.

should I wire a 150 Amp fuse between the starter battery and the isolator, and another 150 Amp fuse between the isolator and the aux battery?

do I need an additional 4 Amp fuse for the fan, or is the 4 Amp fuse already in the fan sufficient?

is it generally okay to use the same bolt for multiple chassis grounds (I can't think of why it would be bad but it seems like all the ground wires already in the van are going to unique chassis grounds, even if they are under 5 cm apart)

I was thinking of using a handheld tile wetsaw for the whole job on a work bench with the rail guide. I would like to know if this is a bad idea. The reason is i feel as though I find some use for the tool again in the future.

The other option is the table wetsaw which is a bit more expensive and i probably won't use it for a while.

I dont want to hire because the job will take me a while being a amateur and we are living in the house so things have to be shuffled around.

The 2 tools im currently looking at are (ryobi because of their 6 yr warranty and low cost):

Ryobi One+ 18V 4"" Wet / Dry Tile Saw

handheld type 

Ryobi 500W 178mm Wet Tile Cutter With Folding Stand

Table saw: type with the blade coming out of the table


Thanks in advance champs","Table or handheld wetsaw? Tile cut adviceHi all

Is there a rigid piece of plastic that I can buy two of to clamp a brush between for storage??,DIY,1,delpqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/delpqx/is_there_a_rigid_piece_of_plastic_that_i_can_buy/,8,1570494030.0,"Sorry if this isn't the right place to ask. I have a workbench, and I'd like to put a little thing on the underside of it that can hold the brush that I use to clean the surface after I get aluminum shavings all over it. My idea is kind of hard to describe, but I feel like I've seen it done somewhere before.

Basically, it would be two pieces of plastic fairly close together so that I can squeeze the brush handle between them, and they are close enough that the pressure from the two pieces holds the brush in place. I made a [shitty drawing](https://i.imgur.com/socjpzB.png) if my description is too terrible, but the drawing itself is pretty terrible, too.

I moved in a house recently. The house already has a 2GIG device, with an existing alarm code set up by the previous owner, which I don't know what it is. I don't know how to set up my onw alarm code either. The goal is to use this device to self monitor for home security. For DIY guru here, how to DIY remove the existing alarm code and then set up my own alarm code for 2GIG system, if that is possible to DIY?

I also called a local dealer A. Dealer A quoted me a very high price to set up the device (service fee), such that I can self monitor. Then I called dealer B, who quoted a very low fee to set up the device, but required me to sign a three year contract with a monthly fee with them. I called dealer C, who quoted a reasonable fee to set up the device, but asked me to pay them monthly without a contract, which means after one month I can terminate with them any time. Both Dealer B and C told me that 2GIG device can't be used for self monitor, and a homeowner has to pay a dealer to monitor their home.

So now I am confused and seek help here: Can 2GIG device be used for self monitoring? If it can be used for self monitoring, can I set up myself, to remove the existing alarm code set up by the previous owner, and then set up my own alarm code? Thank you very much.","How to DIY set up 2GIG device for self monitoring? Can 2GIG device be used for self monitoring? Different dealers are telling me different stories&#x200B;

\- purchased ""fix-a-floor"" and stabilized most hollow-sounding spots on the floor. This has actually worked far better than I thought it would, and I highly recommend the product! 

\- Scraped out old cracked grout.

\- Used pre-mixed color-matched grout to fill in all gaps and holes.

Stuck on how to install a replacement window in this opening.,DIY,4,de6ptp,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/de6ptp/stuck_on_how_to_install_a_replacement_window_in/,2,1570413438.0," I've been slowly working the way through house replacing windows. Most of them are traditional wooden windows with a sash cord, and so are pretty straightforward to drop in vinyl replacement windows.

However, the last few have been replaced once before using an older system and I am not sure what to do. Pictures of the system here: [https://imgur.com/a/W4dSv96](https://imgur.com/a/W4dSv96)

From what have found out Googling, this is some kind of older-style replacement window. The channels that the windows are running in are aluminum. I would assume that I can just tear the metal bits out. However, since the replacement windows rest against the outer stop and the stop would be gone...not sure what to do. And I can't find any non-destructive way to get it out, so once I tear it apart, I'm committed.

I thought maybe the best approach would be to tear the whole thing out and use a new-construction window -- it's on the first floor and I have good external access to the window -- but I'd really rather not remove the outside trim and possibly siding if I don't have to.

DIY | How to Install the Incra TS-LS Positioner on the Ridgid R4512 Table Saw,DIY,2,de880h,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/de880h/diy_how_to_install_the_incra_tsls_positioner_on/,2,1570419715.0," 

https://i.redd.it/cldbebug3zq31.jpg

Hey Guys! I just recently installed an Incra LS Positioner on my Ridgid R4512 Table Saw and I want to share the installation process with you. Inca was having a sale and I jumped at the chance. This table saw fence is incredible! By far the most accurate and versatile fence I have ever seen. So let dive into the installation process.

***\*Please use this post as just a guide. Refer to the instruction manual for full details.***

One of the downfalls from ordering this fence from Incra is the shipping lead times which can be up to 9 WEEKS! I talk to one of the Incra reps and he said with the tariffs and high demand of the fence, the production lead times were stretched to the max. I guess that is a good problem to have. So, when you order, be patient. It's worth the wait. The shipment includes 2 boxes (at least mine did). One box for the rails and the other box contains the fence parts and hardware. Be warned, the boxes are quite heavy with the stacked aluminum inside. The instruction manual was one of the most well-written manuals I have ever seen. Each bag of screws and hardware where labeled and included in the steps in the manual. So you can easily reference the corresponding part numbers.

1. Removing the old fence from the R4512 is super easy. This fence is absolute garbage and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemies. Remove all the bolts from the spacer rail, the rail bolts under the front of the table, at the back of the table, and the bolts holding the extension wings. (the bain of my existence) Good riddance!

&#x200B;

[Remove the rails and extension wings](https://i.redd.it/gltq4b6j3zq31.jpg)

&#x200B;

2. This would be a good time to give the table saw a good cleaning. Use an air compressor or a can of air dust to blow off any sawdust. Wipe down the sides and table with some WD40. Also, this would be a good time to remove any rust from the top and recoat it with some GlideCoat

3.  Take the rail mounts and attach them to the pre-existing bolt holes. You only need to use 2 mounts per side. Each mount attaches to the 2 end bolt holes of the cast iron top. The middle mount is not needed on the R4512. Only use the 3 mounts if your saw cast iron top is wider. (Grizzly, PowerMatic, Sawstop saws, ETC are usually wider) Space the mounts a 1/4"" from the top. Once there are spaced properly. Tighten the bolts so it doesn't shift when installing the rails.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/k31bvv5r3zq31.jpg

Pro Tip: There is absolutely no need to drill and tap any new holes in the cast iron top as others have suggested. Incra provides several different size bolts. The only real issue I had was the back rail mounts. But it wasn't really an issue when I figured out to just use the bolts that attached the old back rail. It worked beautifully.

4. Attach the t-nuts to the front and back mounting brackets. Then slide the rails into place. Space the rail dead center of the table. We will adjust this later.

[Attach the t-nuts that accepts the rails](https://i.redd.it/gjjup4xs3zq31.jpg)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

5. Tighten the t-nut bolts to secure the rail into place. Loosen the bolts on the mounting brackets. Use the positioner arm mounting brackets and clamp them to the bottom of the rails. Move the rail assembly up or down until the backside of the brackets are flush with the top of the cast iron top. This is going to ensure the rails are at the proper height. Then tighten the bolts to secure the rail mounting brackets.

[Clamp the Mounts to the bottom rail and flush the top](https://i.redd.it/bseg5zcx3zq31.jpg)

&#x200B;

6. Now it's time to assembly the positioner arm. Assemble the stop knobs and insert them into the right side of the rails. There are 4 stop knobs. 2 on the front and 2 on the back.

[Stop knob assembly](https://i.redd.it/qr8puqp14zq31.jpg)

7. Attach the glide pad to the bottom of the positioner bracket. Install the screw and nuts to each bracket then slide it into play on the positioner cross member. Leave the screws loose as we will need to adjust its position in a later step.

[Remove the philm and attached the glide pads](https://i.redd.it/sste4ix34zq31.jpg)

8. Flip the cross member over and install the Positioner into place. You will need to space the positioner 11"" from the edge. I used a large square and a ruler to get the exact spacing. Tighten the outside screws to lock it down

[Slide the positioner into place on the cross member and use a ruler\\square to position it](https://i.redd.it/zg12som54zq31.jpg)

9. Remove one of the brackets and slide it on top of the stop knob. Mount the cross member and positioner on to the rails. Then slide the opposite bracket and cross member on the backstop knobs. Then slide the cross member into the front mounting bracket.

[Attach the cross member into the bracket mounts](https://i.redd.it/5lwbenh74zq31.jpg)

10. Slide the cross member back so that it's spaced 37 1/4"" away from the blade. I used the miter slot and measured 32"" because I know my miter slot is 5 1/4"" away from the blade. This makes it easier to use a tape measure. Once the spacing is correct. Tighten the screws on the mounting brackets to lock it into place.

[Position the cross member 37 1\/4\\"" from the blade](https://i.redd.it/hf1whs794zq31.jpg)

11. Attach the front mounting bracket to the positioner arm. Then slide the arm into the positioner. Note: there is a small lip on the side of the arm that slides into the receive lip on the positioner. Once you have those lips engaged the arm slides freely. This can be a bit tricky.

[Installed fence mounting bracket](https://i.redd.it/3k3hpujd4zq31.jpg)

[Slide the arm into place](https://i.redd.it/uwhkzhff4zq31.jpg)

12. Slide the fence into the mounting brack of the arm. Leave the screws loose so we can calibrate it in a later step.

[Slide the fence into place using the bottom t-track](https://i.redd.it/0byh6rth4zq31.jpg)

&#x200B;

13. Install the Fence hold down brackets into the front and back of the fence.

[Install the front and back hold down brackets. This prevents the fence from lifting up during cutting operations. Don't tighten any bolts](https://i.redd.it/iptk1lkl4zq31.jpg)

14. Time to make the new extension wings (My favorite part). I made the wings out of phenolic laminated plywood so they will not have any seasonal movement. You can use whatever you would like. Melamine or MDF would be a good choice as well. Each wing is supported by a pair of cleats. Rip 2 cleats for each size and then cut them to width according to your spacings. The spacings are going to be different according to the size of the Positioner you purchased. Drill holes into each cleat according to the provided instructions in the Incra manual. Attach the clients using washer, bolt, and nut to the rails. Make sure the head of the bolts you use is large enough to fit into the t-track on the rail. Measure the width and length of the openings and rip the plywood accordingly. Place the plywood on top of the cleats and fastening into place with l-brackets to the cleats on the underside.

&#x200B;

[The plans for these wings can be found in the instruction manual](https://i.redd.it/uav7qfjn4zq31.jpg)

15. Final Calibration.

* Place a piece of 3/4"" plywood scrap into the miter slot and butt the fence up next to it. Adjust the arm and position so that it's square. Tighten down the screws on the positioner to lock it into place.
* place popsicle sticks (2 stacked on top of each other) under the fence. Space each pair equally down the length of the fence.
* with the fence mounting bracket screws loose, raise the arm until it's parallel to the rails. Tighten the bolts on the mounting bracket. Test to see if the arm slides easily. If it does not slide easily, it's not parallel to the rails. Keep adjusting the height until it slides easily. This is a crucial step in the process or the fence will not work properly.
* Slide the fence to 1/32"" away from the blade. Set the fence into micro-adjustment mode by raising the red lever on the positioner to the middle position. Rotate the red dial away from you until the fence kisses the blade. Lock the fence into place
* Detach the magnetic ruler and slide it down the arm until the zero marking is lined up with the line indicator in the positioner window. Hold down one end of the ruler and attach the rest of the ruler into place. Make a couple of test cuts and adjust accordingly.

Simple open joint cladding ideas,DIY,3,de80ia,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/de80ia/simple_open_joint_cladding_ideas/,0,1570418799.0,"Hi all - I've built a small lean-to style shed next to my house. The framing is 16"" OC, about 6.5 ft in the front and 7ft in the back (only 27"" depth due to space limitation).  
The back wall (towards house) is already sided with LP SmartSide Panels but I'm thinking of being more creative on the other three sides - hence the question on open joint/gap siding. I think it would be cool to have a modern geometrical look next to my traditional looking lap siding. 

The main downsides are that some of the purpose-built wrap products - whether 3D grooves for drainage or to be used with furring strips - are insanely expensive and would be wasteful for such a small project. The reason I don't like furring strips is that it seems like the gap would be excessive (at least 1/2"" behind the siding) and I have to worry about wasps/hornets in my area.  

So my idea is to sheathe the entire structure with OSB and use 30# felt to cover it generously, perhaps double layers. But rather than putting furring strips, I was thinking about attaching each siding panel with a washer or spacer (like 1/8"") behind it and a nice looking SS steel fastener through the siding, washer, felt, and into the OSB (maybe the stud?). 

It's a small shed. I plan to use LP SmartSide Smooth (12"" wide) planks that are cut to right size (so 27"" by 12"" on side walls, longer on the front wall). I'm thinking maybe 1/4"" gap between, not sure what would look right until I see it. 

Two questions:  

1) How long do you think tar paper lasts in the gaps? Only one side gets sun. I'll definitely have two layers in each gap.  

2) Would the washers provide enough of a gap?  

Hoping someone who has done open joint siding before can chime in. Thank you.","Simple open joint cladding ideasHi all - I've built a small lean-to style shed next to my house. The framing is 16"" OC, about 6.5 ft in the front and 7ft in the back (only 27"" depth due to space limitation).

So my idea is to sheathe the entire structure with OSB and use 30# felt to cover it generously, perhaps double layers. But rather than putting furring strips, I was thinking about attaching each siding panel with a washer or spacer (like 1/8"") behind it and a nice looking SS steel fastener through the siding, washer, felt, and into the OSB (maybe the stud?). 

It's a small shed. I plan to use LP SmartSide Smooth (12"" wide) planks that are cut to right size (so 27"" by 12"" on side walls, longer on the front wall). I'm thinking maybe 1/4"" gap between, not sure what would look right until I see it. 

Two questions:  

1) How long do you think tar paper lasts in the gaps? Only one side gets sun. I'll definitely have two layers in each gap.  

2) Would the washers provide enough of a gap?  

Hoping someone who has done open joint siding before can chime in. Thank you."

We live in a 1901 house. We have one daughter and more planned. We had a blood test done with an elevated lead level. Long story short or bathroom ceiling has lead paint and it is chipping/peeling. There is no exhaust fan in the bathroom.

The bathroom is pretty small 10'x6' nearly rectangular. I'm almost sure the ceiling is plaster and lathe.

Here is my dilemma, I want to fix the ceiling and add a exhaust fan. I know there are several precautions that need to be taken (hepa vac, plastic off the room and HVAC, etc) but what would you do with the ceiling itself? Cut out the whole thing and re sheetrock? Scape the paint and repaint? Scrape and encapsulate?

Any advice is welcomed.","Lead Painted Bathroom Ceiling Removal advice requestedHey all,

1. Started with removing back, cleaning it out and spray painting outside black matte again.
2. Removed lighting gel as the orange sheet was cracked and brittle.
3. Then removed glue residue with scraper and rough grit sanded for better bonding.
4. Ordered new theatre gel- a steal on ebay for $6!
5. Cut to fit, sanded future glue points.
6. Used gorilla glue with a little sprayed water to hold better.
7. Waited 24 hours before installing lighting.
8. Done! Happy to have our old sign looking new.
9. Maybe Later - replace lighting with LED's

Re-furbing doors.,DIY,1,de5p8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/de5p8t/refurbing_doors/,9,1570409020.0,"I'm looking for any advice anyone has in regards to Re-furbing and stripping old wooden doors.

I'm renovating a vintage property and to try and keep costs down I decided to reuse the existing doors.

They were thick with gloss paint, so I stripped the majority of the paint off with a heatgun and scraper.
Now I am trying to sand them down the rest of the way back to the original timber, so I can oil them and leave them traditional looking. However I'm struggling to remove much, and the sandpaper tends to clog up within seconds of starting.
I have 12 doors to do and it's taking hours just to do a small section.
Is it just a case of baring with it, or is there any easier way/tips/tricks anyone can share with me?

Thanks for any information in advance.","Re-furbing doors.I'm looking for any advice anyone has in regards to Re-furbing and stripping old wooden doors.

I am useless with DIY but I try where I can, recently the extractor fan in our bathroom broke and I haven’t bothered to fix it as we just open the window when showering etc. 

Long story short we had a slight bit of damp/mould starting to form on the ceiling so I used mould cleaner to get to moved before anything properly formed. The ceiling was very soft and gave way creating a small hole. 

I thought this would be an easy fix and simply pollyfiller the hole, I was wrong. The hole is worse and the pollyfiller obviously didn’t work. Any advice/help is appreciated. I don’t post on reddit much and have forgot to how to put pictures in a post.. happy to share photos of my shoddy attempt to fix the problem if I can figure that out.

Even though the desk was complete, it was really bad condition.  The project started with a complete disassembly. I then moved to stripping off all of the paint, first with a chemical striper, then wire brushing, and ultimately sanding everything smooth.  All the metal work was repaired, then primed and painted with Rustoleum primer and spray paint.   The woodwork was repaired, sanded using a variety of methods from 80 to 220 grits and then finished with Verathane Summer Oak and seven coats of a water-based poly gloss clear coat sanded in between at 220 and polished and buffed.  Finally, the desk and chair were reassembled and delivered back to its owners.

My partner and I recently bought our first house. It was built in the 80s.

We have a gas range, but unfortunately there is no gas line to the kitchen. Currently we are on a tight budget and so we decided to purchase a used electric range for cheap in the meantime.

We brought the range home but noticed that we have a 3-prong outlet while the range has a 4-prong cable.

I decided to try replacing the cable but I noticed that there was absolutely no ground connection. After doing some light research and looking at the owners manual for the range, I've determined that the ground strap that was originally going from the neutral terminal to the body of the appliance was removed forcefully.

**Im having doubts because I don't want to make a fatal error. Could anyone tell me if this will work?**","Converting stove/range from 4- to 3-prongHey DIY,

My partner and I recently bought our first house. It was built in the 80s.

We have a gas range, but unfortunately there is no gas line to the kitchen. Currently we are on a tight budget and so we decided to purchase a used electric range for cheap in the meantime.

We brought the range home but noticed that we have a 3-prong outlet while the range has a 4-prong cable.

I decided to try replacing the cable but I noticed that there was absolutely no ground connection. After doing some light research and looking at the owners manual for the range, I've determined that the ground strap that was originally going from the neutral terminal to the body of the appliance was removed forcefully.

I brainstormed with my dad and we had the idea of cutting the end off of the ground wire and using that in place of the ground strap.

Shower Base and Drain Help,DIY,2,ddrr1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/ddrr1g/shower_base_and_drain_help/,6,1570331381.0,"Full disclosure here, I am a moderately ambitious DIYer, but I feel very much out of my league on this project! So, any help or guidance you can give me would be appreciated.

I'm working on replacing the floor tile on my 1960's shower that sits above my garage in our split level house. My goal was not only to replace the tile itself because it was very old and pretty nasty, but to examine the shower base beneath which I knew was compromised, because it had started slowly dripping into my garage below. I've pulled up the tile and it was very obvious where water was getting through (to the right of the drain in image #1 below) because the material in this area was soft and somewhat muddy / sandy whereas everywhere else it was firm and hard. In the pictures below I have dug out that area to get to the subfloor beneath (which is not very rotted, but definitely damp).

I was also able to determine (I'm pretty sure) how water was getting into my garage below. If you look at the third picture below, you can see my finger pointing to a gap around this flange or whatever on the drain pipe. I think this area was saturated with water, and that was the release point for any excess water that came through. This is consistent with what we were seeing below with water dripping down this pipe on the outside of it. You can see a little bit of daylight in picture #4, and this is where my finger is in picture #3 where I've dug out all the way to this part of the drain.

Here are some [images](https://imgur.com/a/qXoK5bU) to show what I'm talking about.

So, this leads me to a few questions:

1. How was water getting through in the first place? My guess is that it was slowly seeping through my tiles in this section of the shower. We had very small tiles, which means a ton of grout lines. It makes sense to me that, over time, those seals in between tiles were not keeping water out, and water was slowly getting below below, and here we are. The water saturated that section, and then the water found a release under that part of the drain shown in the pictures. Agree, or think something else was happening here? I understand it could also have been leaking around the mouth of the drain where the drain meets the tile. Either way, that would be a tiles not being sealed well issue, right?
2. Do I need to consider replacing my drain, or is it likely fine? One thing I've done, before ripping up all the tile, was to pour copious amounts of water straight down the drain, and I've had no issues with water leakage below. I really do believe water that gets INTO the drain is fine. I think it's just that I had water getting through the tile / base and coming down the side of this drain, but if I were to have new tile with new grout, and a new moisture barrier / membrane on top of this... is my drain likely good to keep as-is? Or is it one of those things where, since I've gotten this far, I should look into getting the drain out? I don't really want to do it ""just because I've come this far,"" but I also don't want to NOT do it, if it really needs to happen. If you think this thing is just so old and it's likely compromised in ways that I'm not realizing and it needs to go... let me know.
3. This leads to my another BIG question... where do I go from here as far as getting ready to put tile back on? I have done some research about using either a liquid membrane like RedGuard or one of the waterproof membrane ""rolls""... but is that something I could apply on top of this existing base (shown in image #1), or do I need to consider removing ALL of this old base and getting down to my subfloor. My thought has been that most of this material is in tact and solid, except where it was damaged on the right side, so perhaps I should build on top of this layer. In other words, get my subfloor dried out and patched up, then fill in the chunk that I've taken out (with what, some type of mortar mix?), and THEN use this as my base layer that I start rebuilding tile? And if so, what do you recommend doing next? Do I apply a waterproof layer on top of this, and then some sort of prefab shower tray (like Schluter Kerdi) on top of a thinset mortar, then put more thinset mortar and tile? The biggest issue with this layer currently is that it's not perfectly smooth since the tile pulled up some of this layer with it and it's a bit splotchy. Does it make more sense to NOT use a prefab tray, and to just refinish this layer with some type of overlay (keeping in mind the pitch, etc.), and then waterproof it and tile it? Or is that prefab tray a good way to go just because it has the right pitch, it's made of a good material, etc. I know that's a lot of questions, but hopefully my general question makes sense: how do I get from where I am now in these pictures to a place that is ready to tile?
4. Obviously, if I do use this base layer as my foundation on which I'm going to re-tile, and if I do build on this layer just a little bit with waterproof membrane, mortar, etc., then my new tile is going to be raised slightly higher than my old tile, which will make it hard to seal around my drain. Do I consider something like one of these ""extend o-drain"" [kits](https://www.amazon.com/Extendo-O-Drain-Extend-O-Drain-4-3-8/dp/B007BV6ED8/ref=asc_df_B007BV6ED8/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=198111101494&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=14607906552616376246&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9012564&hvtargid=pla-351737196878&psc=1) that raises my drain by 1/4 inch, or is that a poor solution? Do we just go back to point #2 and say, you need to replace your drain. If I do need to go this route of replacing the drain, any kits you would point me to that make this easy, or is this definitely a ""call a plumber"" step? I recognize that removing the current drain might be tricky, even though I do have access from below as you can see from picture 4.

Any other major tips or pointers you would give me? Any videos that are a must watch? I've done a good bit of research, but wanted to be able to ask about my specific situation since I am a bit out of my league, so thanks in advance for any input!

Bathroom Vent Fan Leaking Water Question,DIY,2,ddrqug,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/ddrqug/bathroom_vent_fan_leaking_water_question/,3,1570331362.0,"Hi,

I have a bathroom vent fan leaking water during certain conditions and I'd like to know how to fix it. 

The vent opens on a north facing roof. And it is on a slope. The water drips back in the vent fan on the second floor when there is snowfall and then warms up and melts. As winter progresses it will also happen after a shower and the steam is vented up the same fan. 
It is only during these conditions that there is water dripping back in.

I had someone come in and make sure the vents were connected to the vent caps through the attic and it appears the seals are ok. The insulation around the bathroom fan and the attic seems to be adequate too.

Visual inspection of the roof from thr ground appear to have snow built up around the vent cap. The snow doesn't melt properly due to location, angle of roof, some other cause??????? I don't know. What else could be causing this to happen under the environmental conditions described.  I should also say during summers with rainfall nothing out of order happens. 

My question is what is it? How can I get it fixed? What DIY stuff could I do?

  Looking to build a ~10' outdoor wall mounted, adjustable incline climbing wall for my 3 year old. A link to my first draft is below. Basically, attach 4 2x4s vertically to the outside wall. Build the climbing wall separately with 1x4 planks secured to 2x4 sub structures which use the wall mounted 2x4s as a track. Secure the wall at the top using 2 metal rods that insert from the middle (outer walls make it difficult to insert from the sides). I want something adjustable and something that easily tucks fairly flat against the wall. 

  Issues I see:
1) The wall is going to be heavy, and I want to make sure that it's securely attached to the outside wall (stucco with 1/2"" plywood underneath). 

2) Relocating it up and down is not something we'll be doing every day, more like every month. 

  Please feel free to critique, and if I move forward I'll be sure post the whole thing start to finish!

Secure the wall at the top using 2 metal rods that insert from the middle (outer walls make it difficult to insert from the sides). I want something adjustable and something that easily tucks fairly flat against the wall. 

  Issues I see:
1) The wall is going to be heavy, and I want to make sure that it's securely attached to the outside wall (stucco with 1/2"" plywood underneath). 

2) Relocating it up and down is not something we'll be doing every day, more like every month. 

  Please feel free to critique, and if I move forward I'll be sure post the whole thing start to finish!

Rather than cutting this bench back and adding in another panel we were thinking maybe we could make a square hole and add a pine or stone feature to the bench?

Anyone think this would look OK or have other ideas?

Also can join benchtops on a sink or is that a bad idea?

DIY Miniature tensile testing machine,DIY,39,dda9zz,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/dda9zz/diy_miniature_tensile_testing_machine/,9,1570237857.0,"Hi Everyone, 

I was suggested to share my machine here, so I do it. 

[Miniature tensile testing machine](https://i.redd.it/exr702hz3kq31.png)

During the last 1.5-2 years I was working on a miniature tensile testing machine in my free time. During my job, I work a lot with materials testing and I've always been interested in tinkering, so this project is a good combination of everything. Originally, I started to work on this project, because I was working with a machine which had a very poorly written software and I was not satisfied with it. Also, the mechanics of that device was a bit poorly designed. So, I though, I could improve this. The presented project is still under development, but the machine is already fully functional and works quite well. 

At this moment, there are two big challenges. Firstly, I have to solve the problem with the displacement measurement. For some reasons, the caliper picks up some noise and I could not find the source of it so far. Whenever I connect the power supply to the controller of the stepper motor, the numbers on the display of the caliper go crazy. I tried different stepper drivers, different power supplies, but nothing helped so far. I still haven't tried to power the caliper from a separate PSU, so I have to check it. But I suspect, that the noise comes from somewhere else. Maybe I should shift the logical level of the caliper as close as possible to the PCB of the caliper and carry the already shifted signal to the Arduino. As you see it now, the signal from the caliper is carried to the main box (with a shielded cable) and the level is shifted there. I also have a plan B. I recently bought a DRO scale. I have to figure out how to read the signal of it with Arduino (I just recently received it, so I haven't really checked anything) and maybe it will be a better solution. Also, it is more robust, so it should work better with this machine.

Secondly, I want to compress the device into a more compact format. There are already plans for this, but I am very busy and I am also a bit short on resources (for example, CNC and other stuff). I show a 3d-printed part in the video which I use to hold the shafts and bearings. That would be one idea to make it more compact. However, I started to design something with individual bearings and L-shaped profiles. But I still have to make some drawings, measurements, and some preliminary assembly to see how I can implement the new design. 

[Sketch of the L-profile-based power transmission \(gears and shafts\)](https://i.redd.it/gjfta2114kq31.jpg)

I made a video for you guys, because it is more easy to explain it by speaking than writing a novel. And it is also better to see the actual parts that I talk about.[Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSf6cwc6GtI&list=PLaeIi4Gbl1T9_tOk-mwGmbdWcfcrAMq4m&index=2&t=0s)

This is a closeup video of a sample and at the same time you can see the evolution of the tensile curve:

[Testing of a steel sample (closeup view)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNz2B1gsjtY&list=PLaeIi4Gbl1T9_tOk-mwGmbdWcfcrAMq4m&index=4&t=0s)

I also have a series of videos, where you can follow the project from the first iteration. [Playlist for the whole project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSf6cwc6GtI&list=PLaeIi4Gbl1T9_tOk-mwGmbdWcfcrAMq4m)

I was asked for the parts, so this is the list with an approximate price in USD. Not all, but all the main components are on the list.

\- Base plate (laser cut, custom design) - $35

\- NEMA23 15:1 stepper motor - $75

\- TB6600 stepper motor driver - $10

\- Digital caliper - $8

\- Circuits for caliper (DC-DC converter, level shifter) - $3, $2

\- GX16 connectors (3,4 and 5 poles) - $10

\- 5 kN load cell - $62

\- EK08 support bearing (for the shaft for the worm gears) - 2 x $13

\- Crosshead pieces (laser cut, custom design) - 6 x $7

\- 1M-20T worm gear set (gear and wheel) - 2 x $12

\- Twin lead screw with nuts - 2 x $ 42

\- Custom made grips (CNC, custom design) - 2 x $53

\- Pillow bearings - 2 x $2.65

\- BK10 support bearing (main bearings for the lead screws) - 2 x $12

\- Arduino and other circuits (Uno, Nano, HX711) - $3, $2, $1.2

\- Power supply - $15

\- Plastic box - $8

\-------------------------------------

Sum \~ $550

But, this is a very rough estimate since the price of the custom made parts can vary. I also haven't considered the cost of the tools and small parts that I already had at home or I actually had to buy. Small screws, spare parts, wires, soldering stuff, etc. Furthermore, the hours I spent on design, programming, assembling and disassembling this several times, etc. The reality is more close to $1000 if you want to buy everything from a proper seller and in high quality. I bought most of the stuff from China from random sellers from Alibaba (In fact, I am very satisfied with them and those products), and from other, mostly Chinese websites. The system is capable of measuring much larger forces (about 20 kN) easily, but based on the current load cell, I am limited to 500 kg. It is really difficult to find cheap and small load cells with higher capacity. 

I am still working on this machine and hopefully I will be able to turn it into a nice product at the end. The programming part is about 90% done (some improvement can be done, and I want some more, fancy features), so most of the work should be done on the mechanical part. I will do more tests with different materials in the future and I will also publish them as videos.","DIY Miniature tensile testing machineHi Everyone,

I installed the joists and used a stain and sealer on the parts I was keeping after sanding and power washing. By the time I was ready to lay decking my job as a teacher had started again as well as grad school.

i knew i would remove the drop ceilings throughout the home to get the lost space back.  what i didnt expect to find is that the home had all of the exterior walls framed out and batt insulation installed. the insulation only goes as high as the drop ceiling or a foot above with vapor barrier between the insulation and drywall. in areas where the ceiling is dropped with drywall, there are insulation batts above.  

everything ive read about masonry buildings says that insulating on the inside is a huge no-no because it causes freeze thaw cycles that damage the bricks.  the home was wrapped in aluminum siding, likely before the insulation retrofit.  so i cant inspect the bricks from the outside without significant cost.

the question is, do i take down the insulation to prevent further damage or leave it and hope that the home doesnt fall over?","Should i remove insulation from the inside of my masonry century home.I just purchased an 1888 Victorian style home in northern utah.  one of the things that attracted me to it, other than the price, was that it had 10 foot ceilings hidden behind dropped ceilings.  i knew this because in some places the ceiling was dropped with commercial style boards. some spots were dropped with drywall on top of some other type of board that resembles ceiling tiles.

Do you create the grade with the 4-6” gravel base and then use the sand to make a level base on top of that grade? Or does the whole patio need to have a slight decline to ensure all water runs away from house foundation? 

Also does using landscape fabric create any problems with water pooling or does it not really effect how water settles?

So I've been researching this topic and it seems to be a fairly common issue when applying dark color grout. I have not sealed after grouting yet (I did seal the porous tiles before grouting with 511 impregnateor).

I just did the grout yesterday and today it's pretty dark in some places and basically chalky white in a lot of the other ones. I'm not sure how it got to this (most likely too wet of a cleanup sponge?) but I'm trying to fix this!

Does anyone have suggestions on what to do? The tiles are white with a 1/8th inch dark grey grout line. I have not sealed yet. Is there a product to use to help clean this up or am I totally screwed?

Easy privacy shutters for bathroom window made from painted rulers and pvc pipe,DIY,10,ddajul,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/ddajul/easy_privacy_shutters_for_bathroom_window_made/,2,1570239061.0,"I’ve had this up for almost 2 years already. 
Wanted to share my [diy privacy shutters ](https://imgur.com/a/yROmokH) which is my solution to a window that is placed at chest level right in our shower area. The shutters allow us to keep the window open but also provide us privacy. We keep the shower window open at all times to promote airflow and prevent moisture and mold since the previous owners did not install an exhaust fan (probably because they chose a window instead?) the other bathroom doesn’t have a window but does have a fan. A curtain would be the immediate solution for privacy but it would constantly be wet. The perimeter is made out of  pvc pipes and elbows connected to fit the inside of the window. Make sure to take in your measurements to account for when the elbows slide into the pipe. That shortens your measurements. I didn’t account for that and only measured the Full length of each of the pieces and forgot that It still has to slide into the elbow and I will lose some inches. .....but in the end I got lucky and it still fit. It was good anyway because since it was smaller, I was able to wiggle it in diagonally when assembled and I also made it shorter than the actual opening so that It can stand upright as I slide the window close on top of it to hold it in place. I drilled holes along the sides of the pipe and these are where the ‘pins’ go. I took Home Depot rulers and cut them to size by assembling the frame first and then measuring from one end of the inner perimeter to the other end  and used that measurement to cut the rulers. This also makes sure there are no big gaps at the top of the rulers when installed. Then I coated them with white water resistant paint- similar to what they use on bathroom walls- I think spray paint would have been easier. I did 2 coats by hand and that was the longest part. One thing I would suggest is that the rulers that are on either end closest to the vertical pvc frames should be wider or fatter because the elbows prevent it from swinging fully closed so there is a larger gap. Maybe super glue two rulers together at the edges to make a wider one for those ends? I hammered some stainless steel nails to both of the  edges of the ruler leaving a big portion of it sticking out so it can be inserted into the holes you made in the pvc pipes. Since the ruler is so slim you want the thinnest nails so you don’t split the ruler when you nail it in. The rulers swing around if you want to open them or close them by hand exactly  like shutters. Just make sure when you are measuring where to put the holes in the pipe that the rulers lay slightly on top of the other as to prevent huge gaps where people can peek through when you put it in the closed position. To assemble the rulers I first put all the pins on the top side then I lined up the pins on the bottom and I closed the pipes together. This was tricky since there are a lot of holes and pins and lining up. I recommend a second person to help.

Important: People recommended that I install an actual exhaust fan since airing moisture out with a window is inefficient. So please don’t do this if ur only trying to exhaust a bathroom. If you like to shower with the window open but want some privacy and have extra airflow then this can be good for you. Note that I also live in Southern California where keeping the window open is not a huge issue all year round.","Easy privacy shutters for bathroom window made from painted rulers and pvc pipeI’ve had this up for almost 2 years already.

Which type of unvented gas heater is best for an unfinished basement?

Basement stays 55F-65F on coldest days with no heat. Occasionally I will need it to be more comfortable for using the shower down there. I know infrared is a more comfortable heat to feel, but I think it is best when it is spread out rather than concentrated in a single spot. My problem with it is that the gas hookup for it is around 30' from the bathroom. I'm thinking convection might be better for heat dispersal.  

I currently heat the house with a gas furnace, and there are 2 vents down there already.

Problem with a new radiant heat install,DIY,3,dd1uav,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/dd1uav/problem_with_a_new_radiant_heat_install/,3,1570188461.0,"Hello all,

Image of my setup: [https://imgur.com/gallery/dnzFRfI](https://imgur.com/gallery/dnzFRfI)

My kitchen flooded back in February and I decided to completely gut it as it could have been a set on That 70's Show. As part of the renovation I decided to put in radiant floor heat under my tile. I did a bunch of research on them back when I decided to do it (March) and have just now finished plumbing it in.

The rest of my house is heated with a gas fired boiler going to the baseboards. I plumbed the new radiant system into this with a mixing valve to bring the heat down to 120 ([https://www.pexuniverse.com/taco-5004-c3-g-mixing-valve-lead-free](https://www.pexuniverse.com/taco-5004-c3-g-mixing-valve-lead-free)).

I'm having two issues right now.

1. How can I make the circulator for the radiant fire only when the Radiant thermostat calls for heat? I put the baseboard thermostat on Zone 4 as this Taco 404 controller is supposed to only trigger the end switch when a zone except 4 is calling for heat, but that doesn't seem to be working. I don't want to make the radiant my priority zone because I plan to add more zones in the future as I'm working on the house.
2. The circulator doesn't seem to be pumping correctly, is the turn too close to the output of the pump? I know I was reading that there's supposed to be 12"" of pipe before the circulator, not sure about after. I'm not seeing any GPM on the flow gauges on the supply lines. Just FYI the shutoffs connecting to the boiler supply and returns were open during testing, I've since disconnected the circulator and shut them off so I can run the baseboard heat until I figure it out. Status lights on the circulator are on and I can hear it, so it should be pumping.

I can work around #1 right now by swapping the radiant to the priority zone and using that end switch so that's not as big of an issue right now, but I'd appreciate any comments that can help with that. My big problem right now seems to be with getting flow through the system. That's a variable speed Taco pump ([https://www.pexuniverse.com/taco-vr1816-viridian-variable-speed-circulator-pump](https://www.pexuniverse.com/taco-vr1816-viridian-variable-speed-circulator-pump)) as I planned on adding more zones in the future, so it should be able to handle it on max load but I'm seeing nothing.

Oddly enough, I get more heat on the supply side than through the mixing valve. I'm thinking I need to add a check valve on the return as I was seeing 120 at the return and 70 at the supply.

I appreciate any advice y'all can give me as to how to solve these issues or how I may have messed up the plumbing!","Problem with a new radiant heat installHello all,

They used 18 gauge cleats for the tongue and groove solid strand bamboo flooring. This was installed in my living room and kitchen on my main floor (basement below) onto plywood subfloor. 

The flooring was properly weathered and I made very sure they used the cleats specified by the manufacturer. 

In one spot, the planks have ""tented."" They have pushed into one another and can easily be pushed down with a foot. Now, I've checked and checked for any signs of moisture, swings in humidity, etc. and haven't found anything that leads me to believe this is an issue. I've also removed my baseboards and the floor has plenty of room to contract/expand. 

I'm kind of left clueless on what is causing this. My theory is that the installers didn't use enough cleats in the installation. I had a ""flooring expert"" come out to look and he also seemed to think the boards weren't properly nailed down.

So I'm wondering if my theory even makes sense or if it's something else and wanting to know what my options are. Could I potentially face nail the problem spot down? I wouldn't mind some damage to the face as ripping up the 600 sqft space and restarting would be a large expense.

&#x200B;

Today I installed a fixed length tennis ball stopper in the garage. Some yt videos suggest to make it a retractable stopper by connecting the cord with the upper end of the garage door (e.g. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0695k47QTdY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0695k47QTdY) ), which looks very neat.

Since our car has a windshield at a height closer to the ceiling than in most of those videos (tennis ball hangs at lowest point possible w.r.t the windshield) what happens when I hook the cord to the garage door is that the ball gets pushed all the way in to the ceiling before the door reaches the final position.

How can I implement a simple mechanical solution that helps alleviate this issue. I dont want to add any further arms or stiff extensions to the garage door, but rather simply work with the cord itself and maybe a more intelligent way to route the cord along the ceiling.","Retractable Tennis Ball Stopper - Cord LengthHi,

I was looking to get overhead storage for my garage, but all of the ""DIY"" kits state that they are not to be used with steel framed homes. I suppose this is because the hardware only uses lag bolts designed for wood. I decided I would take a chance at installing my own system. I used Plus-Nuts to hold channel struts into the ceiling, and then hung wire framed shelving with 1/2"" threaded rod.

My procedure was as follows: Obtain home blueprints. Discover house has 16"" on center metal joists for ceiling. Determine that spare 18"" X 48"" shelves will space across 3 joists for bolts

Actually measure joists: Use stud finder to locate joists, Note that that every 12 feet doubled studs are used. Also note that 16"" on center was most likely just a ""suggestion"" spacing varies from 13"" to 18"".

Actually measure shelves: Discover that shelves are 16.5"" and 46.5"" on center for mounting holes. Also, determine that garage door will only allow 16"" of drop down from ceiling.

Rework plans...

New plans call for 3 channel struts over the car parking area, parallel to how car is parked

Center strut will hold one side of all shelves, side channels will hold other side.

Shelves will be staggered to allow clearance for removal of boxes.

Locate each stud center. Drill 1/8th inch starter hole, Expand to 1/4"" hole, then use Hole Saw to cut out 2"" diameter circle. 2"" diameter used to allow for head of Plus-Nut tool. I used the step drill to open the hole up more and then finished with the Plus-Nut specified 31/64th inch drill bit. Drilling inverted (especially with the step drill) knocks out big shards of metal that will burn bare skin, wear safety googles, a long sleeve shirt, and maybe even a scarf to protect your neck.

Place laser level on ground to provide guides on where additional holes are to be drilled. Then pencil out lines and double check distances. Triple check distances and then start drilling additional holes.  
After holes are drilled and Plus-nuts installed, measure solid channel for matching holes. Use step drill to open up each hole to 1/2"" diameter. This allows a little ""wiggle room"" for inserting the 5/16th inch bolts with washers.  
Install channel with two bolts and washers in the center, then add other bolts along the length of the channel. I did this by myself, putting the first two bolts in with just a few turns, then lining up the other bolts, and finally tightening the whole channel down. Total of 9 bolts for a 10' section of channel. Each 5/16 Plus-Nut is rated for 125lbs of pull out force.   


Shelves were installed with the 1/2 channel nuts and 1/2 threaded rod (cut to 16"" lengths). I used washers and nuts to secure the tops and bottoms of all the rods.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/e5uuxn7segq31.jpg

After installation, I was able to hold on to the shelves and bounced up and down (160 pounds), and nothing moved at all. The center strut holds 5 shelves, (see top picture) and if everything was loaded to max shelf capacity of 300 lbs, this would be 1500 lbs. of weight for the 3 channels. Add the other side, and that is 3000 lbs. Currently, the shelves are holding about 500 lbs combined weight. Mostly Christmas decorations, and other large but light things.

Observations:   
Flanged bolts were most likely unnecessary, standard 5/16 hex bolts would have worked fine, especially with the 5/16 washers.  
A DIY tool for installing Plus-Nuts and Riv-Nuts is available on YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel7FllhxJM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel7FllhxJM) and it can save you money.  
Slotted channels most likely would have worked fine, as well as being cheaper and lighter.  
1"" hole saw would have been sufficient to allow Plus-Nut installation tool.  
I originally considered cutting 2"" diameter pieces of wood to use as spacers for the holes in the overhead sheetrock, but this did not end up being needed.  
I used the Ultra-Saw my wife bought me for cutting the threaded rods and channels, but a hacksaw would work in a pinch.  
I should have gotten more pictures of the channels being drilled and installed, as well as cutting the threaded rods to size.

https://i.redd.it/ynmfn5u9egq31.jpg

I was looking to get overhead storage for my garage, but all of the ""DIY"" kits state that they are not to be used with steel framed homes. I suppose this is because the hardware only uses lag bolts designed for wood. I decided I would take a chance at installing my own system. I used Plus-Nuts to hold channel struts into the ceiling, and then hung wire framed shelving with 1/2"" threaded rod.

I’m building an induction heater and button isn’t working,DIY,1,dcv7ah,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/dcv7ah/im_building_an_induction_heater_and_button_isnt/,12,1570157240.0,"I’m building an induction heater and I’m currently testing out my button. It’s a push button that’s supposed to stay on while I have it held down and then turn off once I let go. It’s connected to a 12v power supply and the induction heater is also a 12v.

As far as wiring goes, I have the blue wire connected to the red wire, which the red one is connected to the positive terminal of the induction heater. The black wire is connected to the brown wire, which the brown one is connected to both negative terminals of the induction heater and the power supply adapter. The white wire is connected to the positive terminal of the power supply adapter.

The issue is when I press the button, the LED turns on and then immediately turns off again both on the button and the induction heater. I have the wiring in their correct terminals with positive and negative, but I’m not sure what could be the issue here. I’ve also tried a second induction heater to rule it out as being the issue. The only thing I see that could be the issue is when I press the button, the power supply’s led turns off. Is it a bad power supply that’s causing this? I don’t have a second one at the moment to test this out.

In the process of finding out what should be done per code I am reading confusing things when it comes to the landing.

Per my county's code it states:

     STAIR LANDING
      If the total vertical height of a stairway exceeds 12 feet, 8 1 4"" max. riser 3 4"" - 11 4"" nosing 4"" diameter sphere shall not pass tread 9"" min. tread riser  
      Stair landings may be constructed with 4x4 posts with post heights no greater than 8 feet.
      Landing widths shall be equal to the total width(s) of the stairway(s) served. 

However, everywhere else I read talks about needing to be solid, and able to measure the slope of the surface so gravel isn't an option. Right now there are 3 stringers, the 2 outside ones are supported by 4x4 posts, however the middle on rests on the ground (barely). When I redo them I want  to make sure that there is zero issues with any inspections.

So do/should I do a concrete pad? Maybe just pavers? Digging down won't be an issue since I have a  tiller, but I'd rather not have to deal with 15 bags of concrete if I didn't have to.

Id prefer  not to use a drum sander if i dont have to it is a loooong way to home depot. but if that is an option that will work and i can rent  followed by an orbital and edger. Stain. Polyurethane. 
I don't want to pay to have this done which will probably get me some flak. 

I just want to make sure this is worth doing or if the wood may need replaced or stains too deep or wont restain well etc etc.

I have done my research but im not sure on this specific floor because of all the dark marks.

The pictures i have dont quite show how bad it is. And there is no sheen on the floor whatsoever.

Mounting a T.V. and floating entertainment shelf.

From my understanding, it is against code in most areas to run high voltage (power) chords behind the wall. So I am guessing I will need to install an outlet behind the T.V. and possibly behind the floating shelf as well. This wouldn't be too big of an issue, but as you can see in the photo, the outlet dead center on the wall is a coax outlet. The only two outlets I have on this wall are both to right and left of the coax outlet. 

I would like to hide the wires behind the wall if possible, but given the circumstances I am unsure if I will be able to while also staying in code. I know I can connect a new outlet to an existing one, but I am also guessing trying to connect a new outlet dead center will be troublesome as the two available outlets are likely separated by several studs. 

If you have any recommendations or solutions please let me know. I am fairly new to this so if I absolutely need to hire someone or just deal with some visible wiring I have no problems doing so. Thank you all in advance.

The entrance to the basement of my home has some unsightly concrete spalling. 

The drain is now higher than the spalling (and maybe was originally?), so after it rains water sits in the lowered space. 

I would like to repair the damaged area, making it level with the drain & finishing over top with an aesthetically pleasing product - maybe a waterproof epoxy grey finish? 

r/diy, how hard of a repair is this - for somebody who has never done concrete but is otherwise fairly handy? What would you do? 

As an aside - I am located in Alberta, Canada & we have very cold temperatures in the winter.

I'm trying to fix up my backyard so I don't have to keep raking it, we also have so many spiders that I can't go outdoors comfortably. It is an apartment, and we would also like to let our cat out back, so we'd like to enclose the backyard completely. But, I do have potted plants, so we can't use anything that would completely block out the sun. 

ALSO, our area is full of these aggressive mosquitos, so we would like to keep those out too. Also my fiance is 6 ft 4 in, and the top of the fence is only 6 ft, so we would need to attach something to the fence to keep it at least at 7 feet. 

We tried doing mosquito netting but it's way too loose, and I'm pretty sure I'm highly allergic since I STILL have hives on my hands.

\- Need a fabric that keeps bugs and leaves out 

\- BUT needs to let sun in for the plants

\- Need tips on how to get it a foot higher than the fence, and how to attach to apartment

Neutral to Single Pole Setup,DIY,1,dckt5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/dckt5i/neutral_to_single_pole_setup/,10,1570099103.0,"Hey diy,

&#x200B;

Looking to add a neutral wire to my switch in a single-pole setup. It looks like the neutral goes to the light first, and then the white going to the switch from the light is actually 'hot', with the black wire going back being the load. I've read the following thread and post by /u/daole: [https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/5ma6ie/add\_neutral\_to\_wall\_switches/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/5ma6ie/add_neutral_to_wall_switches/) (unfortunately archived and I can't reply there).

But essentially where I'm stuck at is this. I have into the fixture a white, black, ground. Black goes to white (wirenutted) and out to the switch, black back to the fixture. At the switch white goes to hot, black to load, and back out to the fixture into the load-in.

What I'm confused at is this: if I add 2 wires going from the switch to the fixture (white/red), at the fixture I pull the black wirenutted to the white apart and connect it to the old black (therefore, black will be hot at the switch, red will be load). Connect the red to the load on the fixture. Now at the fixture I will have 4 white wires (fixture to wirenut, white in from source, and 2 whites going to the switch receptacle), do I wirenut all 4 together? Then at the switch I will have 3 whites (switch to wirenut, 2 whites going to the fixture receptacle), do I wirenut all 3 together?

Seems to me I wouldn't really need to bring in 2 new wires, all I really need is 1 new red wire from switch to light fixture, but I guess we run the full 3 wires because they come sheathed together?

I've searched for hours to find diagrams but unfortunately there's no single pole diagram that starts at the light and passes neutral to the switch (that I can see anyway).

Thank you.","Neutral to Single Pole SetupHey diy,

I do have to mention that the torn area is fairly large, about a  2"" x 2"" piece. I'd really appreciate any recommendations. Thank you very much."

Not a great start, but I'm wondering if this is still something I can work out. He just wants a simple leaf pattern painted on the edge of the face that we can then finish to protect it. 

Is there a way to do this over the acrylic finish and have it work and not look like shit or is he asking too much?

I'm renting a house where the backyard is just extremely overgrown grass. I am going to convert it into a garden using sheet mulching. However, one corner of the grass is under the clothesline, so I want to put in something that I can stand on while hanging out the washing. What's the easiest way of doing this, considering I may only be living in this house for another year or two, so I don't really want to do any proper paving? Any help would be appreciated.

How do I tile this wall?,DIY,5,dbwe8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/dbwe8v/how_do_i_tile_this_wall/,9,1569978335.0,"Hi DIY,

I intend to tile 1 entire wall (4' x 8') of my bathroom \[remodel\] with this glass/stone mosaic stuff.

The wall is drywall with new Kilz primer applied.  This tile wall will sit behind the toilet and vanity.

1. Do I start the sheets at the bottom center?  Or at 1 corner?
2. I know that I can cut out pieces of tile from the mesh with a knife - to work around the 3 water supply pipes and the light fixture.  But what about when I want to install shelves or a towel hanger later?  Is it common to drill holes into this stuff?

FWIW,  I have a good wet saw for this job.

I don't really have access to power tools or machinery, so please consider that in your responses. Thank you all for your knowledge and assistance.","Help removing rust from an axe.Estwing Axe https://imgur.com/a/eLc1YnN

* Is the return absolutely necessary?
* Is this a reasonable price?
* Is adding an extension necessary?
* Is this something a somewhat competent homeowner can tackle themselves?

We are wondering how we should attach this towel rod so that it is able to successfully hold pots and pans that get hung on it. The screws it came with are 1 1/4"" long, but the wood is only 1"" thick. We also want the cabinet to still be usable. What are the options here? Should we go with 1/2"" screws, or nuts & bolts? Do we need to use some kind of anchors? Any advice is greatly appreciated!

The towel rod is 26"" long, and the bottom of the kitchen cabinet is 37"" long. Pictures below.

Can I drill a hole into a soffit to run the cable for a WiFi Camera?,DIY,4,dbcsns,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/dbcsns/can_i_drill_a_hole_into_a_soffit_to_run_the_cable/,10,1569884367.0,"I'm interested in installing a WiFi Camera outside of my front door. My house has a brick wall and I do not want to drill a hole through the brick for the power cord (I'm fine with drilling the mount into the brick though). Above the front door is a soffit that provides ventilation for the attic. I have a power outlet in the attic that the power cord can reach. I would just need to drill a hole through the soffit to run the cable.

Is there any reason that drilling a hole through the soffit would be frowned upon? I want to make sure that I wouldn't be messing anything up by drilling through the soffit. I figured that it wouldn't be a problem since the soffit itself already has several small holes for ventilation as it is. Below are pictures of the front door and the soffit that I'm talking about.

I'm planning to use kee klamp (or a knockoff version): https://simplifiedbuilding.co.uk/handrail/kee-klamp-handrail for the railing itself

Unfortunately, all the parts I've seen are for attaching it to a concrete path. There is a concrete path in the required location, but it is only 90cm wide, so I can't use it to fix the handrail posts without making it too narrow for bins / wheelchairs / etc.

Quick sketch:

https://imgur.com/a/6n5khXv

I have 9 posts that need to go into the ground. This is my current plan:

- I want 1m posts above ground, so I think burying 50cm should be enough. I'll therefore need 1.5m posts.
- The ground is fairly soft. I'm thinking I'll dig down most of the way with a post digger, then hammer the posts in the last few cm so they're stable enough for the next steps.
- I'll secure each in place with postcrete, leaving the level a few cm below ground so I can surround the posts with grass.

My main questions:
- Do I need to worry about the tubes filling up with water and rusting? The bottom end would be open to the soil, so I'd hope it would drain away, and the top will be pretty much sealed.
- Do I need to attach anything the the tubes to stop them pulling out vertically, or will friction be enough?
- Do I need to drill any drainage holes in the side of the tube at ground level to let water out?
- The tubes are galvanised steel, but I'll be cutting them to length myself. Do I need to coat the cut ends in any way before they go in the ground?","Securing handrail posts into soilI'm looking at installing handrail in a family member's garden and could use some advice.

Found info and 75% sure I can fix my wash machine.

HOWEVER, early in the process of pulling apart my NA-series Panasonic machine, I got eager and pulled out the blue, plastic, main agitator / pulsator disc at the base.

The screw is about 1.25"" long (3cm?) with a rubber washer seal on it.
https://bigwarehousesparesaus.appspot.com/images/646676.jpg

Upon changing my mind and trying to put the screw back in, it would only go down about half way and stop.

Picture of it here.

https://i.imgur.com/armG6gP.png

So I guess maybe, the inside where the screw goes, got water inside it?   It appears to just be a screw holding the blue plate in 


https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7WgpMFpwymI/maxresdefault.jpg

Quite similar to this.

Have I got water, down a thin shaft and nuked my primary spinning motor or have I got water in a small cavity I just need to dry out, before putting the plate back in?   (Water being incompressible) 

(My concern is the rubber washer - telling me, water should probably not go down this hole and some did)




As for the actual non draining U11 code on the washer, I actually think I'll have that solved (Bra underwire was loose inside under that pulsator / agitator plate)


Thanks any and all, the internet is great sometimes.","Trying to repair stuck wash machine, too eagerHi,

Planning on boarding up some doors/windows on a property to prevent more burglaries (seems extreme but that's what I need to do without going into specifics). 

**I have a gap that's 31"" wide. There is 2 and 1/4 inch wide wood ""frame"" on either side. (Kind of thin frame)** (and it goes deep, so i could use long screws if i need to). 

**If I board it up using 2"" x 6"" (and ~35"" long) pressure treated lumber would it resist strong kicks? (it's nominally 2"" but in reality 1.5"" thick).** On each side I'd be nailing and screwing it in with non removable screws to that 2 1/4"" frame.

This is a diagram which explains it a lot better. https://i.imgur.com/du831ja.png

I plan on painting over all the edges to make it a little harder to grab with a crowbar.

* Question: would the above plan resist being kicked in? It's 1.5"" thick of solid wood, only supported at the ends. I mean strong kicks, the type they use to kick open doors. I've seen those videos where karate guys break wood with their hands, so I'm starting to doubt whether this would be strong enough to resist hard kicks.

* Question 2: If I did the same basic design, but instead of using 2 x 6 wood, I used plywood (either 23/32"" sheathing plywood or 1/2"" ground contact plywood), would it be equally strong? more strong? less strong? 

* Question 3: What if I combined the wood and the plywood? Would it then resist kicking? I would nail the plywood to the wood and sloppily glue the plywood to the wood (I don't have clamps so the glue may not be strong).

* Question 4. What about just plywood like question 2, but 2 stacks glued together (I don't have clamps, so the glue job wouldn't be high quality, I'd probably just put random things over it like books and whatever... I don't have a lot of heavy stuff).

Now I noticed that when the keys are vertical (which they will be on the wall), there's no more gravitation pushing the hammers onto the keys. That means the keys go in their downwards position but since the hammers are not pushing against that, the keys remain there, as if pushed down permanently.

I am now looking for ideas how to keep them in the initial position. First I thought to lock them down with screws. Thats easy but I wont be able to push them any more, so I am trying to find something which will push them back.

This is how it looks below they keys:

I have two ideas so far which have both their downside: 
&nbsp;

1. put some kind of foamy/spongy marterial below, so I can push the keys down and they go up again. It's easy/cheap, but I bet that the feeling would not be even close to pushing the keys on a functioning piano and also fear that the foam might not endure long time.

2. Spings! but it will be hard to find fitting ones and I am not 100% sure how to twirl them around the metal peg:

Putting up temporary/fake wall into an apartment without screwing into the ceiling.,DIY,3,dayvj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/dayvj1/putting_up_temporaryfake_wall_into_an_apartment/,10,1569809702.0,"The room is the basement of a duplex, with a spiral staircase opening to the living room above. This means light and sound go right from one room to the other. One side can be done easily without any help, some curtains would be added, but the other side needs a little ingenuity. 

We don't have to be fancy, plywood is a fine start, and it can be decorated from there


The ceiling is only about 7', so not particularly high, which is actually an asset for this project. I was thinking about putting furniture feet pads on to the ceiling to stop scuffing, though I need to figure out how to properly stand the board up. 

I was thinking about wedging the plywood on either side of it to keep it up and even, but that doesn't really sound that logistical. Maybe adding 8th-inch plywood down on the bottom until it creates a proper lift. 

No ideas are bad ones.","Putting up temporary/fake wall into an apartment without screwing into the ceiling.The room is the basement of a duplex, with a spiral staircase opening to the living room above.

In my country DIY working is not so popular like on USA. Main reason, we all living in condos. The second reason, craft tools are very expensive in our market compared to salaries.That why you can't find on Youtube something about modern forniture. I mean all pro woodworkers haven't time for this things or they are living in old time-vibes

What am I doing in Moscow? I love wood and plywood. I love to teach people (I have a master's degree in optical physics. I spent 7 years in training technicians and clients in managing complex CNC machines. I was the best on the course and in my company)And now i'm training people how to work with wood. We have few coworking centers in Moscow but it still expensive for most of all.

My solution is to find support from equipment dealers.

And I almost found her. We agreed with one of the Jet and Kreg Tool dealers for support. But they want me to develop my media channels, in particular YouTube.

And after fulfilling these conditions, I will be able to receive financial support for holding free seminars for everyone. And this is my goal, to popularize it in my country. to show that you can do nice stuf with your own hands. Make it from wood. To show that it's easy. It is nice and interesting.

https://i.redd.it/l8r288933pp31.jpg

So. in this case, I start filming a video on my YouTube channel.

What am I asking you, check this out and give me advice on what I should improve on my videos.

Well, you are more competent and sophisticated in the quality and quantity of the content, so I turn to Reddit for advice.

Thank you in advance. I will read and accept all criticism. Do not be afraid to be cruel in it.

P.S. about my project. I made it from plywood. And he used zebrano for a box. There is also a push-on system under drawer like this

My reasoning is that I dont want to be building transformers and pairing them with a variac without really knowing what I'm doing (I'm an engineer but not of the electrical persuasion).

Recessed screw turning but won’t come out.,DIY,0,dawu2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/dawu2u/recessed_screw_turning_but_wont_come_out/,14,1569800743.0,"https://imgur.com/a/5FtI0ho

My cordless vacuum has been acting a little temperamental and the manufacturers advice is to check on the battery connections.  In order to remove the battery, I need to remove a couple screws.  The one in the image is turning but not really coming out at all.  It’s partially unscrewed and feels a little loose.  

Generally the research I’ve done so far suggested using a flathead screw driver to pull from behind the head of the screw or using pliers, but because this is recessed by about 1/2” I can’t do that.  I’ve also tried holding it upside down while I screw (hoping gravity will help) and used strong magnet, with no success.

Any advice?","Recessed screw turning but won’t come out.https://imgur.com/a/5FtI0ho

Please chime in on anything you have any experience on. I appreciate all opinions and thoughts. 

1. Asbestos ducts in the attic; one duct is crushed or stepped on and a potential health hazard. I'm hiring an asbestos removal company to remove the ducts, and then hiring someone to install it. One ducting company offered to do everything cheap, but when he showed up and I asked him about the procedure and it seemed very shady. No negative air pressure setup and he tried to say asbestos isn't dangerous. I kicked him to the curb right away. 
2. Attic insulation is the loose type and most likely has asbestos attached to it since everyone the warranty company sent out to fix that ONE duct needed to turn on the AC.
3. Furnace might be leaking gas. Still need to make appointment with gas company to come check. 
4. Pinhole leak behind shower. This is a funny story. When I first moved in, I remember thinking that my neighbors water their lawns a bit too much; I'd hear the sprinklers going off at all hours of the day. One late night I took a shower and heard the sprinklers on. After my shower, it was still on. In the middle fo the night when I had to use the restroom, it was STILL on. That's when I panicked and checked outside. Nope. No sprinklers. Just a bit of wetness on the other side of my wall where the stucco meets the concrete. All last week, I've been dealing with the insurance company and warranty company. 
5. Miscellaneous landscaping issues but I'll deal with that later. 

**Now, this is what I'm currently working on and need input/ideas/thoughts from all you wonderful DIY-ers.** 

1. Asbestos ducts - I'm hiring a company to do both removal and installation of ducting. They'll contract out to a licensed asbestos removal company and then come in a few days later to install. 
2. IN BETWEEN DUCT REMOVAL AND INSTALLATION, I'm renting an insulation vacuum and redoing the insulation. I plan on getting the goggles and respirator; just checked that the respirator I have is not meant for asbestos. Will need some suggestions. 
3. I've semi-decided on stone vinyl planks with 5.5mm and 0.5mm top layer (20 mil or something like that). This would be for everywhere EXCEPT bathrooms and MAYBE kitchen. 

I've started drinking so I apologize and thank you beforehand.","Back again for advice - checklist of things that needs to be doneI'm so disappointed. I thought I got a great bargain but it turns out I just didn't know what to look for.

The walls are single breeze blocks and the floor was unsealed concrete, but unfortunately after sealing the floor life got in the way and the project was shelved.  
Fast forward to now and I'm eager to get the job done, especially before the cold / damp really kicks in this year.  
I work as a cabinet maker so have a fair understanding of tools / wood, but apart from putting up a small stud wall a few years back I've never done any constructional work.  
I figured I'd start on the floor as it's likely the easiest part, then move onto the walls from there.

My goal is pretty much to copy what this guy has done [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR8SqpguwzM) - 2x4's laid across the floor, fill the gaps with some insulation, slap a vapour barrier down over the top and cover the whole thing with 18mm sheets, leaving ~10mm around each edge.

My main questions here are:  
1. How should I secure the shims / boards to the floor? He says in the comments something about spaghetti screws, but I can't seem to find that outside of Australia.  
2. He puts plastic under the shims which makes sense, but then if you screw through that won't the screw break the seal?  
3. He also fills the gaps between the shims with what seems like [SikaFlex](https://www.uksealants.co.uk/sikaflex-ebt-adhesive-sealant-filler.html), although I'm guessing at which type exactly. I'm going to have lathes / bandsaws running on parts of the floor so I'm thinking it'd definitely needed in some places, but doing the whole floor with it would cost a fortune.

"looking for cement board VS membrane advice for tiling over wood subfloor, on top of my fired contractors screwed up attempt",DIY,18,dahusw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/dahusw/looking_for_cement_board_vs_membrane_advice_for/,38,1569715291.0,"good morning,

i have an old ass house. built in 1932. and i'm wanting to tile the floor of what will become the mud room.

hired a guy who seemed legit, and claimed plenty of experience w/tiling. i have since learned otherwise and let him go.

unfortunately, i was dumb enough that it took him fucking up half the tile job for me to figure things out.

so! dear DIYers of reddit, now i've got some questions.

this is all happening on a wood floor, on wood joists : diagonal lumber sub floor, with plywood over the top.

the real issue is that the floor had/has linoleum over the plywood. about a 2/3s of which was removed when asbestos mastic was discovered. the whole floor was then covered in an encapsulate and then half-assed leveled by my former contractor.

the floor is lumpy and saggy, as we all get to be when we're almost 100 years old.

squeaks like hell when you walk around, so there's obvious movement happening.

my plan is to rip out the shitty tile, scrape the floor down a bit, *correctly* pour on leveler and then do the tile.

i'm fine with a membrane solution like Ditra, or a traditional durock product.

that being said, the 1/8"" thickness of Ditra, and the ease of installation make it seem like a better choice, even at the higher price. but i'm concerned about whether it will be the strongest option considering the age and condition of the floor in general.

durock gets screwed into the subfloor, so i think it may be better able to resist the flexing that i'm sure will still be present even after the leveler is applied.

any advice?

thanks!

durock gets screwed into the subfloor, so i think it may be better able to resist the flexing that i'm sure will still be present even after the leveler is applied.

any advice?

thanks!

Attic Insulation DIY Questions!,DIY,5,damo9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/damo9z/attic_insulation_diy_questions/,10,1569737647.0,"Hello!

I'm about to embark on my first DIY project of insulating my attic. I received some mixed opinions on quite a few things, so i thought i would consult the experts of reddit to give the final say. I've attached some photos, and here are my questions:

\- I've got recessed lighting throughout the attic (about 8 unites with 1000 sq feet). The lights seem to be IC rated when i look up the units online, but they don't say anything about that on the actual unites when I examine them in the attic. It's not super easy to get up close to them ( very small ceilings). I guess i'm just paranoid. My question is: Should i still try to air seal these with a cover? Or will i be okay?

\- If i choose not to seal the recessed lights, how should i go about marking where they are since i'll have about 12 inches of insulation and they'll be covered. Also, how would i go about marking other things like fans or electrical boxes? Is that something that is normally done?

\-There's a bunch cables scattered throughout as well as electrical boxes.

\- Can the bathroom fan unit be covered with cellulose insulation as well? I assume there's no fire hazard there.

Looking for some advice about a Yale lock.,DIY,6,dam5pu,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/dam5pu/looking_for_some_advice_about_a_yale_lock/,5,1569735013.0,"Looking for a quick bit of advice about a lock.

Firstly, thanks for taking the time to read this. 

I know it’s going to be difficult to diagnose the problem without actually seeing it - but I’m just looking for a bit of advice. I have a Yale lock on my front door - about 4-5 years old and I noticed recently the handle (on the inside of the house) is a little loose. Nothing major - maybe 3/4mm give all around. I can wiggle it a bit - maybe I only just noticed but it seemed quite tight before. It doesn’t feel not secure - but it feels a little loose. I’ve looked up the problem, but all the advice is a little vague.

Secondly, on the outside - where I put the key in there is maybe another 3/4mm of turn before I feel any resistance to indicate the mechanism is kicking into action. I don’t notice this before - but maybe I just wasn’t paying attention. 

Couple of questions - is this a worry? Should I call someone out to take a look at the lock? I’m going away next month and someone is coming over every day with a key and don’t want it to break on them.

Secondly - is this something I can fix myself? I’m fairly DIY savvy I think. Is this just a case of removing the lock and tightening some screws? 

Any advice would be great - but I would totally understand if the only advice is get a professional to take a look.

When I bought my house, the property behind us had tall trees and foliage to sock in our yard with shade, green, and just peace. Recently the neighbor cut down all the trees and wants to build another house behind us. This really screwed us, because my yard sharply drops off about 1-2 foot from our actual property line in some areas, and the top of our fence is only about 4 ft from the yard level where the yard is.

I’ve gotten a few quotes and having a professional do a retaining wall to raise our property so we can actually put a normal size fence up is too expensive. I am going to have to do this myself, terrifying but also after watching YouTube I feel like I could do it. I just have a few specific questions that I was wondering if anyone can help with.

There are already stones that are “relatively” flat that come up about 1-2 ft from the previous owners of the house that is on our property line. The current fence is 1-2 ft in front of that, so the goal would be to build that wall up, fill it with dirt and put a new fence where we get all our land and fence height. All the videos I’ve seen talk about digging your base and setting gravel/blocks at the bottom about ~9” under ground level. My neighbor said that he thought they did that with these stones, but I have no real way of checking.

1) how can someone check previous stones to see if it’s a good base to build a wall on top of? I was just gonna dig in front of it and see if it laid properly.

2) if it’s a good base, would it be better to build the wall on top of that (would definitely be easier) or is it always best practice to rip up old stone and start fresh?

3) if I have to start fresh, how on earth am I supposed to get the original stones out? Jackhammer?

4) if I use the original base, what can I do to make my first level of stone secure and level? I was thinking of mortaring the first blocks on the stone and putting drain pipes in.

Any help would be appreciated.

Edit: some guys at church were saying that since my stone base is pretty stable (I think), I can just mortar the first level of blocks to the stone and make sure that the first row is level. I’d make sure to put drain tubes throughout and am planning on putting a drain pipe at the base of 6” of gravel behind the wall. Drainage shouldn’t be a problem.

2. For the island, wood butcher blocks seem to be the most affordable option. We are leaning towards a navy blue finishing for the island with a wood countertop. 

3. How hard is this if my girlfriend and I have absolutely zero experience in all of this? Also, how hard is it to install a built-in microwave into the island?

I found [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/85wIbNGNLVk) for a faux farmhouse tabletop to place over a folding table. 

I was thinking I could make these 12 ft long & slip them on a 6ft or 8ft folding table, with smaller blocks of 1x3 underneath to frame the smaller table, so the top wouldn't slide around. 

Am I insane to think this would work? Would the 3ft overhang on the end cause the tabletop to tip if someone leaned on it? If I made them from inexpensive pine, would I have to worry about warping in such a long project? Are there questions I'm not even asking that I should be?

(woodworking wedding table diy)I want farmhouse tables for my wedding, but they're pricey to rent. I found [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/85wIbNGNLVk) for a faux farmhouse tabletop to place over a folding table. 

I was thinking I could make these 12 ft long & slip them on a 6ft or 8ft folding table, with smaller blocks of 1x3 underneath to frame the smaller table, so the top wouldn't slide around.

How do I get the bottom of my deck stairs (stringers) out of standing water?,DIY,3,da6sjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/da6sjd/how_do_i_get_the_bottom_of_my_deck_stairs/,9,1569648254.0,"I've got a back deck with wooden stairs coming down onto the driveway. The whole area is asphalt (AFAIK). The problem is, the bottom of the stringers are sitting in a little valley where water collects in the rainy winters. The stringers were so rotted the the entire bottom step broke off. So I'm about to put in new stringers but I haven't done a lot of this type of work. What are my options to keep the stringers (and adjoining posts) high and dry? 

I could try to re-grade that area but I'm not sure how that would go. Just forward of the little gulley the stringers are sitting in, the ground levels off so there's nowhere obvious for the water to be directed. 

Could the stringers sit on top of a masonry brick product of some sort that's lifts them a few inches? Would I just trim the bottom of the stringers by the height of the masonry? Alternatively, could I mix up some cement and fill in the valley?

I want to install a shower valve there, so I would need to cut the caps off and then solder in the valve.

Before doing that, I figure I need to turn off the water, so I went downstairs and found what I assume is the valve in my boiler room. I closed it, then waited a while, then to check, I turned on my faucet in the kitchen.

Water is still coming out of the faucet, albeit significantly reduced rate. Not quote a trickle, but close. However, I cant turn the value anymore than it's already turned, so I cant close it any more.

I'm worried that if I try to cut the caps off those pipes upstairs, a little water will still be flowing in them, and then I'll be stuck with water spilling into my walls, since I wont be able to solder anything with water coming out of the pipe.

Custom shower pan issues!,DIY,1,da5aev,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/da5aev/custom_shower_pan_issues/,3,1569641403.0,"Alright, so we need a custom size shower pan and have the intention of pouring a custom one with mortar. I know I need a ratio of 5 part sand to 1 part concrete, but also understanding the commercial Quikrete sand/concrete 60lb bag is a 3:1.

The Main Issue:
Pan is going on a concrete floor in a basement. We had the pipes put into the floor and everything is already sealed and concrete has been poured over the top BUT it was done wrong and our show drain is now level with the basement floor, not elevated to allow space for the first pour.

Is it best to:
A) do the first pour and narrow it down feather thin to the drain, use additional specified epoxies and hardeners from the manufacturer,  and continue on with the membrane and second pour.

B) do the first pour, but leave a few inches around the drain itself to avoid the feather thin mortar. Fill said area with caulk/epoxy under the shower membrane.

I've looked at shower systems too. But same issue. I cant find any special part to partially extend the PVC drain up and allow the needed clearance.

Need to know what would be best to have under all those layers so I dont have a shift underneath that ruptures my shower membrane or causes total collapse on my tile floors once finished.","Custom shower pan issues!Alright, so we need a custom size shower pan and have the intention of pouring a custom one with mortar.

Is this a valid concern, and if so how do I get around it? Will I need to build a box roller and attach the casters to it, and then attach the cabinet to it?

The empty weight of the cabinet is ~98lbs. Loaded weight is expected around ~140lbs.
