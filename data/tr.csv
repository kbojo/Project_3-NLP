First, some housekeeping:

1. **""What is sleep-training?""** - It has come to my attention that there are some concerns about what constitutes ""sleep-training"" and what doesn't. Sleep-training should involve a method of some kind - disappearing chair, extinction, intervals, etc. I don't want to be hyper-specific here, but let's be intelligent about this and not resort to hyperbole like ""Well, if you beat your child so they stay quiet at night, is that a 'method'?"" This is silly. We're adults - we can figure this kind of stuff out without me being too prescriptive.

1. **Don't be shy - flag and message!** - Please remember that there are ways to flag posts and comments for me to review. I have not received any flags at all in over a month. In the past year, I've received less than 10 (this includes private messages to me). I can only fix what I'm made aware of. Please message me or flag comments/posts so I can review!

New Rule:

I am going to be creating a new rule for this sub: **/r/sleeptrain only supports sleep-training a baby who is at least 4 months old.** Posts can be created for ""pre-training"" questions (i.e. ""How do I create a schedule for my baby?"" or ""What books would you recommend?"") if you are preparing for sleep-training a baby who is not yet old enough for it.

Our son is nearly 7 months old. He slept great initially (as they so often do) and was doing 1 feed during the night then going back in his bassinet. Then 4 months hit and overnight we went to 5 feeds a night, and in the sidecar bassinet (it's convertible). Then about a month ago suddenly we were up every 90 minutes, and he won't sleep on his own. So now we cosleep and I have to go to bed with him because he won't sleep by himself. Sometimes I can sneak away but not for long. My husband and I take turns being with him during the night. Sometimes when my husband has him he can soothe him back to sleep, but most of the time I nurse him back to sleep. He only gets about 1.5 hours of naps a day because he rarely sleeps longer than one cycle. And they are all on me. We have a bedtime routine that's pretty much just bath, moisturise, pjs and nurse to sleep. I hold him for over an hour so I don't have to go to bed at 6:30-7pm.

We. Are. Miserable. My marriage is suffering, pretty sure our baby is suffering from not getting a good sleep, and I am so fucking tired. My husband is so tired. 

He's been keen to sleep train for a while but I'm dragging my feet because it kills me to leave him to cry. We did 10 minutes the other night and by the time it was over the baby was congested, hiccuping and just sobbing. It was horrible. I really can't leave him to CIO and do full extinction. Patting and shushing does nothing and never has, since he was born. I'd be willing to try it again though. But usually it's pick up or bust. 

I have a basic knowledge of Ferber, and thought that is probably what we have to do. But I don't really know. There are many resources and I get overwhelmed. And I feel like a terrible person for nursing him to sleep all this time then suddenly ripping it away. Please help me.","We want to sleep train and would like advice on howThis is our situation:

3mo sleeping well; anticipating 4mo regression,sleeptrain,7,dguvao,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/dguvao/3mo_sleeping_well_anticipating_4mo_regression/,9,1570914137.0,"First time mom to a baby boy and happy to find this subreddit! I’ve read through a few threads already but have some questions. 

He’s 12 weeks old today and has been mostly sleeping from 930-9 with one wake up around 4/5 for a feed for 3 weeks now. He already sleeps in his own area in our living room. Baseline is 6 hours for long stretch and has hit 9 hours 3x! Naps are a crapshoot (some days he naps well some days he refuses) but daytime sleep doesn’t seem to affect his nighttime sleep. I’m dreading the 4 mo regression and plan to sleep train (CIO) when it hits. 

1. Right now our nightly routine is usually bath (every other day), jammies, bottle then bed. He does go down drowsy but awake after the bottle but does that still create a feeding association? When do we have to switch the order? If we stop and he doesn’t go down as easily, and we need to rock him doesn’t that create another association? 

2. I’ve read that some babies hit the regression early at 3.5 months or so. Is that too early for sleep training? I’ll say he seems to be able to self soothe sometimes because he’ll wake up and cry at around 6 am sometimes and we can turn the white noise on louder without going to him and he’ll fall back asleep. This doesn’t always happen though. 

3. Since he’s established a baseline for his night feed time would I just let him cry any other time he wakes up before then when the training begins (assuming he’s hits his regression)? 

4. He’s still currently swaddled to sleep (love to dream) because the Moro reflex is still strong and he’s not rolling. Assuming that stays the same would you recommend keeping him swaddled for training? If so, would I need to restart once we unswaddle him? Or should we just take the swaddle away from him as well and kill two birds with one stone. 

5. We sometimes use a pacifier to help him go to sleep and will take it out right before we put him down (he can’t keep it in and will wake up if it falls out). I think I know the answer to this one but should we stop doing that? 

6. Taking Cara Babies says his bed time should be between 7-8 but the issue is we live in a one bedroom (NYC living) and he sleeps in a partitioned “room” in the living room so we’d be trapped in the bedroom by 8 if he goes to bed so early which I guess is fine for a week or two during training. Once he’s trained are we ok to be in the living room making light light noise and not mess with his sleep? Once I go back to work however I often won’t be home for bedtime if he goes to bed at 8. Anyone else do well with a later bedtime?

I’ve never experienced this before. I’ve usually had kids transition down to a shorter nap before they drop. And this seems very early to me.

The lack of nap had been off and on. She was taking a nap every two days or so for a week or two, but now she’s sleeping longer at night and not napping at all.

We’ve kept her 8pm bedtime (in bed at 8, asleep by 8:15ish) hoping this was temporary. She would previously wake about 6:15 or 6:30am, but she has started sleeping in until 7:30 or 8.  So it looks like she’s approaching sleeping 12 hours at night. And she’s getting through to around 7:30pm without being fussy or overtired.

Is there any hope of keeping her nap? I thought I had at least another year of some napping. I’m pregnant and exhausted and I need that time to nap, too! 

She will go into her crib for “quiet time” but I can’t sleep through all the chatter. And I’m not keen on her hanging out awake in her crib unsupervised. She hasn’t tried to climb out yet, but she’s quite the gymnast and I am concerned she will try eventually.","26 month old dropping nap. Is it hopeless?My 26 month old recently started going into her crib for nap but playing for an hour to an hour and a half and not sleeping. After 75-90 min she will call for me saying she’s awake, like she used to do after an actual nap.

Previously she was taking a 2-2.5 hour nap daily.

Naps he is all over the board, but for the most part he naps around 10 and 2 or 11 and 3, for an hour each time. Does not matter when he wakes up in the morning. The problem is he has never slept through the night,  usually wanting to feed every 2 hours or so. Except my husband took him when I had an overnight stay in the hospital and...he didn't need to eat. He had 2 bottles in 12 hours. My husband gave him a little sip of water and he went back to sleep. He took him again last week to get me some sleep, same thing. He doesnt need to feed.  But now he is up every hour, almost on the dot, until early morning.  We still give him sips, sometimes he just needs a binky, but it's still every hour. He sometimes sleeps better in the living room,  so we tried adding a humidifier to the bedroom,  and mimicking the sound of the fish tanks in the living room for white noise, and it seems very random whether it works or not. I feel like there is just something that if I could figure it out, we could be ok. Could it really be he is just thirsty?

He doesnt always need the binky,  and I try not to offer it to him unless he is truly wanting it. He can sleep through noise and light, but I do try to make the room dark and quiet so he knows it is bedtime. He falls asleep fairly easily now, and he doesn't need one particular way/location to put him to sleep. 

I don't know that I am ready for formal sleep training yet, but I still want to try and promote healthy bedtime routines. Is there a possibility that I am missing, something that he needs, or is it just time to try a method?","Long back storySo my son is 6.5 months old.

Nap training approach,sleeptrain,1,dglc6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/dglc6r/nap_training_approach/,1,1570856903.0,"I am attempting nap training with my 6 month old and don’t know what I’m doing. I picked up Pantleys No Cry Sleep Solution and right now I’m working on extending naps.

Prior to this, DD would take 40 minute naps 4 times a day (she can barely be up for two hours without needing another nap). I’d like to get her napping for longer since she hasn’t seemed to consolidate on her own. I’m hoping tackling this first will lay a good foundation for night time (she still gets up 4-6 times per night needing help to get back to sleep). For now we are avoiding CIO and trying some no cry solutions to see if it will help us.

Yesterday is when I really started on the naps. I have always rocked her to sleep and then set her down in her crib, and she would do her 30-40 minutes then wake. So I started to intervene just before she wakes to try and get her back to sleep. The only way this works is to rocked her again. Today I said screw it, I might as well hold her for the entire nap instead of the up and down in the middle. I’m hoping this will teacher her body to extend sleep cycles during the day by itself.

Does this seem logical? I’m hoping after just a week or two of holding her for naps they get longer. Yesterday and today I’ve been able to get her taking 2 two-hour naps! If I do this at the same times everyday will it help her body learn the schedule I would like? Will holding her for a two hour nap undo progress I have made by setting her down? (Sometimes setting her down doesn’t even work cuz she can’t fall asleep in the crib yet).

To throw another fun task in I’m trying to wean her from the paci. I’m taking it out just as she’s falling asleep so she breaks the association.

It was a rocky ride but she slept through the night and stopped crying at bedtime. 

Up until a few nights ago she was sleeping 10.5-11.5hrs straight through with no wake ups. Her naps were two a day, approximately 2hrs 10mins total.

Now it is a nightmare. She wakes about 30-45mins after bedtime and then anywhere from 30mins to 1.5hrs later crying. She is quickly soothed and goes back to sleep (I pick her up briefly and lay her back down). But she has been doing this for a few nights now and I am exhausted and at a loss as to what to do.

We thought it might be teething as we can see some white coming through on the teeth before her molars and maybe even her molars (she already has 8 teeth). But I thought she wouldn’t be so easily soothed if it is teething?

I read that it might be crap naps, but our experience before is that when she napped closer to 3 hours during the day she slept worse at night... today she got 2.5hours so I don’t know? Naps have been a crapshoot tho and I’ve returned to holding her for part of her nap(s) if it looks like she won’t get enough sleep. I’m so paranoid about her being overtired.

Sorry for the wall of text. I’m at a loss... if you have any experience with this or any advice, I’d love to hear it?

Edit: wanted to add... it isn’t always a quick soothe. I’ve been up with her now for nearly 1.5hrs. This happened 3 nights ago too. She seems comforted when I pick her up, but when I lie her back down one of two things happens: (1) she either cries straight away, or (2) I can leave the room but she doesn’t go back to sleep and eventually ends up crying again.

What to do with an almost two year old who nurses to sleep?,sleeptrain,2,dfr1en,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/dfr1en/what_to_do_with_an_almost_two_year_old_who_nurses/,18,1570700742.0,"So I'd resolved to just wait until he outgrows it on his own but I'm reaching my breaking point with this.

Just as background info I've attempted to sleeptrain at 5 and 8 months unsuccessfully. Now at 23 months I nurse my boy to sleep in my bed and then sneak away once he's asleep. Usually he'd sleep until about midnight this way so I'd get the rest of the evening to relax. Lately he either won't let me sneak away or he will wake again after 20-45 mins. I usually nurse him back to sleep and he'll wake up once or twice a night. He doesn't nurse much during the day (and I work full time) so I think he is basically reverse cycling with his nursing. I don't mind the couple of night waking because they are brief, and don't mind bedsharing, but having to be with him all evening is getting really old.

Our usual bedtime routine is bath, pajamas, bedtime song, books, milk, and I have some lullabies I play while he falls asleep.

I don't want to do extinction or cry it out methods, but not sure if there's anything else that might help. I thought maybe if I move the milk earlier and then rub his back and play lullabies instead of milk and lullabies (but I know he is going to protest lots!)

Also he's a night owl and sleep fighter so even the nursing sometimes takes 30+ minutes. 

Am I doomed to just wait until he's a teenager and presents a whole new set of problems!!? 🙃","What to do with an almost two year old who nurses to sleep?So I'd resolved to just wait until he outgrows it on his own but I'm reaching my breaking point with this.

My wife and I are going to start sleep training our 4 month old in a few days and we want to be fully prepared for the battle that awaits. We plan on using the Ferber method, and I think we have a pretty solid bed time routine in place so I'm hoping that makes the transition earlier. Generally we get the PJs on, feed, story time and put him in his crib (not in the same room as us). Whole process takes about 20 minutes and he's in his bed by 7:30pm. Some general questions for the group:

1. If he wakes up at 1am, how do you make the distinction between a crying hungry baby and a crying 'I want to be comforted' baby? At 4 months he still could need the odd night time feed but we also want to avoid 'feeding to put to sleep'
2. In the event our little guy cries, we go in at the 3 minute mark, comfort for a minute or two, then leave. If he's quiet for 20 minutes, then starts up again, do we go back to the 3 minute interval or would we use the next interval?
3. You hear/read sleep training should start at 6 months, are we cruel for wanting to start it now?

Feedback on plan for 5 month old: extinction while keeping a night feed?,sleeptrain,6,df1g46,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/df1g46/feedback_on_plan_for_5_month_old_extinction_while/,8,1570576912.0,"At 3.5 months, we had a pretty great (for her age) sleeper. Nursed around 8pm, followed by jammies, book, and into her pack N play next to our bed between 8:30 and 9. She'd fuss or cry for 10-15 min, then be sound asleep. Often was quiet all through the night except for one waking to feed, usually around 2 a.m.

Then I went back to work, she went to daycare, started getting sick a lot, had some issues with refusing to eat at daycare followed by constant nursing in the evenings and nights, throw in the 4 month regression for fun... Sleep was a total disaster for several weeks. 

We recently realized that she's become a much lighter sleeper to the extent that our noises were waking her up constantly, so she moved into her own room last week. Sleep is still pretty disturbed, though: She's waking up and needing the binky replaced at least 3-4 times a night (on top of our longer waking for the night feed).

Naps: She's not a great napper but generally gets 3 naps a day (two naps at daycare are apparently usually pretty good, often an hour or longer, though naps at home still tend to be short, 30-40 minutes).

She's finally starting to eat a bit better at daycare, so I'm feeling more comfortable getting serious about improving our nights now.  I'd like to maintain one night feed, mainly for hydration purposes.  Our doc has given the green light for sleep training but not much guidance on how to get there. Our current tentative plan looks something like this:

* Move last nursing up to 7:30 and try to have her in bed by 8

* Don't go into the room until a waking after 2, then do a feed and change

* Don't go into the room again until morning (obviously barring any safety issues that we'll be checking with a video monitor)

Some questions:

Does this seem like a reasonable start? What would you change or add?

Is the night feed creating an association / reward for crying? Do I try to handle that by getting in there before she actually starts to cry? 

What has been your experience with the binky in a plan like this? During the day when she's wide awake she seems quite capable of manipulating it and retrieving it from next to her head, but she often seems to need (or want) it replaced for her at night. Should we try to ditch it now, or just give it to her once at the start of the night and let her handle things on her own from there? 

Any feedback / advice welcome!

I've done a lot of googling and reading but still can't pinpoint any information that might be able to help our specific case. Our son is 7 months old and in general, he's a good sleeper, however, it's his daily 2-3am wake up that's killing us. 

The typical nightly routine is changing his diaper, putting his onesie on, and taking him upstairs to his room to feed him 4 oz before putting him in his crib. He always falls asleep in our arms while we're feeding him. He'll then sleep until 2-3am every night where he'll wake us up by crying. We've tried to let him cry it out and soothe himself but that hasn't worked. We don't change his diaper at 2-3am as we we treat this as a ""business feed"". It does work, he'll go right back to sleep and then wake up again around 6am which is perfect because we need to get up for work anyways. I want to cut out this 2-3am wakeup though as it's been taking a big toll on my wife and I. Maybe he's just not ready? I'm not sure.

If you were in this situation, what did you do to cut out that middle of the night wake up?

When will my kid stop crying/screaming himself to sleep?!,sleeptrain,1,decqhp,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/decqhp/when_will_my_kid_stop_cryingscreaming_himself_to/,9,1570440983.0,"So, we sleep trained my little around 9 months. It went okay, not great but it was okay. We started with Ferber & ended up having to do extension after a month because checking in him just made him angrier. 

Around 13 months we started dealing with early morning wake ups & couldn’t get them to stop (he would wake between 4:30 & 5 daily & would just scream in his crib until we came in around 6). 

We dropped down to one nap a day around 15 months. 

We had our second kid around 16 months. 

He stopped doing the early morning wake ups when we brought his brother home. Not sure what changed but he started sleeping until 6:15/6:30 daily. 

We have (in the last month) started screaming ourselves to sleep for both naps & bedtime. He is currently 19 months. & occasionally have an early morning wake up 

Our schedule is -

5:00-6:30 wake up time - it depends daily & we can’t figure out what causes the earlier wake ups. 

11:30 - 12 down for nap (he is in his crib nlt 12noon daily). 

- he has consistently been sleeping for 90 minutes, no matter when we put him down 

So wake up is between 1-1:30. 

Start bedtime routine around 6:15pm. 
Bedtime routine consists of bath time, nursing, reading three books, our version of bedtime prayers & laying down awake in our crib between 6:45-7. 

He will read/talk/hangout in his crib for 15-30 minutes & then start screaming & crying for us. He will continue on for anywhere of 10-60 minutes. 

Once he does finally fall asleep he is usually down for the night. Occasionally he will make noise in his crib, but doesn’t wake up & expect to see us, until his early morning wake up. 


I’m seriously at a loss. I have no idea what I’m doing g wrong or how to get it so my kid isn’t crying himself to sleep nightly.

We started using the crib last night bc doc said he's too big for the bassinet. Normally DH uses the bassinet and I cosleep on my shift. DH can  get him down at 8-830 and he'll stay down until 1130-12. This held true in the crib. He asked that I try to stop cosleeping, and I reluctantly agreed (lack of sleep is a huge ppd issue for me). LO woke up at 230, 310, 4, and 445.

Around 6 months, we sleep trained him and he's taken to it well--we can always put him in his crib drowsy or sometimes completely awake and he either talks to himself for a while before going to sleep or he cries for up to ten minutes and falls asleep.  This works for bedtime and naps.  We were never able to do the checks--we just had to leave him to cry and figure it out when we were training.  Checks seem to enrage him.  

At the time we sleep trained, he was waking about twice a night--usually sometime around 1am and then sometime around 4am, and I just fed him and put him back down to sleep.  However, the wake ups are getting worse and I'd love suggestions or guidance on night weaning.  Right now, he has a wakeup between 10:30 and 11:30 that we always ignore, and it's always about 8 minutes of crying and he goes back to sleep.  I had sort of figured after a week of ignoring that one would just go away and we could go to work on the next one, but it hasn't gone away despite the fact that we ignore it.  Then he also has the 1am and 4am wakeup, which I haven't ignored yet though I've given it ten minutes or so of crying to see if he'll just fall back asleep (this never works).  Then there are also the nights (like last night) where he wakes up literally every 90-120 minutes--DEAR GOD WHY?!  Obviously he's not hungry every one of those times, but I nurse him for a few minutes and put him back.  I've tried slowly reduce the amount of time I nurse, and though he's not happy about it he'll accept it.  But it also seems like then he wakes up more frequently to make up for the lost milk.  Dream feeds make no difference.  

Am I down to total extinction being my only option here?  How do I pick the amount of time for that?  For reference, he goes to bed around 8 (and tends to be up for the day around 8:15 in the mornings).  I'm having a hard time gearing myself up for the amount of crying that will require, but I guess it's not like I'm sleeping well now. 

My older son never did this--as soon as we sleep trained, he dropped wakeups on his own until we were just left with a 5am-er, which I kept around forever so we could all sleep until 7:30.

He normally goes to bed at night fairly easy —minimal fussing or none. Still has one or two night feedings (varies) and a dream feed and goes to sleep right after. 

Bedtime routine is bath, lotion, pjs, bottle, swaddle, bassinet (his swaddle clips on his bassinet so it’s still safe to do it).


Moving the bottle to before bath is tricky —he already eats before his bath, but still needs another 4oz of so to tank up and get his calories.

I know I read a bunch of times that ST doesn’t equal weaning ... but can it? I have a hard time getting more calories into him during the day, he doesn’t like to drink big bottles . Even on the rare occasion he has STTN and skipped feedings he doesn’t really make up for it the next day. On days he manages to eat more, he still wakes up to eat at his normal times. Schedule is:

Wake up between 6.30 and 7.30.

First nap 1.5 hours after that.

Around 2 hours of WT and second nap

A 3rd nap may or may not happen (I can never get him down in his bassinet —if it happens, it’s a stroller, bouncer or car seat nap).

6.15 bedtime routine 

6.45 pm-7 Pm asleep 

9.30 pm dream feed 

nights usually go one of two ways:

Wake between 2.30/3.30 eat, sleep until 6.30 and be up for the day.

Or

Wake around between 2.30-3.30, eat, wake again around 5 am, eat, sleep until 7.30 and be up for the day. 


We had a pretty brutal 4 month sleep regression but now we are mostly where we were before that started —except that, before, he didn’t need a dream feed to make it to this MOTN bottle.

I always wait a few minutes before I feed him when he wakes. A lot of nights he has one waking where he puts himself back to sleep and I don’t feed him. 

The situation is by no means dire but I parent solo most of the time (DH travels), I’m very tired and I would really like to wean his night bottles and get him sleeping through the night.

We followed Ferber a few weeks ago and our 21 week old daughter sleeps through the night, but tends to wake super early.

Her routine looks roughly like this:
Wake anywhere between 04:45-06:00 (most of the time between 04:45-05:15, sometimes she nods back off but this is rare, we don’t go into her before 06:00 regardless of what time she wakes, as this is the earliest we would like her to get up)

Bottle at 18:30
Bedtime routine starts 18:15-18:30
Asleep by 18:45-19:15

These times are approximate, but she’s averaging 10hr40 overnight sleep and 3hr20 daytime naps in total according to the app I use to track.

She goes down awake, rarely cries and has usually nodded off within 10 mins. She’s then sleeping through, just waking really early.

She fights most of her daytime naps even though she’s quite obviously tired (yawning, eye rubbing, grumpy!).

I also appreciate she should be dropping down to 3 naps a day now, but I’m really struggling to stretch her awake times any further and also squeeze her 5 bottles in (I’ve tried dropping her onto 4 larger bottles but she won’t drink anymore out of each individual bottle so just ends up 6oz short that day). I’m not sure if that’s relevant.

Bedtime routine starts 18:15-18:30
Asleep by 18:45-19:15

These times are approximate, but she’s averaging 10hr40 overnight sleep and 3hr20 daytime naps in total according to the app I use to track.

She goes down awake, rarely cries and has usually nodded off within 10 mins. She’s then sleeping through, just waking really early.

She fights most of her daytime naps even though she’s quite obviously tired (yawning, eye rubbing, grumpy!).

I also appreciate she should be dropping down to 3 naps a day now, but I’m really struggling to stretch her awake times any further and also squeeze her 5 bottles in (I’ve tried dropping her onto 4 larger bottles but she won’t drink anymore out of each individual bottle so just ends up 6oz short that day). I’m not sure if that’s relevant.

Our ideal wake up time for her is between 06:00-07:00.

All suggestions and tips are welcome!"
17 month old bedtime struggles,sleeptrain,1,ddgrxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/ddgrxk/17_month_old_bedtime_struggles/,1,1570267847.0,"The good: My 17 month old sleeps in a crib in his own room.  I finally fully night weaned him several months ago. I nurse him in the evenings on demand and in the morning after breakfast (it takes a lot to distract him that long). I nurse him at bedtime after bath and pjs but before stories and songs. He naps perfectly at daycare for 2 hrs (1-3) and puts himself down there.

The bad: Our son has a natural bedtime of 8:30. Since I dropped the final night feed (early morning) his waking have gotten really early. 5am to 6 most commonly, sometimes 6:30 and sometimes before 5. If before 5 we mostly get him back down. If after 5 it’s 50-50. After 6 I have no complaints. I don’t think his getting enough sleep overall. When he’s up before 5:30 he often falls asleep for 20 mins on the drive into daycare at 8.

The super frustrating: Getting him down has gotten so hard lately. It’s like he’s listening to us waiting to hear if we’re going to try to leave the room. We used to be able to lay him down pretty drowsy and maybe rub his tummy for a second, but now he listens like a hawk and stands up just when we think he’s down. Bedtime is taking an hour after the last step of our routine. I’m sick of it and now he’s getting even LESS sleep. Please help.

I decided to sleep train my daughter at 4.5 months because bedtime and naps had become such a huge ordeal.  It would take over an hour to get her down for bed. I'd rock her, set her down asleep, she'd wake up - rinse and repeat.  ""Drowsy but awake"" was not something I could ever achieve.  I spontaneously decided on Ferber one night after I just *couldn't* get her down. I decided to let her fuss and do the checkins.

She usually sleeps through the night or at least until 5ish. When she wakes, I feed her and put her right back down. She falls back asleep quickly.

Naps took a little longer to improve.  I kept trying to put her down awake and let her self soothe and it worked about half the time.  Eventually she started falling asleep independently for all her naps.  I was hoping that this would solve the issue of her crap naps (4-5 30-40 minute naps a day) but it didn't.  At about 5.5 months I started letting her fuss for 10 minutes upon waking. After weeks of this she started falling back asleep.  Then she just stopped waking at the 30 minute mark. Now when she's at home she can nap 1.5-2 hours 2x a day, with an occasional 3rd nap thrown in. 

It has been a HUGE improvement for all of us - she is happier now that she's getting the proper amount of sleep and we are really happy not to be spending hours a day on getting her to sleep.","Sleep training successI just wanted to post this here because I'm excited and sometimes you only see the hard stories about sleep training!

After a few rocky nights, she goes down within about 10 minutes of minimal fussing, which is great. We night-weaned cold turkey as she slept the first couple nights through for 11 hours (yay!) and thought we were in the clear.

BUT, on night 4, and again last night, she woke up around 4:30 and couldn't get back to sleep. The first time, my husband was adamant that we not go in because we were practicing full extinction. I eventually checked on her after an hour but she didn't go to sleep until we got her at 6 am (our ""morning"") and fed her, and then she passed out for another couple hours. 

Last night when she woke up I did checks every 10 minutes, but she still didn't fall back asleep until I eventually fed her at 5:30, then she slept in until 7:00. I feel like that was not great bc it just taught her that after an hour of crying, she gets fed. :/ Also it was super inconsistent with what we had been doing.

My questions is: should I just re-introduce a ""snooze button"" feeding at 4:00 or so? Feed her right away when she wakes up around then? She sleeps through most nights so far, so I don't want to do it if I don't have to, and create a night waking when there wasn't one.

Help! 2.5 month old won't sleep unless co-sleeping AND nursing,sleeptrain,16,dcd12e,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/dcd12e/help_25_month_old_wont_sleep_unless_cosleeping/,19,1570064376.0,"TLDR: 11 week old takes HOURS to fall asleep in crib, addicted to sucking to sleep. Need tips!!

\----------------------------------------

I have a 2.5 month old and I know that's too young for formal sleep training, but I was still hoping to teach her good habits/to mostly fall asleep on her own (at least to agree to go into her crib drowsy).

**Weeks 0-6:** she slept in her crib fine all through the nights. Obviously multiple wakings (probably 4 ish per night). Fed her about every 2-3 hours, whenever she woke up, and she fell asleep and agreed to sleep in her crib. 

**Weeks 6-9:** we were on a trip, she didn't want to sleep in her travel crib and we ended up letting her co-sleep. Which meant she had my breast to eat from whenever she wanted, pretty much. We also introduced a pacifier, which makes her immediately tired/comforted.

**Weeks 9-11 (now):** We returned from the trip and immediately established that she's back to her crib. But she still pretty much feeds to sleep. Had to ditch the pacifier for nighttime because, while she DESPERATELY wants it, she wakes up and demands it back every time she pops it out (so like ten times in a night, no joke). Paci still goes in for daytime naps, which, except for morning nap, occur while she is held (her insistence). 

Now, it has been two weeks since the return from the trip, and we have been trying to establish good sleep habits but she REFUSES to go down in her crib. We have a bedtime routine, we put her in bed around 7:30 PM (the first attempt), we are trying to make eating NOT the last thing she does (rather, a lullaby/rocking) before setting her down drowsy. Basically, we're doing the Pick Up Put Down method but **EVERY NIGHT for TWO WEEKS we're talking an hour to two hours to get her to sleep in her crib**. That often includes the night wakings- the other night, we did PU/PD for 2 hours only to have her sleep 1.75 hours. 

Note: she barely eats during the day but CHUGS milk at night, basically since birth. I know this is a problem but I don't want to force her to eat.

Please, any suggestions welcome.","Help! 2.5 month old won't sleep unless co-sleeping AND nursingTLDR: 11 week old takes HOURS to fall asleep in crib, addicted to sucking to sleep. Need tips!!

\----------------------------------------

I have a 2.5 month old and I know that's too young for formal sleep training, but I was still hoping to teach her good habits/to mostly fall asleep on her own (at least to agree to go into her crib drowsy).

**Weeks 0-6:** she slept in her crib fine all through the nights. Obviously multiple wakings (probably 4 ish per night). Fed her about every 2-3 hours, whenever she woke up, and she fell asleep and agreed to sleep in her crib. 

**Weeks 6-9:** we were on a trip, she didn't want to sleep in her travel crib and we ended up letting her co-sleep. Which meant she had my breast to eat from whenever she wanted, pretty much. We also introduced a pacifier, which makes her immediately tired/comforted.

**Weeks 9-11 (now):** We returned from the trip and immediately established that she's back to her crib. But she still pretty much feeds to sleep. Had to ditch the pacifier for nighttime because, while she DESPERATELY wants it, she wakes up and demands it back every time she pops it out (so like ten times in a night, no joke). Paci still goes in for daytime naps, which, except for morning nap, occur while she is held (her insistence). 

Now, it has been two weeks since the return from the trip, and we have been trying to establish good sleep habits but she REFUSES to go down in her crib. We have a bedtime routine, we put her in bed around 7:30 PM (the first attempt), we are trying to make eating NOT the last thing she does (rather, a lullaby/rocking) before setting her down drowsy. Basically, we're doing the Pick Up Put Down method but **EVERY NIGHT for TWO WEEKS we're talking an hour to two hours to get her to sleep in her crib**. That often includes the night wakings- the other night, we did PU/PD for 2 hours only to have her sleep 1.75 hours. 

Note: she barely eats during the day but CHUGS milk at night, basically since birth. I know this is a problem but I don't want to force her to eat.

Sometimes it's at 1am, sometimes 3am, sometimes 4am, then he'll randomly sleep through without waking, there's no rhyme or reason as to what time he wakes up or if he wakes up. And he's definitely hungry, he downs an entire 5oz bottle and nothing else will put him back to sleep. I tried doing dream feeds and it worked great for a couple nights, but my husband tried it and it totally failed, he woke up completely and took forever to get back to sleep. So now my husband is against dream feeding. He doesn't need to eat at night, according to our pediatrician (at 28lbs he is the 100th percentile lol). We tried reducing the amount in the bottle each night, but when we got to 3oz he screamed and wouldn't go back to bed so I ended up just giving him 2 more ounces to get him to sleep. Is there anything we can do to stop these night feedings? Or are we just stuck feeding him once a night until he drops it on his own?"

My LO is 4.5 months and currently co-sleeps.  Definitely not what was initially planned but it is what it is. 
We tried to sleep train via CIO a couple of days ago but my LO ends up needing to burp from all the crying. He’s not yet sitting independently and so can’t burp himself so we have to pick him up to do that. And when we do, he falls asleep in our arms so we put him back down and the crying starts again. This went on for 2 hours without him actually falling asleep in the crib. 
Any suggestions? How can we sleep train a baby that needs help to burp so much from crying?","Sleep training a gassy babyHello everyone

11mo old losing it for naps & bedtime + middle of the night wakings... is this separation anxiety??,sleeptrain,11,db191m,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/db191m/11mo_old_losing_it_for_naps_bedtime_middle_of_the/,14,1569820016.0,"Our 11mo was ST at 8mo using Ferber/CIO. It was a rocky road but she got it down in the end. We struggled with early wakings for awhile which seemed to be (mostly) resolved by darkening the room and shifting her first nap. Occasionally, I was still helping her to get her proper amount of nap time by letting her have the second half of her second nap on me if need me. I know that’s probably not recommended, but I’d rather that than her being overtired or a crazy early bedtime. 

My husband went away for 4 nights (we usually do bedtime routine together) and on the last night she lost it as soon as she left my arms. I would come in a comfort her and she would scream hysterically as soon as I would leave. Then naps have started to go down the tubes... she will be ok until I lay her down or leave the room and then it is pure insanity. It doesn’t feel like the kind of cry I am willing to let go on for too long, as it is absolutely hysterical. Almost worse than when we first tried to sleep train.

Could this be separation anxiety? Any recommendations on how to handle it? She already has 8 teeth and we think she might be getting more, possibly her molars as we can see white back there and so much drool. But it seems like if it were teething related, she wouldn’t be soothed when I picked her up? Right now, she will calm down almost immediately upon me picking her up. Last night she woke up 5 times over night and needed to be comforted. This is a complete anomaly. She almost never wakes up to the point she needs us to intervene. 

I feel so lost. I don’t want to “undo” our sleep training efforts, but I also don’t think I can just let her scream/cry like she is. Help!

She's doing pretty well at night, no more nursing, maybe one or two wakeups most of the time that are usually just me putting her binky back in or extricating her little foot from the crib slats. She even goes to sleep easily when my husband or MIL put her down! Hooray!

But for a few weeks now, she's been taking terrible naps. Short morning naps where I have to nurse her halfway through to get a decent amount of sleep into her. Crazy short afternoon naps that are shrinking down to 25 minutes (\*tears out hair\*). She was a good napper for a long time, napping nice and long in my arms until she was 7 months old, then transitioning with almost no issues to her crib (we'll skip over the 3 weeks in August when we went to the other side of the country for 3 weeks and she got sick 72 hours after arriving. Not good times. But her naps were actually ok usually, and we got back on track!). She's getting about 13 hours a day, according to Huckleberry, and I'm not the greatest about a strict schedule, but that never seemed like a problem.

I don't know what's going on. Should I make her morning nap earlier? It's been creeping up to 10:30, 10:40, or even later, but a) she's almost a year old so I figured she could handle 3+ hours awake, and b) she often wakes up around 6 but we don't get up until 7, so I nurse her and put her back to bed and she sleeps til 7 or sometimes later. I admit this is a bad habit (I \*definitely\* need to go to bed earlier) and it might be what's ruining her morning nap, but I don't know why the afternoon nap would be affected. Bedtime is between 7:30 and 8, and it's hard to push it earlier at the moment because her big brother (4.75yo) goes to bed around 8, and it's hard to keep him quiet for longer than half an hour or so, although he does try hard.

Or is it time to drop to one nap? It seems pretty early. She's crawling like a champ and trying to stand up, and she's got a few teeth but none coming right this minute, I don't think. She eats like a horse, and nursing does seem to help in the morning (not a good habit, though), but it doesn't do anything for the afternoon naps.

First off, when I decided to sleep train, my daughter was dependent on nursing to sleep and she slept in our bed. Before we started sleep training, we transitioned our daughter to the crib in her room. I wanted her to get used to the environment and be comfortable with it. So for a while, I nursed and rocked her to sleep in her room and placed her in her crib when she was asleep. This was hard because she would wake up easily when I would transition her into her crib, especially for naps, but we stuck it out for two weeks before we began sleep training. 

We began sleep training when my daughter was seven months old. Something I do not recommend, because at this age, she was able to pull herself up on the crib and was not able to get herself down. So, I would recommend starting earlier, maybe before baby can pull themselves up? Or later, when baby knows how to get themselves down. But either way, this didn't turn out to be a big issue. 

The basic premise of The Happy Sleeper method is called the Sleep Wave, in which you conduct five minute check-ins with baby (only when they are actively crying. Not fussing or whining, but crying) and you recite a pre-planned phrase like, ""It's time for sleep, mommy and daddy are just down the hall."" ...or something to that effect. The concept is that the baby cries because she's upset about not being rocked to sleep, but never gets to the point of crying because she's scared and worried she's been left alone. And eventually, baby realizes mommy and daddy have not left her alone and she falls asleep. 

What I liked most about The Happy Sleeper is the emphasis they put on the sleep environment and a bedtime routine. I think these are the components that made us successful. The book is \*filled\* with a lot of good information about sleep environment and bedtime routine. So, prior to beginning sleep training, we implemented a strict bedtime routine. That way, baby was cued in on what was ahead: Sleep. We use the same routine for nap times, minus bath/lotion/PJs. \*I cannot emphasize enough how important a consistent bedtime routine is.\* 

So for two weeks, while baby was getting used to the crib, we implemented the bedtime routine. Then we started the dreaded sleep training that I had been putting off for months! It. was. HARD. (on me). 

The first night was the most stressful night of my life! She cried for about 30-40 minutes. I actually put her to bed later than usual, so she would be extra tired (in hopes she put up less of a fight). I think that helped. We did five minute checks and she grew angrier at each one. She pulled herself up on the side of the crib and didn't know how to get back down. The book instructed us to help baby get back down, but show her mechanically how to get down, so she would quickly learn to do it on her own. So that's what we did, even though it pissed her off even more because she thought we were going to pick her up and we never did. 

The second night she did much better. She only cried for 15-20 min. The second night, I decided to leave her alone when she pulled herself up because she would need to learn to get down on her own anyway. I watched her on the video monitor to make sure she was safe, (it was so sad because she would fall asleep standing up), but eventually she did learn to fall on her butt and lay down. So, I don't regret not helping her get down lol. 

By the third night, I completely abandoned the five minute checks and just let her cry it out. I didn't like the five minute checks because it seemed to make her more upset, and it really seemed to drag things out. I felt like there were times she was probably 90 seconds away from falling asleep, but my five minute check ruined it and made her upset all over again. Now, I am so pleased I switched to letting her cry it out, because it was so much easier on both me and the baby. She fell asleep much faster and I was less stressed because of that. 

I wasn't worried about her having attachment problems because she's truly not being neglected or abandoned. (Children with trauma from being neglected, were severely neglected for hours and hours. Not for minutes while taking a nap or going down for the night. And those poor neglected babies are the ones that are left alone, not fed, not hugged, not loved, not picked up, not snuggled! It's completely different!) She knows she's loved, cared for, and that her needs are consistently met. And through time and consistency, she now knows confidently that as soon as she wakes up, I'm right there to get her. Even when she wakes up in the middle of the night, I go in to make sure she knows I'm there and then back out of the room I go. 

She was still doing night feedings when we sleep trained, so I would still go in and feed her. Most of the time, she'd be dream sleeping and transition back into the crib easily, but on the occasions she would wake up after a feeding, I'd let her cry it out and she'd go back to sleep almost instantly.

Now, she's eleven months old and she goes down to sleep like a dream. Most of the time, she still gets mad and fusses when I put her int he crib, but she quickly gets herself comfortable and falls asleep, because she knows its bedtime, and she knows I'm not going to pick her up until she has slept. 

Something else I liked about The Happy Sleeper is the inspiration and validation that they provide in the book. It assures you that you're making the right decision. It compares baby learning to put herself to sleep to baby learning how to walk. It describes rocking baby to sleep like picking up your child and carrying them when they're learning to walk. Everyone eventually learns to soothe themselves to sleep. It talks about how everyone wakes up at night, even adults, but adults know how to fall back asleep. So we have to train babies to do the same. And given the opportunity, they are 100% capable of putting themselves to sleep. 

I'm sorry this post is SO long, but I wanted to be detailed and thorough. I wanted to be a good resource for others. 

Sleep training is the best decision I've ever made! We have our bed back, we have our room back, we don't spend 10, 15, 20, 30 minutes trying to rock baby to sleep every night and twice a day for naps. We don't have to hold her while she naps. It is very liberating, and we are all better for it! Even baby!! She sleeps SO much better now. We all wake up rested and ready for a fun and productive day!","The best decision I've ever made: How I successfully sleep trained using The Happy Sleeper.I wanted to share my story to help other parents with sleep training.

Sleep training vs night weaning?,sleeptrain,1,dawh9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/dawh9w/sleep_training_vs_night_weaning/,5,1569799164.0,"I'm looking for primarily clarification: I've heard sleep training and night weaning are 2 different things, and I think he is conflating night weans with sleep training. Would love to better understand the difference. And any resources on night weaning to understand options when she is ready.

My daughter is 3 months, and is/has been an overall great sleeper, so right now I have no interest in sleep training. 

She is typically up 2x to nurse during the night (down around 730-9pm, falls asleep nursing. Then up for a nurse around 1/2am and again around 430am.  She is usually up for the day around 730am). She goes back down on her own so well at night, I just feed, diaper and put her in the bassinet and she's out (no swaddle since 2 weeks)

My husband is more interested in sleep training when she is 4-5 months, in particular looking to eliminate at least one if not both of her night feeds.

Since she has basically done this routine of going down easily (knock on wood) since she was born, I think we don't need to sleep train (unless things change).

And she definitely wants /needs to eat when she wakes up, so is not ready to night wean or to drop 1 feed.","Sleep training vs night weaning?I'm looking for primarily clarification: I've heard sleep training and night weaning are 2 different things, and I think he is conflating night weans with sleep training.

3.5 year old sleep troubles,sleeptrain,2,das3wh,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/das3wh/35_year_old_sleep_troubles/,8,1569771063.0,"It’s 224 am and I’m posting this out of desperation. Ok so my 3.5 year old was born an awful sleeper. Around a year old we did total extinction and it took about 2 weeks of hours of screaming, vomiting, the whole 9 yards to get her to sleep through the night. She did that for about a year until baby brother came along (1 now). He sleeps through the night, but big sister wakes up 2-5 times every night. She will get up and SCREAM MAAAMAAAAAAAA at her door (which we have to keep locked because she will go downstairs and unlock the front door/sliding door... just from experience) so she will scream and kick the door which is extremely loud and will wake up little brother, who is otherwise sleeping soundly through the night. My question is about what to do with this behavior. It has been going on for many months. When I respond and go into her room to stop the screaming and kicking the door, it takes 10-15 minutes of her crying saying she wants to snuggle, wants To come in our room, wants this or that, etc to get her back into bed. Once I leave it’s just a matter of time before it happens again. Usually 2-5 times a night. Up at the crack of dawn doing it again.

If I ignore the behavior, the screaming escalates, she will vomit on the floor, and usually wakes up her brother because they share a wall between their rooms. 

I’m so exhausted. I’m not sure what to do. I thought total extinction would be a good option because it worked when she was “trapped” in her crib and had nowhere to go and nothing to do but sleep, but since she can get up and bang on the door and scream sad things like DONT LOCK ME IN HERE, I MISS YOU... etc . I just need help.....","3.5 year old sleep troublesIt’s 224 am and I’m posting this out of desperation. Ok so my 3.5 year old was born an awful sleeper.

Ferber problem—advice needed!!,sleeptrain,1,daspox,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/daspox/ferber_problemadvice_needed/,1,1569775903.0,"Hey! So we did Ferber with my almost 7 month old about a month ago and it went great! He usually goes to sleep on his own with no crying or like under 5 mins tops. 

I kept a night feed, which would happen between 430-5. I did this for two reasons: I like nursing him at that time because he’s very calm and I don’t get to much in the day when I’m at work AND because it helps him sleep in till 7 or 730 which I LOVE.

WELL two nights ago he woke for the night feed at 330. I let him cry because it wasn’t time yet, but he cried for 20 mins, my husband went in to calm him but he was completely inconsolable, and then he cried for another 20 and it was close enough to 430 that I just fed him. Now today we’re staying with a friend and he woke up at 330 again, and I just nursed to avoid crying and waking the friend’s baby. 

The problem with this is that when he wakes at 330 he doesn’t sleep in :( I can pretty much count on him waking 2.5 hours from whenever I start the feeding, so tomorrow it will be 6. 

Any tips on how I can push it back an hour without him crying each night for an hour?? Has this night feeding run its course and I should just try and drop it? If I’m gonna have to get used to waking up at 6, id rather not also get up at 330!!","Ferber problem—advice needed!!Hey!

CIO Sleep Training- The BEST sleep I have had since being PREGNANT- My first week of sleep training with cry times,sleeptrain,62,da9drf,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/da9drf/cio_sleep_training_the_best_sleep_i_have_had/,17,1569661492.0,"I wanted to start this off first by warning that this will be a long post.
Prior to seriously starting our sleep training I read a lot of the posts on this sub and I really liked reading the posts that included people’s experiences with their cry times. I thought if I really appreciated these posts, there must be other people in the same boat as me that would also appreciate it. So here it is. My experience. Our first 8 nights sleep training with the CIO Extinction Method. 

Our LO has always been a great sleeper. When we came home from the hospital he had a few iffy weeks where we wondered if he was colic but once asleep, he would sleep 6hrs in a row... a newborn. I spent a lot of time on google searching “Should newborns be sleeping 6 hours in a row”, “newborn sleeping too much at night?”. You name it, I googled it. Fast forward, our little guy turned 4 months and I kept reading about the dreaded 4 month sleep regression, still he slept like a dream, waking only 2 time, 3 times max a night and going to sleep very easily. I thought maybe it won’t happen to us, not all babies go through it, right? Well..... when he turned 5 months old (or somewhere around that time), our 2-3 wake ups turned into 4-5, sometimes 6. It would sometime take him 1+ hrs to get him back in his crib- I had to make sure he was COMPLETELY asleep before even trying to put him in his crib, and if I was a minute too quick, well then the whole process started over again. 

Just before he turned 5 months, my husband and I purchased the Little Ones Sleep Program and read through all of their materials with the plan to start it when he turned 5 months old. We quickly implemented their schedule and followed it pretty religiously. We are still very lucky when it comes to his daytime naps, our little guy still sleeps like a rock during the day and goes down very easily for naps. Following the daytime nap schedule that the Little Ones program suggests was very easy for us. Our little guy followed the nap schedule for about a week before we decided it was time to try and start to teach him to self sooth. The first night we tried one the suggested self-soothing techniques was a nightmare. Our LO cried buddy milder for 30 min straight. This program involves a lot of hands on self-soothing which suggests staying in the room for some of the techniques. When we called it quits, our LO cried HARD for a good 30 min afterwards- it felt like he was never going to calm down. After that nightmare/first experience sleep training, we thought we would look into no-cry/gentle methods.... and then it started, our dream sleeper turned into an awful sleeper, and I turned into a basket case. I couldn’t do it anymore, all of the wake ups, the long nights, the little sleep. Even though, he was sleeping like garbage at night, we were still very religiously following the daytime nap schedule and worked very hard at doing a bedtime routine/nap time routine. 

After three weeks of hell, lots of research online, reading the posts from r/sleeptrain and finishing the book Precious Little Sleep, we decided we were going to do the CIO Extinction Method. We knew however that we were still going to most likely have to wake up 2x a night to nurse but we also knew that the Ferber method would not work for him following our last try at sleep training. The plan was to start on a Friday to allow 2 nights where my husband would not have to go into work the following morning after what we knew would probably be a sleepless night. 

The week my son turned 6 months old, we went to get his 6 month shots the day before his half birthday(Friday). By this point, I was exhausted, grouchy, and depressed, his sleep or lack of was really affecting me. I knew I didn’t want to start his sleep training on the day he got his shots because I wasn’t sure how he would react to them. This meant I would have to wait one more week before starting the training. I couldn’t do it. My husband couldn’t do it. We started the sleep training that night, the same day he got his 6mo shots. Following our last experience I was sure it was going to be a nightmare- I thought he would cry for hours. I was so surprised.

Here is a summary of our first 8 nights sleep training including cry/awake times* (I will use awake times rather than cry times because on occasions, he would be awake and not crying)

Night #8 (Tonight)
7:07-7:14PM: 7min

All of the wake ups this last 8 days in the middle of the night has been to nurse, this usually only take 15-20 min. I am so shocked that he went from waking 2-3 times (when he was doing good) 4-6 times (when things were bad) to only once at night. These last 7 nights have been the best sleep I have had since being pregnant. I never thought I would say this... While SLEEP TRAINING my son, I have had the BEST sleep. WHAT? That’s crazy. 

If you made it to the end of this post, thanks for reading, My hope is that by writing this, I’ve helped at least one person feel more at ease about starting their sleep training journey. I know ours is far from being over but this first week has been great and I’m focussing on that.","CIO Sleep Training- The BEST sleep I have had since being PREGNANT- My first week of sleep training with cry timesI wanted to start this off first by warning that this will be a long post.

It would sometime take him 1+ hrs to get him back in his crib- I had to make sure he was COMPLETELY asleep before even trying to put him in his crib, and if I was a minute too quick, well then the whole process started over again. 

Just before he turned 5 months, my husband and I purchased the Little Ones Sleep Program and read through all of their materials with the plan to start it when he turned 5 months old. We quickly implemented their schedule and followed it pretty religiously. We are still very lucky when it comes to his daytime naps, our little guy still sleeps like a rock during the day and goes down very easily for naps. Following the daytime nap schedule that the Little Ones program suggests was very easy for us. Our little guy followed the nap schedule for about a week before we decided it was time to try and start to teach him to self sooth. The first night we tried one the suggested self-soothing techniques was a nightmare. Our LO cried buddy milder for 30 min straight. This program involves a lot of hands on self-soothing which suggests staying in the room for some of the techniques. When we called it quits, our LO cried HARD for a good 30 min afterwards- it felt like he was never going to calm down. After that nightmare/first experience sleep training, we thought we would look into no-cry/gentle methods.... and then it started, our dream sleeper turned into an awful sleeper, and I turned into a basket case. I couldn’t do it anymore, all of the wake ups, the long nights, the little sleep. Even though, he was sleeping like garbage at night, we were still very religiously following the daytime nap schedule and worked very hard at doing a bedtime routine/nap time routine. 

After three weeks of hell, lots of research online, reading the posts from r/sleeptrain and finishing the book Precious Little Sleep, we decided we were going to do the CIO Extinction Method. We knew however that we were still going to most likely have to wake up 2x a night to nurse but we also knew that the Ferber method would not work for him following our last try at sleep training. The plan was to start on a Friday to allow 2 nights where my husband would not have to go into work the following morning after what we knew would probably be a sleepless night. 

The week my son turned 6 months old, we went to get his 6 month shots the day before his half birthday(Friday). By this point, I was exhausted, grouchy, and depressed, his sleep or lack of was really affecting me. I knew I didn’t want to start his sleep training on the day he got his shots because I wasn’t sure how he would react to them. This meant I would have to wait one more week before starting the training. I couldn’t do it. My husband couldn’t do it. We started the sleep training that night, the same day he got his 6mo shots. Following our last experience I was sure it was going to be a nightmare- I thought he would cry for hours. I was so surprised.

Here is a summary of our first 8 nights sleep training including cry/awake times* (I will use awake times rather than cry times because on occasions, he would be awake and not crying)

3:34- 3:36AM: 2min
Awake approx 6AM
Total: 36min

Night #8 (Tonight)
7:07-7:14PM: 7min

All of the wake ups this last 8 days in the middle of the night has been to nurse, this usually only take 15-20 min. I am so shocked that he went from waking 2-3 times (when he was doing good) 4-6 times (when things were bad) to only once at night. These last 7 nights have been the best sleep I have had since being pregnant. I never thought I would say this... While SLEEP TRAINING my son, I have had the BEST sleep. WHAT? That’s crazy. 

If you made it to the end of this post, thanks for reading, My hope is that by writing this, I’ve helped at least one person feel more at ease about starting their sleep training journey. I know ours is far from being over but this first week has been great and I’m focussing on that."

2 year sleep regression,sleeptrain,1,da4eey,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/da4eey/2_year_sleep_regression/,0,1569637422.0,"Hi reddit, we could really use your advice with our 2 yr old — tl;dr, right after his most recent birthday his sleep habits went totally bonkers.

For context, he co-slept with us until he was about a year old. After that, we spent a few months trying to gradually transition him to his crib, but didn’t have much luck until we decided to try CIO. It worked amazingly, in two days he was sleeping through the night and from then on, with a few exceptions due to illness and travel, he was an incredible sleeper. he would go down right away and sleep soundly for 12 hours every night. 

Right around his birthday last month, he started to fight going to sleep. For the past few weeks getting him into bed has been an hours-long process. He often wakes up in the night and sometimes doesn’t go back to sleep until like 5 am. 

i gather a two year sleep regression is developmentally normal. As well, there have been some changes in his life recently — several of his very close daycare friends started school or changed programs — and there will be more soon as we are moving next month. So we did expect a bit of disruption, and thankfully he is mostly retaining his normal cheerful nature during the long nights. but we need our sleep back!

Life After Sleep Training,sleeptrain,1,da46oy,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/da46oy/life_after_sleep_training/,4,1569636459.0,"I'm a week in to sleep training my 8-month-old and seeing big improvements already using the Ferber method. Prior to this I'd been bouncing him to sleep, putting him down in his crib, then tiptoeing out. That worked until it didn't, and around 7 months old he started waking in the night, crying for me to come back and pat his back until he fell back asleep. That quickly escalated to him waking 12x/night so here we are! After a couple false starts that ended in him getting sick we're back on track.

It's still early, but at this point results vary for us - some nights there's a light fuss for 30 seconds, other nights there's big crying for 10 minutes. Once sleep training is ""complete"" (I know we'll likely repeat this down the road as needed), I'm wondering what that means.

So for those who've made it to the other side, what does bedtime look like after sleep training?

I'm assuming there's a bedtime routine, put them in the crib, say goodnight and leave .... and then what? Are they happily chatting? Resting quietly? Fussing/crying some nights?

For those who have used a similar method at a similar age, if they go back to crying hard at bedtime, do you start back up again with the beginning/smallest intervals for checks?

After training, if they do wake up in the night do you assume something is off and go in right away? Or do you wait a few minutes before checking?

I have some residual anxiety now around bedtime and sleep in general because I'm always on edge, waiting for a long cry. Does that pass or lessen down the road, or is that just part of parenthood?

Change of Cot Location,sleeptrain,2,d9uobw,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/d9uobw/change_of_cot_location/,4,1569583592.0,"Hi all,

Seeking some advice before sleep training day 3 (or even resetting to day 1...) commences tonight for my 9 month old. Previously, he was waking up every 1.5h to 2h to nurse (eyes closed, most probably just needed me to fall back asleep).

For the 1st night, we started at 8pm, tried Ferber's method of checking-in at 3rd, 5th,7th, 10th minute ...this went on for an hour before I waved the white flag. 9pm, took baby out of cot, nursed him and he immediately fell asleep. He slept till 3am, nursed and he fell asleep. Again at 5am, latched him and he fell asleep till he got up at 7am and we left for day care. His cot is beside our bed in our room. I thought this was an improvement considering he used to sleep with us on the bed and he could actually sleep in the cot now.

Day 2- started at 7.45pm, tried Ferber's method of checking-in at 5th,7th,10th,15th minute...and then I dragged till 30th minute because each check-in was making him more agitated. Things took a turn for the worse cause he managed to heave himself out of the cot and onto our bed. 9.30pm-We lowered his cot to the lowest level, changed him out of his sweaty PJs, calmed and fed him, restarted extinction at 10.30pm. He fell asleep about 15 minutes later. Fast forward to 4am, he woke up crying but we pretended to be asleep. 4.20am, we thought he was asleep so we peered at him. He was not! Started crying, both of us had to leave the room and he fell asleep maybe 10 minutes later. 5.30am he started crying again and I nursed him because it was almost time to wake up and prep for day care.

Due to many mistakes on Day 1 and 2, I think Day 3 might be considered as a restart.

I am leaning towards extinction as he gets very agitated with each check-in. I would like to move him to another room but would that be too extreme? His voice is very hoarse but I am determined not to give up. I have no control over his day naps as he is in day care. He has recently transited to 2 naps per day (1h+ for one nap and 45 mins for the other).

Please let us know your opinions if extinction + new room would be encouraged for Day 3. Thank you.","Change of Cot LocationHi all,

Seeking some advice before sleep training day 3 (or even resetting to day 1...) commences tonight for my 9 month old. Previously, he was waking up every 1.5h to 2h to nurse (eyes closed, most probably just needed me to fall back asleep).

For the 1st night, we started at 8pm, tried Ferber's method of checking-in at 3rd, 5th,7th, 10th minute ...this went on for an hour before I waved the white flag. 9pm, took baby out of cot, nursed him and he immediately fell asleep. He slept till 3am, nursed and he fell asleep. Again at 5am, latched him and he fell asleep till he got up at 7am and we left for day care. His cot is beside our bed in our room. I thought this was an improvement considering he used to sleep with us on the bed and he could actually sleep in the cot now.

Day 2- started at 7.45pm, tried Ferber's method of checking-in at 5th,7th,10th,15th minute...and then I dragged till 30th minute because each check-in was making him more agitated. Things took a turn for the worse cause he managed to heave himself out of the cot and onto our bed. 9.30pm-We lowered his cot to the lowest level, changed him out of his sweaty PJs, calmed and fed him, restarted extinction at 10.30pm. He fell asleep about 15 minutes later. Fast forward to 4am, he woke up crying but we pretended to be asleep. 4.20am, we thought he was asleep so we peered at him. He was not! Started crying, both of us had to leave the room and he fell asleep maybe 10 minutes later. 5.30am he started crying again and I nursed him because it was almost time to wake up and prep for day care.

Due to many mistakes on Day 1 and 2, I think Day 3 might be considered as a restart.

I am leaning towards extinction as he gets very agitated with each check-in. I would like to move him to another room but would that be too extreme? His voice is very hoarse but I am determined not to give up. I have no control over his day naps as he is in day care. He has recently transited to 2 naps per day (1h+ for one nap and 45 mins for the other).

Please let us know your opinions if extinction + new room would be encouraged for Day 3. Thank you."

Son is 9m, we sleep trained him at 5.5m using extinction method. We started with times checks but it quickly became apparent that he was getting more worked up by the checks. He took to it very well, in 2 nights he was sleeping through the night and naps improved loads too. However....At about 6m we took him to visit his grandparents and he started waking between 5-5.30, and he hasn't stopped since. We get up to 6.15 the odd day but it's a rarity, and I notice when we do he is in a great mood that day. I'm shattered. I struggle with sleep anyway, but because I know he'll be up, I end up waking before 5 in anticipation. A few days ago I snapped and have implemented a strict do not enter till 6.30am rule, but so far we haven't even got an extra 5m out of him, just babbles then cries.

Wakes anywhere between 5 - 5.30.
Babbles for about 30m
Cries/shouts for the remaining time till 6.30am.

2 naps a day, first one at 9/9.30 regardless of wake up as I don't want to allow him to continue his night sleep. He used to do 1.5hrs here but I've had to cap at 40m as otherwise he resists the afternoon nap, so waking about 10am.

2pm afternoon nap for as long as he likes, usually 1.5hrs, sometimes up to 2hrs.

Bedtime at 7. 

He isn't fed to sleep anymore, room is blacked out. I'm taking tinfoil, Velcro blackout blind, with blackout curtains over the top lol. White noise playing, double bagged nappy incase of leaks. He's in a sleeping bag so I know he isn't cold. He isn't hungry, but he's the type.of baby who would eat anytime it was offered, but he definitely doesn't need it. He generally wakes up happy but gets progressively more moany and would definitely like an earlier nap if id let him. I've tried earlier bedtime, it eventually moves wake up earlier, but then when I tried a later bedtime wake time didn't move so he just ended up getting less sleep and was a mess. We've tried feeding, then putting back in cot but it doesn't change anything, and I didn't want to introduce an expectation of a 5am feed where there hadn't been one before. I feel like I've really tried everything. I just don't want to accept that this might just be it.

Has anyone had success with just leaving them till desired wake up? Surely if he was going to go back down he'd sleep for even 5m, but he doesn't at all.

First, naps went to poo with him screaming and having a fit 50% of the time then passing out on me when I take him out of his crib. Unfortunate, but he started school 3 mornings/week recently.

I can't stress enough how out of control upset he gets. I tried going in to calm him down and getting him to fall back asleep in his crib but he wore me down, and I'm not a stranger to hearing this kid complain in his crib. For his nap today, he freaked out for 20 minutes in his crib until I couldn't stand it anymore and let him sleep on me. He was so upset from that 20 minutes that his breathing hitched from the intense sobbing for 40 minutes. It was heartbreaking.

I know it was a bad move to let him sleep with me, but it just spiraled out of control the last week or so. Has anyone else dealt with a decent sleeper who suddenly had such severe problems?

He was so upset from that 20 minutes that his breathing hitched from the intense sobbing for 40 minutes. It was heartbreaking. 

&#x200B;

I know it was a bad move to let him sleep with me, but it just spiraled out of control the last week or so. Has anyone else dealt with a decent sleeper who suddenly had such severe problems? I can't decide if I need to white knuckle a few days of Ferber or total extinction and nip this in the bud, or if there's something going on with him that I can't figure out and I need to approach the situation more gently. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

&#x200B;

Daily Schedule: Bedtime at 8, up around 6:30, sometimes all night in his crib but generally his last hour of sleep is with me. This doesn't bother me. Nap 12:30 or 1 for an hour and a half."

Did you wean and nap train simultaneously while sleep training?,sleeptrain,1,d97njo,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/d97njo/did_you_wean_and_nap_train_simultaneously_while/,3,1569466059.0,"Husband and I are planning to sleep train our 4 month old this weekend following The Sleepeasy Solution book which incorporates letting baby cry for timed intervals with no-contact check-ins. Our number one goal for sleep training is for baby to fall asleep independently. We currently rock/nurse (EBF)/shush for up to two hours and we're at the end of our rope!

The book suggests weaning and nap training simultaneously for fastest results (family physician okayed night weaning), but I am hesitant for a couple reasons: 1. Our baby seems to be going through a sleep regression so nighttime nursing times are no longer predictable. 2. It seems like so much at once and from lurking this sub I see often times parents work on naps and nights separately. 

TLDR: will be trying The Sleepeasy Solution for sleep training. Has anyone had success with this method by only using it to teach baby to fall asleep independently? Do I need to night wean (Currently EBF) and nap train simultaneously?

Long time observer and first time poster here! This thread gave me the confidence to start sleep training my 4 month old. We did extinction and he went from crying for 45 minutes to now being able to self soothe within 15. 

However, like clock work, he wakes up everyday at 4am and cries non-stop and can go up to an hour. Once we give him the paci, he will stop and sleep, but he’s up again and will continue this until wake up time at 7. It’s been exhausting and I want to so badly not to give him the paci, but he just isn’t able to self soothe.

We give him a MOTN feeding at 11:30, so I don’t think it’s hunger, but it might be? After the 11:30 feeding, he’s getting around 28oz.

Does anyone have any tips or tricks to help this tired mommy out?

I made a breakthrough discovery regarding naps and my almost 6 month old.,sleeptrain,43,d8seg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/d8seg0/i_made_a_breakthrough_discovery_regarding_naps/,5,1569383468.0,"So my almost 6 month old has been sleep trained at night using extinction for about 4 weeks now. She’s been doing great at night and I decided to start nap training a week and a half ago or so. It sucks, I’m doing extinction for naps, and crib hour. So I lay her down in her crib after nap routine and she’s been crying for at least 30 minutes before falling asleep. She only sleeps for about 30-40 minutes for each nap, but we are dealing with that. 

So the past few days what I have discovered is that my naptime routine was wayyy too long. One time I was in a hurry and just kind of took her in her room after eating, bounced her for a minute, turned on noise machine, laid her down WIDE awake and said “I love you, it’s naptime now” turned off the light and walked out. She literally didn’t cry at all she just rolled over, babbled for a second then passed out. So I kept doing it and it has worked wonders! Before I was taking her in her room, changing to pjs/new diaper, read a book/snuggled, bounced, bottle,  then laid her down. It was pretty much the same as her nighttime routine and it was just getting her so much more worked up. 

So maybe give a shorter routine a try if you’re doing an elaborate one without any luck!","I made a breakthrough discovery regarding naps and my almost 6 month old.So my almost 6 month old has been sleep trained at night using extinction for about 4 weeks now.

But now for the last 4 days we haven't managed to have him sleep once using the nap training. We usually try for 40 minutes with 5 minute checks and then wait for 45 minutes to retry and if that doesn't work we go for a walk so he gets some sleep in the pram.

DD has never had bed time issues. Once we discovered what she needed, or needed to do, things went swimmingly well. Nap time was never an issue either except for when she needed to drop a nap and once we did that, about 4/5 months ago, she's been a champ. 

A couple of weeks ago she had a growth spurt, sleep regression, and two teeth all happen within 7 days (not of each other, all at once) and a nasty diaper rash that was one hair from blistering. So sleep was *obliterated*, but DH and I stuck with it as best as we could.

The past 7/10 days she's gotten loads better. Instead of waking up every 1 to 2 hours she was sleeping all the way through the night again with one early ""wake up"" and nothing until 7 AM. But in the last couple of days she's been ""waking up"" twice before midnight and then every 2/3 hours. 

Bed time is between 7/8 (routine starts at 7), a ""wake up"" between 10/11, nothing until 7 most mornings. Maybe a new diaper and a bottle at 4. 
Being up at 7, her first nap has been between 10 and 11 usually with her second nap between 2 and 3. 

Nap time is usually a fight, doesn't matter if it's morning nap or afternoon nap. More often than not she now misses the afternoon nap because nothing works to make her sleep. We've done Ferber, extinction, etc and she just either cries and screams the whole time or talks to herself and then she's grumpy the rest of the afternoon. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. Hubby and I need sleep and I know she needs it too.

Sorry for it being so long. I wanted to get as much info in as possible.","9.5 sleep/nap routine lost and messed upI'm sure this subreddit gets this a lot but holy damn am I at a loss right now.

Sleep/nap training CIO Questions! When is a baby considered sleep trained?,sleeptrain,5,d8w10w,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/d8w10w/sleepnap_training_cio_questions_when_is_a_baby/,1,1569400895.0,"I have a 4 month old who I started sleep training and nap training as of last Thursday using full extinction. So far so good. I’ve decided to keep 2 dream feeds (11 pm and 3 am) as i have got conflicting response from both my family doctor and my paediatrician as to how many hours my BF baby should go. I will revise these dream feeds again in a couple of months.  He is 17 lbs and in the 55th percentile. Debating on whether doing a 7-7 (so full 12 hours without a feed) or 11 pm dream feed. I just don’t want the 4-6 am wake ups, basically I don’t want any earlier wake ups than 7 am. 

Does anyone have any experience at this age with eliminating all night feeds?

My other question is in regards to nap training. Currently using 90 minute wake windows and practicing crib hour as my child doesn’t always make it past an hour nap (on avg 40 minutes). Usually takes 3-4 naps, 4th being a cat nap. Beforehand he wasn’t able to nap unless he was nursed to nap and remained on me, stroller, or car seat. He takes on avg 15 minutes of falling asleep on his own since we have began training. Sometimes he will really cry and other times he will just fuss.  

1) when is a baby considered sleep trained and or/nap trained?

2) would I be able to go for a walk and have him fall asleep in a stroller at this point or is it to soon since he is still being trained... would it make him revert back to his old ways? 

I’m currently house bound since 90 minutes (20-30 of that is breastfeeding and 5 minutes is doing our nap routine and settling him in) doesn’t leave room for me to do anything with him outside of the house and I’m scared to have him fall asleep in the car or in a stroller to ruin all the “training” I have been doing. 

3) I wanted to confirm this: I was told to practice crib hour with specific guidelines as to how long to keep a baby in the crib after they’ve woken from a nap that was less than dependent on wake times. So for 90 minutes, I would leave an additional 15 in the crib as you want the baby out of the crib for at least 1.5 hours until their next nap. Now can I still pick my baby up if they’re  fussing and crying at the additional 15 minute? He usually wakes up quiet and happy but gets antsy and fussy after 15 minutes or so of being left in there. I was told that crib hour is a different training than CIO/sleep training as you’re practicing time rather than CIO. 

Can anyone share their experience if they’ve had a similar one?

Sudden short naps,sleeptrain,2,d8oorb,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/d8oorb/sudden_short_naps/,2,1569367346.0,"Hi, sleeptrain

My 6.5 month old was trained around 4 months (a week shy) with great success. She was mostly a good night sleeper who just couldn't put herself down without a variety of sleep crutches (paci replacement, mostly) and a notorious cat napper. Sleep training gave her the ability to nap up to 2 hours 3 times a day, a \~5 minute self-induced bedtime routine, a semi-reliable night wean, and all with naught but a sleep sack and a kiss goodnight. Glorious. 

In the last week or so, however, her naps have gone completely out of wack. 27 minutes here. 90 minutes there. No predictability, and lots of waking at the 40 minute mark to cry for a few before putting herself back to sleep for another \~20. She used to get at least 3 hours of day sleep, but lately, we're lucky if she gets 2. I know for a fact she needs more--this change has come with a lot of clingy grumpiness, but I'm not sure how to achieve that. She's still taking three naps a day, so I wonder if it's time to drop to two, but she really loses it when we keep her up past 2.5 hours. How does two naps work when your baby can't stay up long enough in between?

For now, we're just instituting a fairly strict crib hour and hoping for the best, but if anyone has any pointers, I'd love to hear them. The whining and loss of baby-free time is really starting to get to me.","Sudden short napsHi, sleeptrain

9 MO regression is hard..

We sleep trained at 6 month using Ferber, worked great, only took 3 days, he normally sleeps 10-11 hours at night.

This regression has been going on sporadically for 2 weeks. Some nights he sleeps, some night he doesn't. Last night he slept a cumulative of about 3 hours, the rest was rock star partying for him and obviously me who is worried he is going to hit his head on his crib.

I am not sure what to do, I can't just let him cry at this point due to possible injuries... We can't put any type of padding in the bed, bumpers... I'm at a loss. His crib mattress is on the lowest possible setting with hopes he won't crawl out and couldn't pull up any longer, but he overcame that obsitcle quickly.

Using a swing to transition to independent sleep,sleeptrain,5,d8d12j,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/d8d12j/using_a_swing_to_transition_to_independent_sleep/,13,1569302046.0,"Hi there, first post in this community so please let me know if I break any rules!

Looking for anyone who has used a swing to share their experience on timelines and relevant tips. 

My daughter is just over 4 months old and we have a pretty solid pattern of nursing to sleep for bedtime, night wakeups and many naps. This isn’t sustainable for me in the long run, and now that her sleep cycles have hit the 4 month shift, it’s getting really hard to get her to stay asleep for the transfer from my lap to her bed (she’s in a cosleeper sidecarred to our king). She’s now waking up a lot at night too (every 45 minutes to 3 hours. We used to get more consistent 3-5 hour stretches). 

She’s really into motion: naps that aren’t kicked off by nursing are always either in the car, the stroller (in car seat) or in a baby carrier. Or, occasionally in the swing. 

I’ve been reading the precious little sleep resources and want to try using the swing as a transitional stage to independent sleep. My main goal is having her fall asleep/back to sleep  without nursing as I feel that pretty much all the other sleep crutches are easier to break, and I really want my husband or other people to be able to put her to bed too. I’m willing to go slow and don’t plan on night weaning anytime soon, though I do hope to get her sleep stretches to lengthen again.

Three days ago we began putting her down in the swing for her naps and her first stretch of night sleep. It has been pretty successful so far: Both myself and my husband have gotten her to fall asleep in the swing (jiggling, white noise, pacifier and shushing required), for two naps pretty much every day since,plus bedtime. Naps are often over an hour and the first nighttime stretch has been 5.5 hours, 5.5 hours, and 3 hours. 

When she wakes from that first stretch, and subsequent stretches, I’m nursing her back to sleep and putting her in the sidecar or our bed, depending on what time it is.

My questions are: anyone who has done this, how long did it take you to move, first to no jiggling, then to a motionless swing, then to drowsy but awake in the crib/ other flat sleep space? Any tips? 

Second, how did/would you deal with night wakings? Is nursing to sleep really the devil here? It keeps her (and me) drowsy, and I am happy to feed her if she’s hungry, I just don’t want to do it every hour, or keep reinforcing that it’s the only way to get to sleep. It seems counterintuitive to wake her up after a middle of the night nursing session... 

Third, would it make more sense to move her from the swing to her bed at nighttime, once she’s asleep? I don’t want her to lose the ability to sleep on a flat firm surface ( which is partly why I don’t put her back in the swing in the middle of the night), but the swing is great for helping her connect sleep cycles.

More relevant info: She’s in a Merlin suit for sleep now but I plan to transition to the zippadee zip or just a sleep sack once she’s falling asleep independently in her own bed.","Using a swing to transition to independent sleepHi there, first post in this community so please let me know if I break any rules!

Usually we do a bath, massage and then my wife breast feeds and rocks baby to sleep.

We are now moving to a bottle before bed for sleep training so basically anyone can put him to sleep.

Should my wife try using the bottle this week before we start sleep training so baby gets used to it by the time we start?  She usually breastfeeds in the dark and we read that using the bottle it should be dim so baby can see us before we leave him to go to bed.

 Or should we just completely change up the schedule once we actually start sleep training and just keep doing what we’re doing now? 

Finally, if you recommend using the bottle this week prior to training, should we feed him the dark like he’s used to now or start doing the dim lighting we will be using for sleep training?

Any input would be greatly appreciated.

He puts himself to sleep for all his naps and bedtime (or did) and usually only wakes once during the night to eat. He started rolling (yay!), so we have to stop using the swaddle (boo!). He wakes up every time he knocks the pacifier out, which is constantly. 

So, what would you do? Ditch the pacifier and try some form of sleep training? Magic Merlin sleep suit? Replace the pacifier 8 million times a night until he’s old enough to do it himself? Send help."
Random regression?,sleeptrain,9,d7cbt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/d7cbt9/random_regression/,14,1569110497.0,"Guys I feel desperate for some help. DD is 5 months old, and seemed to already have gone through the four month regression. Up until a few nights ago, she was sleeping though the night with 1-2 wake ups. Naps are only 40 minutes long, 4 times a day.

I know it wasn’t best practice but getting her to sleep was pretty easy for me; I would rock her to sleep and set her down in the crib no problem. She wouldn’t normally go over 2 hours of being awake, normally it was 1.5 hours. About two weeks ago I stopped using the halo sleep sack for all sleep and that was going pretty okay. 

The last three days have been hell. Trying to get her to sleep is such a fight. She pulls at her paci, punches and grabs at me, screams at me and just wiggles her way out of my arms. She normally does this for my husband which is why I do all the sleep stuff, but never has she been like this for me. It’s taking so long for her to calm down she’s ended up skipping lots of naps in the last few days resulting in her being up for 4 or 5 hours at a time. I know that’s WAY too long at her age but I also refuse to spend an hour getting her to sleep for 40 minutes. Even nursing her to sleep stopped working. 

To try and help this yesterday I tried to put her down drowsy but awake. What a joke. I got her to fall asleep in the crib a few times but it didn’t last long, maybe 20 minutes at the most. And that’s after standing at her crib consoling her for 20 minutes. 

Her night time sleep has started to suffer now too. Past two nights she wakes up way earlier than normal (11ish) and won’t go down for over an hour. I rock, I nurse, she has her paci and she’s just awake as day. Refusing to go back to sleep. One of these times it took over two hours to get her back to sleep. Then she’s up again in just a couple hours doing the same thing.

Naptime advice needed - 11 week old 😁,sleeptrain,2,d7a8qq,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/d7a8qq/naptime_advice_needed_11_week_old/,6,1569099921.0,"Hi All, 

Hoping for a bit of advice on naps for my 11 week old. 
I know it's too early to sleep train and to be honest she is doing brilliantly at bed time. 
We have a nice little routine and she normally drops off after 5 minutes or so and only wakes for one feed during the night. She roughly goes from 7-7:30 until between 2 and 3, has a feed then goes back down until 7. 

The one thing I'm struggling with is nap time. 
Firstly, there doesn't seem to be any kind of pattern, I just know that she starts to get niggly around 90 minutes after waking. 
Secondly, I cannot seem to get her down for naps. She can be very drowsy or even sometimes asleep but as soon as I put her in her cot she wakes up and will just play in her cot. 
It's making things quite difficult as obviously when she is awake I am playing with her, feeding, changing etc. and could do with using the nap times to grab a bite to eat myself, put a wash on etc. 
I could leave her in her cot to play but then I worry if she doesn't get a decent nap it will mess up her night time due to over-tiredness. 

So basically I'm wondering is there anything you did prior to training that might help me get her to nap in her cot, rather than on my chest or in my arms? 
Even if it's just one of her naps she goes in her cot it would help me massively.","Naptime advice needed - 11 week old 😁Hi All,

I know sleep crutches arent ideal but I figured if this was as worse as it was going to get, no problem, it was fine. We had to use Ferber on my toddler and it had been rough. 

we do not have a separate bedroom for the baby. he was supposed to share a room with the toddler and it worked well for about a week but then the toddler kept climbing into the baby's crib even after we rearranged the furniture and put up a gate. 

the baby had been sleeping fine in the bassinet like I said, but a few nights ago he decided not only to learn to sit up, but to pop up on his knees so that one morning I woke up to see him basically hanging out of the bassinet. that was the end of that. 

we are having a VERY VERY VERY hard time transitioning to the pack n play. I added some padding under the fitted sheet to make it a tad softer. I tried moving him to the other side of the room so he cannot see me as easily. I dont go into the room while he is settling down. 

He is going down at 6:30/7, fussing a bit, then waking up 8:30 or so and is inconsolable. It's 10:30 now and this has been going on for hours. If I go in there it makes it worse. I tried tylenol incase he is teething. binkie doesnt help. bottle doesnt help (even though he has been night weened or a long time). the second he feels us starting to put him down into the pack n play  he starts howling. 

We arent even sleeping in our own room at night because it is impossible to just let him cry a bit when we are RIGHT THERE. He is okay if we bring him into the bed but that is not safe as he is very mobile now and I dont want to get back in that habit. 

he takes great naps in the crib and we have a pretty consistent food/sleep schedule. This is not a problem with that.

Naps and the pacifier after weaning it at night,sleeptrain,6,d6yg38,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/d6yg38/naps_and_the_pacifier_after_weaning_it_at_night/,2,1569030322.0,"So we’ve had great night success with Ferber to wean the pacifier for my almost 6 month old. Yay!

I’m now trying to figure out what I need to do about naps as I suppose I probably should wean the paci then as well and start putting him down awake (he now cuddles me with his paci until very drowsy at naptime  and I transfer him). We’ve just started getting chunky naps and I’m generally waking him at 1.5h, 1h, then 30-40 min. I know at the very least I need to start getting him down awake at naptime before separation anxiety kicks in but I so selfishly love the cuddles. 

So my questions are...
1) do I have to get rid of the paci at naptime? Is it going to come back to bite me in the ass at bedtime if I don’t? How much time do I have? I’d like to wait another week or so until our nights are very solid. 
2) Is my best option to do naptime routine then plunk him in his crib to work it out like we did at bedtime, stopping naptime if he doesn’t fall asleep after 30 min? He very much looks for his paci during his nap routine so I don’t know that I’ll just be able to cuddle him and make him forget the paci. 
3) One nap at a time or all at once? I’ve read both approaches and can see pros and cons of both.

We started to train our 5.5 month 7 days ago with night routine of boob (we aim to start at 6:00), diaper, massage, boob, sleeping bag and story, white noise on, lullaby, put down awake (around 6:30). 

The first two nights had some variables (I.e. a sleep nest inside the crib). From day 3 everything’s the same.

She now realise that we’ll leave her to sleep, and would cry as soon as we reach the white noise and lullaby stage. She even cry at nap time as well (we are not nap training yet, well we tried on day 3 and it didn’t go well, so will tackle that later).

Night 3:  1 hour 22 mins
Night 4: 25 min
Night 5: 18 min

Overall, she stays asleep overnight much better now 💪👍. Although I‘d hope by now she wouldn’t cry or fuss for as long, poor little girl.

2. I keep the room dark, the book says to say to do the 5 minute check where baby can see and hear you. I don’t think she can see me, and I have to raise my voice quite a bit to ensure she can hear me.
3. Her naps are getting worse 😫. It used to take maybe 5-10 mins to get her to nap (follow the huckleberry app suggestion). She’ll do maybe 2X40 mins naps and one around 1.5 hours. Now her naps are usually under 40 mins and takes way longer to put her to sleep. Maybe because she’d start to cry when she sense I’ll put her to sleep.
4. Her last nap generally finishes between 3-4. So the last awake time sometimes is quite long, but not sure if we move to an earlier time would result her waking up even earlier. On average, she does 10.5 hours sleep at night). So she woke up a few times before 6 already.

My Child Is An Early Bird – Can I Do Something About It?

Early morning waking is one of the toughest sleep problems to fix, if not the toughest. If you’re wondering why it’s because after a decent night’s rest your child has got more energy to fight sleep in the morning. And the truth is, all of us come up into lighter sleep phases in the last hour of our sleep, preparing to take up for the day. 

Remember, however, your child is waking early only if he is not getting the right amount of night rest for his age and his body. In other words, if your child sleeps from 7 PM to 6 AM, it’s a perfectly reasonable schedule for him, even though it might feel early to you.

We can’t ask our children to sleep more than 11 hours at night. Their bodies are usually rested after this much sleep, and they won’t be able to do more.

Also, keep in mind the following fact: if your child is waking even at 10/½ hours if he is rested and energetic in the morning and makes it easily till his naptime, then he’s getting enough rest for his body.

Problems arise if your child sleeps from, say, 7 PM to 5:30 AM. In this case, you’ll need to push the bedtime later by 15-minute increments, then watching to see if your child can sleep later in the morning,

A word of caution, though: Making the bedtime later can often have the opposite effect of causing your child to wake up earlier. This is the reason why things need to be done in small steps.

Here are some other ideas to try if your child is an early bird:

· Make sure that your child’s room is very, very dark.

· If there are any sounds that could be waking him – such as garbage trucks, barking dogs, sprinklers – put white noise in the room and make the volume loud enough to protect him from these sounds

· Remove all stimulating toys from your child’s crib or bed, which can be distracting once the sun enters his room.

· If you are checking in on your child within the last hour before his wake time, your interaction may prevent him from returning to sleep. Don’t check on him if it’s less than one hour till his wake time.

· Make sure the bedtime is not too late for your child’s age. Adjust the bedtime earlier by 15-minute increments, and watch what happens in the morning. In doing so, you will allow your child to sleep later, as he is less overtired at bedtime. If he does wake earlier, return to your previous bedtime. If moving the bedtime earlier has no effect on the wake time, you may want to consider using the earlier bedtime anyway to help your child get the right amount of night sleep for his age.

· Make sure your child is not hungry. If you have a child under 12 months and have newly begun to wean feedings, you may want to slow the process down to give him more time to adjust. Moreover, be careful to ensure that you are offering the breast or bottle more often during the day to help him transition his previous nighttime feeds to the daytime, so he won’t be hungry going down for sleep at night.","Nighttime Sleep baby  

My Child Is An Early Bird – Can I Do Something About It?

Early morning waking is one of the toughest sleep problems to fix, if not the toughest. If you’re wondering why it’s because after a decent night’s rest your child has got more energy to fight sleep in the morning. And the truth is, all of us come up into lighter sleep phases in the last hour of our sleep, preparing to take up for the day. 

Remember, however, your child is waking early only if he is not getting the right amount of night rest for his age and his body. In other words, if your child sleeps from 7 PM to 6 AM, it’s a perfectly reasonable schedule for him, even though it might feel early to you.

We can’t ask our children to sleep more than 11 hours at night. Their bodies are usually rested after this much sleep, and they won’t be able to do more.

Also, keep in mind the following fact: if your child is waking even at 10/½ hours if he is rested and energetic in the morning and makes it easily till his naptime, then he’s getting enough rest for his body.

Problems arise if your child sleeps from, say, 7 PM to 5:30 AM. In this case, you’ll need to push the bedtime later by 15-minute increments, then watching to see if your child can sleep later in the morning,

A word of caution, though: Making the bedtime later can often have the opposite effect of causing your child to wake up earlier. This is the reason why things need to be done in small steps.

Here are some other ideas to try if your child is an early bird:

· Make sure that your child’s room is very, very dark.

· If there are any sounds that could be waking him – such as garbage trucks, barking dogs, sprinklers – put white noise in the room and make the volume loud enough to protect him from these sounds

· Remove all stimulating toys from your child’s crib or bed, which can be distracting once the sun enters his room.

· If you are checking in on your child within the last hour before his wake time, your interaction may prevent him from returning to sleep. Don’t check on him if it’s less than one hour till his wake time.

· Make sure the bedtime is not too late for your child’s age. Adjust the bedtime earlier by 15-minute increments, and watch what happens in the morning. In doing so, you will allow your child to sleep later, as he is less overtired at bedtime. If he does wake earlier, return to your previous bedtime. If moving the bedtime earlier has no effect on the wake time, you may want to consider using the earlier bedtime anyway to help your child get the right amount of night sleep for his age.

· Make sure your child is not hungry. If you have a child under 12 months and have newly begun to wean feedings, you may want to slow the process down to give him more time to adjust.

My 8 month old has been eating 2-3 times a night + I've been feeding him to sleep so we decided to start fixing both those problems Tuesday night. 

We moved his feed to the beginning of his bedtime routine, and then Dad puts him down around 8pm. This part has been going better than expected with very little crying and he's out within 5 minutes.

I decided to keep his 10pm feed for now since I'm awake anyway. I've been trying to turn it into a dream feed by sneaking in a little early, but so far he has woken up anyway. Not sure if it's really an issue or not because he always goes right back to sleep when I put him down, but often while he's still on the boob he's out.

His feeding schedule has been: 10pm, ~2 or 3am, 5 am, then wake for the day sometime between 6:30 or 7:30, usually closer to 6:30. I have been trying to get rid of his 5am feed first because that is the one that really kills me. He has not been liking that at all so far. We have been doing extinction method and he cries on and off between 5 and 6, and also has started waking to cry for a while earlier in the night when he normally wouldn't even be wanting to eat. 

Between still feeding him around 2 or 3 and listening to him cry at all hours of then night I am running out of steam fast so I just want to know if I'm doing something wrong. When we did Ferber at 5 months he went to crying less than 5 minutes any time he woke up within 3 days. IDK if we should go back to Ferber because check ins seem to make him mad.","Night weaning is roughI have no idea if I'm doing this right.

As the title says, we have a 6 month old, who was previously sleep trained and is regressing. LO still goes to sleep without a problem, but won't stay asleep (1-4 awakenings a night, usually 2-3). This began after an illness 3 weeks ago, but instead of resolving within a few days of feeling better as it has in the past, his nighttime awakenings are not resolving and may be becoming more frequent. We are unsure what is going on with the LO, so we are unsure how to resolve the issue. 
We tried giving LO pain meds thinking it was teething related which seemed to help, but we are not comfortable giving LO medication every night especially when LO seems fine during the day. We found that giving LO a large bottle 30 minutes before bed helps push the first awakening back, but does not stop them. LO does not feed most of the time when LO wakes up at night and doesn't seem hungry, but I will admit as the number of awakenings in an evening increase, the likelihood of the LO breastfeeding also go up because honestly, I want LO to go to bed so I can too. We have tried letting LO cry; the cries are more half-asleep whining than true crying, but either 1) LO will cry like this for 20-30 min and fall back asleep for a half hour to then repeat the cycle, or 2) LO will wake up enough to actually cry, in which case one of us will go check on LO after a few minutes of ""true crying"". 
We have also tried picking LO up to try to see if this is some separation anxiety or if LO needs attention. The response to being held is either 1) immediate resolution of crying and attempting to go back to sleep or 2) carrying on, wiggling, and acting uncomfortable/irritable. Once you lay LO back in the crib, LO will resume crying, and oftentimes moves to a seated or crawling pose before you can even reach the door. We have also tried letting LO fall back asleep while being held (sometimes we need sleep too), but LO now wakes up mad as soon as you lay baby down and oftentimes continue to cry until we break down and pick the baby up again. 
Maybe there is a few things going on (teething, anxiety/wanting cuddling, developmental milestones, nightmares?), but it seems like any method we use is not working. 

Maybe we should go back to letting him cry it out for 10-15 min then going in and verbally reassuring him and repeating this cycle to see if it ends up working if we try for longer??

Whenever I try to calm her in the cot she becomes inconsolable (we usually nurse to sleep and I sway her asleep after bedtime). 

My questions are:

Do I get her to just stop crying and leave or do I really get her calmed down? (She normally cries the second I leave but if I stay in the room she just gets mad that I haven’t picked her up)

We will be training our 6.5 ish month old on Saturday. Probably full extinction as I’m fairly certain she will get pissed off if we enter and don’t pick her up or anything. 

I’ve tried following sleepy cues and wake windows but even bouncing to sleep is taking 40 ish minutes now and she makes her sleepy sounds and cries on and off while we bounce ( so I figure why not cio since she’s crying with us anyways.) will not fully mastering her wake window cause us problems? 

Currently I make sure the last nap of the day ends at 5. We eat, and play for a bit, go for a walk from 6-7, nurse at 710-715ish and am upstairs to start bedtime routine by 720/730. We do a diaper change, let her crawl around naked for a little bit while her night time lotion dries a bit, jammies, zipadee zip, story, then bounce to sleep with the goal being asleep by 8, and it usually happens anywhere between 805-815 but the bouncing starts at about 745/750 depending on if she starts yawning. One day she woke up from her last nap at 415, she was asleep by 730 and we started that final nurse and bedtime routine around 645 to keep the same sched.

2. Is it normal that she normally wakes up with her annoyed cry around 4am? PS: today has been an exception, she got up around 1am with her hungry cry so I fed her and put her back down and she was up again right before 3 with her annoyed cry. I let her CIO until about 330am and came in to changed her diaper and tried to rock her(unsuccessful) so I fed her a bit and put her back down. 
3. Am I doing this right?? Anything i should be doing? Adding a dream feed at 10pm? So hopefully she doesn’t wake up around 2-3am for a feeding? 
4. I heard you aren’t supposed to tend to them at all between 4-6am is that true?

To start we have a very consistent bed time routing (515 bath, 530 feed and mum cuddles, 6pm book and dad cuddles, 615-630 lights out). He has always been a terrible sleeper and we know its down to a strong association with breast feeding. So enough is enough and wife is ready to get this tackled, we're going to night wean starting yesterday (using a 5 day gradual extinction).

Here's the issue though, yesterday as soon as i lay him down he stood up and started crying, this will settle and then he will sit quietly for a period, then stand, sit, stand, sit on repeat and eventually just sit there...no crying, fighting sleep, and definitely not lying down. I saw his heading bobbing after 2 hours so went in lied him down and left... and all that happened is the process repeated. Eventually after 4-5 hours of this thought enough was enough and went up lied him down and patted his chest until he fell asleep...he slept 1 hour and then got up again!!

What do we do? Ferber talks about going in when they're crying which he isn't, CIO is not going in at all but 6 hours of being sat silent is destroying my wife and isn't particularly great for me either tbh. 

Current thoughts is getting the night weaning done, leave him for 30 mins initially at bedtime and after feeds and then i'll keep lying him down until he stays lied down and goes to sleep.

Start bedtime routine with a book to calm him down.

Wake him up if he has fallen asleep and put on PJs. (This part stresses me out because last time I tried this he was really mad about being woken up).

I'm a bit apprehensive because I feel like it must have been a fluke or something. The 8 month regression hit us hard. We've been feeding to sleep every night and putting him in his crib asleep. Which had been working for us, save the 4 month regression but that didn't last long. He'd wake up 1-2 times a night to be fed back to sleep, sometimes he'd randomly sleep through the night. I knew feeding to sleep wasn't a good habit, but it's hard to stop doing something if it's working. But the 8 month regression hit and he was up literally every 45 minutes to an hour, not wanting to go back to sleep at all unless we rocked him, and even then we had to put him in his crib fully asleep only to be awake again in 45 minutes. So I made the decision to do CIO last night while my husband was out of town. I switched up the routine and fed him, then changed into jammies, then read a story and sang a song. He was tired and rubbing his eyes so I put him in his crib awake and said goodnight and walked out. I had intended to do ferber with checks at 5 min, 10 min, etc. But I watched on the monitor and he did a couple laps crawling around the crib, babbled to his stuffed dog, then laid down and went to sleep! Surely it can't be this easy, right? He did wake up once, truly hungry as he downed a 5 oz bottle in 2 minutes. I put him back down after he ate and he screamed for 3 minutes and then fell asleep.

Now I'm wondering of I should just do extinction tonight if he protests bedtime, since he clearly knows how to put himself to sleep. I had planned on doing checks because I figured he'd cry a lot more at first since we have never put him to bed awake. And I'm also wondering what I should do if he wakes up and cries before a reasonable time to eat. Checks? CIO? Anyone else have experience with a great first night followed by a bad second night?

We sleep trained her at about 6mos with the extinction CIO method and it worked quite well. But nowadays she is more physically developed. As such, when she wakes at night she rolls all over the place, gets her legs stuck in the crib slats, jams herself in the corner/edge, and discovered today that she can go from laying down to sitting totally independently. So I've been going to her more at night just to keep her from injuring herself. And nursing her so that she'll calm down enough not to just repeat the aforementioned activities.

It's also tricky because most of her wakings (sometimes 5+ a night, as opposed to the 1-2 she had gotten down to) are happening in the early morning hours when I know it's harder for them to self-soothe regardless of a regression.

She has never once slept in her crib on her back since I stopped swaddling her at 5 months old, now she will only sleep on her stomach, and usually requires more than one attempt to get her to stay asleep when I put her down. I comfort nurse her to sleep because that’s the only thing that’s ever worked. 

Even when she was a newborn she would rarely sleep for more than 90 minutes, typically only one hour at a time. Naps are inconsistent as are wake times because I have two older children who’s schedules my life revolves around, so my 9 month old typically only naps in the car or cat naps while I’m nursing her. She is breastfed, eats great, very happy and smily all day, hitting all her normal developmental milestones, but every single night after night is absolute shit. 

I have had to let her cry herself to sleep a handful of times, but it wasn’t really intentional so much as I was simply too exhausted and falling asleep and recognized it wasn’t safe for me to hold her any longer so I had to put her in her crib and then I just passed out. I started using the swing because I felt like the only place she sleeps well is in her car seat but that the swing might be safer? I also tried a Merlin’s magic sleep suit — she rolled right over. Tried a vibrating pad under the mattress, various types of white noise, tv, and even cosleeping. Nothing I’ve done has gotten her to sleep consistently or for any significant length of time. 

Sleeping through the night is a far off dream, I just want to have a sound sleep plan and not be desperately flying by the seat of my pants every night after exhausted. The swing isn’t even that effective. She has zero interest in pacifiers (although I’ve tried many) and rarely takes a bottle. 

You guys, I need help!!! I didn’t have to sleep train my other two. When they were 9 months they were usually only waking once a night for a dream feed, and they both slept on their backs in their cribs. That’s literally not an option for her. The past week or so I’ve attempted to just let her cry and see what happens a few times (watched her on video monitor) but she either stands or sits up and never came close to comforting herself. When I would go in after a few timed periods of letting her cry she would just get even madder. Should I be putting her in her crib still awake? Should I go in when she cries at night? Stop nursing her at night? I still have a hard time with the process of putting her to sleep initially and especially setting her down... I still haven’t managed to do it successfully yet tonight and I’ve tried 3 times. Then the middle of the night wakeups....  I’m just at a loss and because nothing works plus she’s pretty accustomed to sleeping in the swing/car seat or my arms, I have no clue what to do. Any advice would be appreciated!","Please help!

Night 3 of extinction - Odd behavior,sleeptrain,2,d51qm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/d51qm1/night_3_of_extinction_odd_behavior/,9,1568674324.0,"Daughter is 19 weeks old, we are attempting extinction as we transitioned her to her crib. We believe we have gone through the 4 month sleep regressions a couple weeks ago, as she starting waking every 2-3 hours from normally sleeping from 8pm to 5:30am (start of her day), she is now back to feeding 1x/night (ish)

**Night 1**: asleep within 5 minutes, not much crying, slept on her back. Slept from 7pm to 5:15am. Could it really be this easy? Of course not :)

**Night 2**: asleep within 20 minutes, more crying. Woke up hungry at 2-3 am, fed her and put her down, kept rolling to her belly (we rolled back once) cried for 1 hour before sleeping again until 5:00 am. 

**Night 3**: asleep within 30 minutes, similar to night 2. More rolling onto belly, is fine until she does, then cries. From 12-3am she kept waking up every 30 minutes and whined for 5-10 minutes, this cycle lasted until my wife fed her at 3am, then she was fine on her back for an hour or so then woke up crying (was back on her belly), cried for a while then slept until 5:15 again with 1-2 wake ups with some minor whining. 

This is the same for naps - she keeps rolling over, freaks out and gets frustrated and cries. I feel like if she could just stay on her back or only roll to her side she  would sleep or nap perfectly.

&#x200B;

* Any suggestion for the rolling over besides just letting her figure out how to sleep on her belly?   

* Any ideas what was going on for the night waking in a 30-40 minute cycle for night 3?  

&#x200B;

Note: we are not using a pacifier because it falls out and she can't put it back in herself unless it is right next to her face. Also just found this subreddit and did not know about doing nap extinction after sleep training. We started with both at the same time at home for this weekend, she is in daycare during the week so we will see how she does there today.","Night 3 of extinction - Odd behaviorDaughter is 19 weeks old, we are attempting extinction as we transitioned her to her crib.

Tonight she fell asleep in 5 minutes with no crying! She sleeps though the night with two dream feeds. Previously she was nursed to sleep and slept in my bed with me...all the hard to break habits. 

I just have to say, one thing to remember is that your baby feeds off your energy. I learned this the hard way. Around night 3/4 I started dreading her bedtime because the crying was so difficult for me. During bedtime routine I was anxious and nervous, I know she could see it on my face and feel it in my body. So she started getting upset at bedtime routine. Every evening, hell even every time I just went to change her diaper during the day, she would start crying and get upset. Then once she started falling asleep easier, I quit dreading it, and lightened up during bedtime routine. Tonight she was smiling at me and so calm when I laid her down in her crib and it was a wonderful feeling. And also, don’t be afraid to switch things up a little bit with the routine. They get so used to doing the same thing over and over that I think that makes it easier for them to get upset. If you baby starts crying at the beginning of the routine, do something different next. If you usually give a bottle, pick her up and rock her around to some music, or read a book first. It will break their attention a little bit and possibly change the mood. 

So remember to just relax, take deep breaths and enjoy the bedtime routine and that time with your baby!

First night she cried pretty much non stop for 8-9 hours. Within that time she fell asleep once on her own and twice with a bottle at the 3 hour increments. Only for a few minutes each time. The second night she cried for 3 hours straight and we threw in the towel. Co slept up until now and man are we paying for it, she's now 11 months. The only immediate question I can think of is how long should we let her cry before trying again tomorrow, then the next day, etc. If she doesn't fall asleep and just cries we're at a loss. Last time we tried going in at 10 minute intervals and it just pissed her off more. No calming down. Any words of wisdom from people with tough babies like her?

Update 1 - been an hour and 10 minutes, she's still awake. She whined for 45 minutes or so standing and moving around, now she's been just sitting up for 25 minutes. Going better than I thought this time, I for sure thought she'd just cry uncontrollably for the entire time. But still no sign of sleep at all

Update 2 - she fell asleep thankfully shortly after the first update at 910-915. She was nodding off and eventually gently folded over like a lawn chair. I had to go and get her onto her back so she wasn't in a bad spot. Not all good news though, she had pooped :/ so I had to wake her to change a rather full diaper to avoid rash and further discomfort. Back to crying and sitting up again. Hopefully she falls back asleep in a shorter time this go around. Sigh*

Update 3 - been altering between sitting and dozing, light crying, or standing for the last hour and a half almost. This is so disheartening. 1040

Update 4 - She finally fell back asleep at 11 and slept until 1245 or so. My wife was feeling sick last night and couldn't lay down and sleep until 1230. So as she was falling asleep or daughter was waking up. She woke and quietly rolled around for ten minutes before starting to cry, had my wife felt fine we would've done a night feed and went back to crib but at that point my wife just needed sleep so she co-slept.

Anyway lately during her daytime naps she will wake up screaming her head off. I have to go in there and put her back to sleep maybe 2 or 3 times. Then she sometimes wakes up in a bad mood. 
We got rid of all the bottles recently and have been trying to limit her binky to only bedtime. But man it is hard to soothe her now. I have tried letting her cry it out but man oh man does she get SO upset. It seems like it is traumatizing her. Ive yet to let her scream until she passes out. I always give in and go sooth her. She sleeps in my bed and its just gotten exhausting. Ive tried putting her in her own room but she screams there too and ends up back in my bed.
I now understand why sleep training is important when they are babies. Its hard with her being a toddler. Her screams are so much louder and heart wrenching and gosh her feelings seem so hurt. I dont want her to think she is all alone or that I dont love her. I hope I havent ruined her for when she is an adult and needs to self soothe.

My spouse and I have decided to sleep train our baby who is 9 months old. My daughter was co-sleeping with my wife during nap time times and night time, especially at 3 months when my daughter had eczema flare ups.

My wife end up getting a good job opportunity and went to back to work when my daughter 7 months old. During this time my mother in law and I have been taking care of her during the day; however, we both have different routines for nap time and couldnt get on the same page.

The nap routine is so confusing between my mother in law and I... it takes 2 hours of rocking, tapping, and hushing before finally having my daughter sleep. She only sleeps for 30 minutes straight on the dot and unable to sooth herself back to sleep. 

Due to this issue, we ended up getting a sleep consultant service that last for 10 sessions.

So far, it takes less than 10 mins to put my daughter to sleep during her nap times and night time. However, it pains me to hear her cry and protest before she passes out from crying. She can sooth herself when she wakes up in the middle of night in less than 10 mins; however the crying and neglecting makes us feel shameful as parents.

Prior to sleep training, my daughter was so bubbly, happy, and interactive. Now that were in day 4 of sleep training.. we noticed that her bubbly self isnt the same. She doesnt laugh or smile as often and engage when I call her name. She isnt as interested with her toys anymore as she used to be....

Overall, we feel like we ruined our child by sleep training. Yes there has been progress when putting her down to sleep but we notice a slight change her personality. 

Anyone went through sleep training and reverted back to co sleeping? Anyone for or against sleep training? Any advice, suggestion, or insight will be helpful.

Possibly relevant context: Before baby came we were big in to sleep routine. We read a lot in to sleep health and on most nights would be in bed by latest 10pm.

At around 6 weeks we started the Taking Cara Babies newborn course. Found it overall really helpful as newbie parents who knew nothing about reading sleepy cues, how often babies that age sleep through the day etc.
The SITBACK method is really affective with out buba and we generally find it easy to settle him.

We now do bedtime routine in calm/dark bedroom between 7-8pm. Baby massage, swaddle, white noise etc. Dreamfeed at 10ish with morning wakeup and feed at 5am.

Bedtime routine goes well, maybe a couple of sessions of getting him down properly but then he's out for the count.
Dreamfeeds are hit and miss. He often doesn't eat much or anything at all, even when we're stubborn about getting him quite awake. Cool, fine, I trust he would let us know if he's hungry.
He goes back to deep sleep immediately.

Then the trouble starts.
Between 1am and 4am it's pretty much a constant soothing job. He never seems to fully wake up but is grunting, shuffling, leg kicking and always eventually crying every 20-40mins.
If the pacifier comes out it escalates quickly.
We can soothe him by putting it back in and rocking/shushing (rarely have to take him out of crib and not done a night feed in weeks)

He's a pretty gassy boy right now and we know big farts upset him so that probably doesn't help.

Daytime naps are pretty easy and he sleeps in his crib, swaddled with white noise but with blinds open and we don't make an effort to keep quiet around the house.
He eats every two hours and naps about an hour after that like clockwork throughout the day.

On the one hand he's technically going the full night but the clincher is that we're not! We're trying to take shifts but it's taking a toll I guess because we start doubting a lot.
I'm telling myself that he's maybe too young to sleep properly at night but our hard work is setting foundations for the future.

I guess we just need some support or reassurance from fellow parents!","Tired new parents need some reassurance: What can we expect at this stage?First time parents of a 10 week old and feel a bit stuck (or possibly just need a reality check with patience...open to that!)

Possibly relevant context: Before baby came we were big in to sleep routine. We read a lot in to sleep health and on most nights would be in bed by latest 10pm.

Our problem is his persistent 11:30 wakings. We've tried (for several periods of 5-7 nights) since he was 5 months old to apply the same method of gradual extinction that we do at bedtime. It doesn't work! Half the time he'll carry on crying for up to an hour and a half, even two hours, (at which point I soothe him to sleep).

After this initial waking, he'll wake every 3 hours so approx 2:30 and 5:30. I feed him, because I'm too tired from the earlier waking to do anything else.

Thinking of starting Ferber tonight - send me tips and well wishes!,sleeptrain,1,d3ls0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/d3ls0v/thinking_of_starting_ferber_tonight_send_me_tips/,4,1568388786.0,"Hi guys.

A bit of background from me and babygirl! Babygirl is 18 weeks old, and from 6 weeks old we started implementing Taking Cara Babies newborn class. Magically by 8 weeks we had a baby that fell asleep unaided, slept 7pm-7am with a dream feed at 10:30pm, and by 10 weeks we’d also dropped the dream feed (she dropped all night feeds herself, and is definitely getting enough calories during the day).

These glorious 12 hour nights went on until she was about 12/13 weeks old and since that point she has regressed hard.

She now sleeps through roughly 1 night a week, and the nights she doesn’t she varies between waking up to 9 times for 10 mins a time, or waking once for 3 hours. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to it, and we have followed TCB religiously during this period.

Now, for day naps babygirl will still fall asleep unaided including in her cot (we just put her down, turn her white noise on, and walk out. She’s usually asleep within 10 minutes and there’s never any crying), but bedtime we work through SITBACK usually at least twice (which she cries right through until she nods off) and her middle of the night wakings are a mixture of multiple runs of SITBACK and she’s awake 3 hours, or she’s only awake a few minutes each time and falls asleep at increased white noise but we suffer as we’re up and down all night (though we do have times she self soothes before we get to that part, but we’re still being woken up multiple times).

As we know she is capable of self soothing and going to sleep without our intervention we’re keen to get back to better sleep for her and us. TCB just doesn’t seem to be working anymore so I think it’s time for a new approach.

I also struggle with severe insomnia, so once I’m disturbed in the night I really struggle to go back to sleep. This means some nights I’m only getting 2-3hrs before I’m staring at the ceiling until morning whether babygirl is awake or not. This is severely impacting my PND which had been improving, and to be honest I’m just completely miserable through being exhausted all the time. So basically I need to try and rectify the situation and get her back to sleeping better seen as we know she is capable of it.

I also want to add that I watch her wake windows religiously and ensure she is awake at least 120 mins before putting her in her cot. Any less and she just cries for longer, much more and she ventures into over tired, but I’m more than happy to take suggestions on this if people think we should be stretching it out? She also has 4 naps a day with a total of 3hr45 daytime sleep on average).

I’ve been doing a lot of research and as babygirl cries more or less through SITBACK anyway (at bedtime and MOTN) I’ve decided maybe we should just try Ferber.

I understand Ferber says the method can be used from 3-4 months once night feeds have been eliminated and we tick that box.

I’ve found some guides online re timings, and also only to stay in the room 1-2 mins for check ins.

So throw your other tips at me guys! What shall I do during check ins? Is there a point in time I bail (for example what if she’s been crying for over an hour do you just stick with the checks indefinitely)? Do I implement this at nap time too, not that we usually have any issues with her day sleep but just so I know just in case?

Edited to add - babygirl has also started waking at 5am some days. Our current plan is to work through SITBACK until 6am as this is the earliest we want her to think it’s morning, and then we get her up once it’s passed 6am (she’s usually fed around 6:30am these days and most of the time wakes at 6:15am). How do I handle this with Ferber? Do I just continue with the checks as normal? Do I still get her up after 6am or am I just teaching her that eventually I’ll come get her?

I would nurse her until she fell into a deep sleep, and then carefully transfer her to the crib. I had about a 50% success rate. I would always pick her up as soon as she started crying because I assumed the longer she cried, the more awake she would become and the harder it would be to get her to sleep again.

The other night, after like 5 tries, I gave up and left her crying in her crib while I went downstairs to get a snack, planning to eat quickly and then go try again. To my surprise, she was sleeping when I came back up! I thought it might be a fluke but I let her cry again last night when I put her down, and she fell asleep again after only crying for about 2 minutes! 

And today, she fell asleep on her play mat for the first time. I usually have to perform the whole nurse/rock/transfer in a dark room with white noise bedtime routine for her to nap. 

It feels like someone took away my old, poor-sleeper baby and gave me a baby who sleeps amazing! I hope this lasts, but know by now not to expect that, so I plan to enjoy it while I can.","3 month old sleep success!

Any advice on how to get a more regular overall schedule for ST nearly 11-month old? Battling variable bedtime and early wakings.,sleeptrain,3,d2vvgm,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/d2vvgm/any_advice_on_how_to_get_a_more_regular_overall/,8,1568260245.0,"We sleep-trained our girl at 8months and she is now nearly 11months. We used Ferber, then extinction. It was a rollercoaster, but she mostly sleeps through the night. She doesn't have much issue going to sleep, but I am struggling to get any kind of rhythm going, because her wake-up time varies, which alters first nap time, then her nap duration is all over the place...same with second nap... and then of course her bedtime is different. And I can't tell anymore where the issue is that might have started it? Or if we have multiple issues?

We thought we remedied her early waking issue by darkening the room. It helped for awhile. Now she will sometimes wake between 5-5:45a. It seems like she wakes up, and realizes all her binkies are out of the crib, so she won't go back to sleep. She will occasionally go back to sleep if I replace the binkies, but replacing them is no guarantee. She also has often had an INSANELY full diaper, including poop. Then I think, well no wonder she isn't going back to sleep.

I've been trying to regulate her days, but she is so sensitive to her awake windows, that I can't do too much change without throwing those off and risking her being over or under-tired. 

* She wakes up between 5a - 6:30a (6:30a is becoming more rare). If she gets up earlier than 6a, I have been trying to replace her binkies and doing a diaper check. I'm sure this is part of the problem, but her cries get hysterical and while I am cool with CIO at certain times... 5:30a seems harsh? No matter when she gets up, first nap is 3 hours after ideal wake time. So usually 9a (later if she wakes later than 6a).
* First nap is 30m - 1hr 20m. Closer to an hour. If she sleeps less than an hour, I've been letting her nap on me (if she doesn't soothe within 10-15mins). I know this is a no-no, but I am so worried about her being overtired and not getting enough nap time.
* Second awake window is typically 3.5 hours. 
* Second nap is anywhere between 1:30p and 3p. Super variable time based on whenever she went down for Nap 1 and how long she slept. Again, it is 30m - 1hr 20m. If I'm worried she won't get a minimum of 2hrs of naps, I let her nap on me if she doesn't soothe within 10-15mins.
* Final awake window is typically 3.5 - 3.75hrs.
* Bedtime is ranging beween 6:40p - 7:40p, which seems like way too long of a window. I fear we are messing with her circadian rhythm and she can't get into a cycle.

When I look at her averages in Huckleberry, her average nightly hours have gone from 10hr 40m, to 10hr 5m. She has had 11hr or 12hr nights, but they are rare (boo). Her nap average has remained fairly steady over last month at around 2hr 20m - 2hr 30m. Average daily sleep over last 30 days was 13hr 20m, down to 12hr 40m the last week.

She also just started walking and has teeth coming in up the wazoo, so who knows how much all of that is playing a role.

Any advice on where we are going wrong?? Or what I can try changing to see if it helps?? A lot of websites state babies her age get 14 hours of sleep... She is definitely under that and I think she may be a baby that just needs less. But under 13hrs seems rough.

Thanks for all the encouragement from people on this sub to help us bite the bullet! 

I found all the recap posts so helpful when figuring out what to do so posting mine now. By day 3 I was singing the praises of sleep training. Last night (night 4) was tough though and I’m getting cold feet again - there were a lot of Mama tears! Don’t know if it was an extinction burst or if I did something wrong so hoping for some advice for tonight. Nightly recap below + questions at the bottom. Note: I’m not night weaning at this time but trying to follow 5/3/3. 

NIGHT 1
- Bed at 7pm, cried 27 minutes, asleep 7:30 (checks x3 @ 3/5/10 min)
- 2 feeds: 2:15 and 5:30
- Mild fussing (&amp;lt;3 min) twice overnight and at 6:30am, he settled himself
- Up at 7:20am 
- TOTAL CRYING: 27 min

NIGHT 2
- Bed at 7:15, asleep 7:17 with mild crying (no checks) 
- 2 feeds: 12:50 and 3:55
- Mild fussing a couple times  (&amp;lt;1 min) between 5:45 and 6:10
- Up at 6:37am 
- TOTAL CRYING: 2 min

NIGHT 3
- Bed at 7:22, mild fussing when I put him in the crib but quiet by the time I got to the stairs, asleep 7:25 (no checks)
- 2 feeds: 1:05, 3:55
- MOTN wake at 10:51. Fussing escalating to light crying. Check after 10 min after which he went right to sleep. 
- Up at 6:47
- TOTAL CRYING: 10 min (MOTN)

NIGHT 4
- Bed at 7:14, some wiggling and asleep at 7:19 (no checks, crying)
- MOTN wake: started fussing at 9:50 escalating to intense crying until almost 11:30. I gave up at 11:30 and fed him. Checks at 40/55/85/100 min (they’re a bit sporadic because he sometimes stopped crying or went down to fussing so we weren’t quite sure when to start the clock)
- Feeds: 11:30, 2:55
- Up at 6:30 
- TOTAL CRYING: 1 hour 40 min

So my question is - what the hell happened to make him cry for so long last night? I don’t understand why we’re getting a new wake up. Was he actually hungry (I checked his diaper during checks) or should I have ignored him (was it an extinction burst?) or did I mess up his day schedule somehow? Did I take a step backwards by feeding him at 11:30?

For what it’s worth, naps have gotten messy since we started sleep training so his longest nap was his last nap yesterday so we could line up bedtime. He did get a full 3 hour wake window before bed though.","Ferber nights 1-4 recap (generally success + question about MOTN wakes)We started Ferber with our 5.5 month old on Saturday night to help him ditch the paci.

A little background

1. Son is 3 months on the dot. Born 2 weeks early (planned C due to complete placenta previa).
2. Born 6lb12oz, was 12lb7oz as of 2 months - gaining weight extremely fast
3. Generally good sleeper up until a week ago, at 6 weeks we were getting 5/3/3, had a slight regression at 8 weeks related to nursing to sleep, stopped that and moved to rocking/bouncing and moved to a 6/3/2 or 7/3/2, then for about a week we were at 8/4 (I felt like a new human!)
4. Following the 5/3/3 rule for feeds, although he is gaining weight super quick (like 2.5 times normal), which was causing gas pains, reflux and doctor suggested holding off, still follow the 5/3/3 rule but will buy time with diaper change and will see if he will fall asleep when I bounce.
5. When we pick him up in the night he is never crying, he usually just fusses trying to find his thumb, I usually let him fuss for 10 min and as soon as it starts to escalate to more aggressive fussing I pick him up. Should I wait till I get a squawk? Like literally never wakes crying ever. Only starts to cry when we pick him up...
6. Sleeps in Halo bassinet beside us, we are thinking about moving him to his own room/crib, he is an aggressive sleeper constantly kicking legs up and down (super loud - don't know how he doesn't wake himself more than he is). We used to pick him up and we found we picked him up and he was asleep. Sometimes I don't even think his fussing would pick up on monitor....

We have been trying to move his bed time up to between 7:30-8pm, in the last week he has had no issues falling asleep (super quick like 10 min) but his first stretch has greatly declined moving from 5hr to 3hr to last night he was up every hour 8pm, 9pm, 10pm, 11pm, 12pm, fed him at 12pm. Was able to rock him back to sleep at each interval. Finally I fed him at midnight and he slept 2 hours, rocked him till 3 hours and fed again and he slept 3 hours, fed again and slept 3 hours. The night before he slept 3 hours to start and then was up every 2 hours. Here is his general schedule which he followed yesterday (that he has established):

Wake up - 7:00am, not hungry upon wakeup just wide eyed

Feed - 7:30am, still not showing signs of hunger, but we feed him to get his day started

1st Nap - around 8:15am, naps in his swing, I tried and tried in his bassinet but he will not do it. It still takes him 20min to fall asleep in his swing with pacifier and I have to leave the room or he refuses to sleep. I don't let him cry but let him fuss a bit, otherwise he won't sleep :( Will do checks put pacifier in etc. If I wait longer than 1h15min he really struggles and sometimes will not sleep. If he falls asleep he will usually sleep 2-3 hours. Wakes up super happy no tears

Wakeup - 11:15am all happy, turned his swing off at 10:45am, feed right away

2nd nap - 12:45pm, falls asleep by 1pm crap nap till 1:30pm not hungry when wakes

Feed - 2:30pm, starting to get fussy so I feed him

3rd nap - 3:30pm in my arms - will only sleep in my arms, wakes up as soon as I put him down, wakes up at 4:45pm, feed upon waking

Bedtime routine start at 6:30pm, feed at 7pm hard to keep awake while feeding constantly taking off boob, get 20min feed falls asleep right away, then woke an hour later :(

I am wondering if my last wake window is too long - we usually go for a walk before bed and he will get a 10-15min snooze in there which makes him seem more alert during bedtime, have to rock him a bit more.

1-4 more wakings between midnight and 5-6am, either a short “aaaah!” yelp (which wakes just me but not mom) or a few minutes of woe is me protest. Wakes more if didn’t nap well in the previous afternoon-even if it’s 15min vs his typical 45min.

He *was* going back to sleep for 3-4 more hours after this time, getting up for the day at 9-10am, but not the past few days. Still working on back teeth, has a nice new gurgly crying noise, pain reliever doesn’t work for it. Very hard for us to keep quiet during this time with getting ready for the day, but starting our day at 5am or earlier is getting unbearable."

What type of crying is acceptable for the Ferber method?,sleeptrain,18,d2aei5,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/d2aei5/what_type_of_crying_is_acceptable_for_the_ferber/,18,1568162953.0,"My son only cries aggressively (not sure of another way to put) when we try to put him to sleep at night.  I mean it sounds like we are torturing him, we never hear that type of crying in any other scenario.

Is this experience similar to anybody else on this sub?

I sorta feel that he is crying so much and tiring himself out, then going to sleep.  As appose to soothing himself to sleep, which I thought was suppose to happen.

He does sleep though, after a little while.  It has ranged from 5 minutes to 30 minutes.

Appreciate any response.

6am wake

9 to 10.30/11ish nap

2 to 3.30/4ish nap

7.15 to 7.30 bed

Yesterday we started our day at 4.50am. Moving bedtime earlier as a survival technique is fine, but it rarely seems to have an impact on early waking, e.g. last night she was in bed st 6.45 and was up at 5.20.

Naps are a mess too. After a few weeks of increasingly early mornings I knuckled down and started capping her naps at 1hr 30. This temporarily helped, but generally she's a beast if woken early, and I feel like that's because she needs the sleep. Right now however, naps are between 30 and 60 minutes. Goes down easily but can't stay asleep and I can't encourage her to lengthen them. I'm trying to stick to schedule as much as possible so this morning she had a 3.5 hr 1st wake window and still barely managed an hour.

Starting 2 weeks ago, he started pushing his wake time back. It’s been anywhere from 3 am-4:30, and he’s wide awake, doesn’t seem particularly hungry, just wants to be UP and playing but will inevitably be super cranky and want to go back down for a nap like an hour later... because he woke up too early.

6 month old CIO Question,sleeptrain,1,d27r8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/d27r8o/6_month_old_cio_question/,3,1568152017.0,"We just finished night 3 of sleep training extinction method with my 6.5M dtr and I have a question about night feeds. We are doing cry it out to try and eliminate wake ups in the middle of the night every 1-2 hours since object permanence at about 5.5M. My daughter is able to put herself to sleep independently when placed in the crib awake (no tears at all on nights 1-3 of ST). Our routine is pjs/diaper/sleep sack/bottle/rock and song/place in crib awake.

FEEDING:

PREVIOUSLY: We tried not to but were often ""boobing to sleep"" - 1st feed between 10PM - 1AM, second feed between 230 - 430AM, occasional third feed between 4 - 530AM. She ate a lot - we were in size-up overnight diapers that would be full by morning.

CURRENT PLAN: I am using the 5/3/3 rule for feeds and go in right away before she starts crying once we've passed the time threshold (first cutoff being midnight). If she's already crying before the time cutoff I wait for her to fall asleep and wake up again. I also thought this would correspond with Dr. Weissbluth's recommendation that some babies keep a midnight and 4AM feed until 9 months. I planned to try night weaning once the other MOTN wakings were eliminated.

CURRENT STATUS: All three nights she's started crying at around 10PM - one long bout of crying and then several shorter wakeups until midnight. She will eventually fall back asleep and wake up at 1245ish when I feed her. This pushes my next cutoff to 345/4. She, again, starts crying every night at around 3AM and will fall asleep again after 20-40mins and wake up past the cutoff between 4 and 5. Today she didn't fall asleep again after a 5AM feed (we left her fussing but not outright crying until 550 and then got her up).

Right now it feels worse than before - the longest stretch of sleep I've gotten for the past 3 nights is 2hrs despite being in bed for 9 and my daughter is so tired! She barely sleeps from 10-12 and from 3-4.  Total crying is decreasing but frequency of wakeups is more or less unchanged.

&#x200B;

QUESTION --

I can't tell if I just need to stick with what I'm doing now or modify my plan (e.g., add a dream feed, use a 4hr cutoff instead of 5/3/3). I also can't decide if it makes more sense to try and push her until morning instead of giving her the last feed at 4-5.

I would REALLY appreciate any input! Thank you so much in advance hive mind!

He flails his head around and acts ravenous at the beginning of a feed but he is hard to feed at night as he never fully wakes. I have to blow on his face and change his diaper to get him to drink more than 1oz, but he stirs hourly (after taking 20-30 minutes to eat and be upright) if I don’t make him eat more.

Still crying for sleep,sleeptrain,3,d1jcg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/d1jcg6/still_crying_for_sleep/,7,1568017450.0,"Hello, I’m back again. 

We sleep trained our girl using extinction in November when she was 6 months. Went fairly good, I suppose, I posted here for advice several times. Things were great for a while, then when she was 13 months we went on vacation. (She’s been on one nap since she turned a year.) She did great on vacation, fell right asleep no problem at nap and bed time. Woke up early each day, but it was fine. 

She was good for the two weeks after we got home from vacation, then she started crying again for naps and bedtime. Aaand she’s still crying for naps and bedtime, now she’s 16 months old. I don’t know how to help her fall asleep easier. Our bedtime and nap time routine has been the same since we started, is there maybe something that needs to change when they hit a certain age? 

Nap routine is: lullaby on white noise machine, diaper change, books, sing “You Are My Sunshine” a few times, nap time words, white noise and lights out. 

Bedtime routine is the same, but replace diaper change with bath and add in our good night words. 

I also start mentioning that’s it almost bedtime and saying “we’re going to take a bath, then put on jammies, read a book, sing some songs, and go to sleep.” She is fine through the whole routine, as well. It’s just when she gets put in her crib she starts crying. 

She cries anywhere from 10-45 minutes. And now she’s started adding “mama” in so it’s especially breaking my heart. She sleeps through the night and takes a 1.5-2 hour nap, and 90% of the time wakes up happy (the other times are because she’s pooped). I’ve tried a few minor adjustments (which is probably why there’s still crying after 3 months?), but I’ve tried to stick with them for a week or two to see if it helps (and not changing more than one think at a time), but here we are. The adjustments have been: singing the song while the white noise is on, singing holding her lovey, singing with the lights out. 

If you have any suggestions, please let me know! We’re at a loss over here. Maybe we just have an incredibly stubborn baby!

Edit: just to update, it seems the key was to start telling her it was nap or bedtime at least 20 minutes in advance of starting the routine, and continuing to tell her she was going to sleep in her crib every 5 minutes and during the routine. It’s working yesterday and today anyway! Probably something different tomorrow.","Still crying for sleepHello, I’m back again. 

We sleep trained our girl using extinction in November when she was 6 months. Went fairly good, I suppose, I posted here for advice several times. Things were great for a while, then when she was 13 months we went on vacation. (She’s been on one nap since she turned a year.) She did great on vacation, fell right asleep no problem at nap and bed time. Woke up early each day, but it was fine. 

She was good for the two weeks after we got home from vacation, then she started crying again for naps and bedtime. Aaand she’s still crying for naps and bedtime, now she’s 16 months old. I don’t know how to help her fall asleep easier. Our bedtime and nap time routine has been the same since we started, is there maybe something that needs to change when they hit a certain age? 

Nap routine is: lullaby on white noise machine, diaper change, books, sing “You Are My Sunshine” a few times, nap time words, white noise and lights out. 

Bedtime routine is the same, but replace diaper change with bath and add in our good night words. 

I also start mentioning that’s it almost bedtime and saying “we’re going to take a bath, then put on jammies, read a book, sing some songs, and go to sleep.” She is fine through the whole routine, as well. It’s just when she gets put in her crib she starts crying. 

She cries anywhere from 10-45 minutes. And now she’s started adding “mama” in so it’s especially breaking my heart. She sleeps through the night and takes a 1.5-2 hour nap, and 90% of the time wakes up happy (the other times are because she’s pooped). I’ve tried a few minor adjustments (which is probably why there’s still crying after 3 months?), but I’ve tried to stick with them for a week or two to see if it helps (and not changing more than one think at a time), but here we are. The adjustments have been: singing the song while the white noise is on, singing holding her lovey, singing with the lights out. 

If you have any suggestions, please let me know! We’re at a loss over here. Maybe we just have an incredibly stubborn baby!

Sleep-trained 6-month old is suddenly having trouble with self-soothing at night,sleeptrain,0,d1mjz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/d1mjz6/sleeptrained_6month_old_is_suddenly_having/,6,1568035390.0,"Our daughter has been sleep-trained using the CIO method for a couple of months now and she was doing very well up until a few days ago. Her naps are great but she's having problems self-soothing at bedtime. She still sleeps through the night (thank god) but we've had to resort to rocking/holding and waiting for her to be deeply asleep before putting her to bed. Her overnight sleep is from 8:00 PM to 7:30 AM. She takes about 3 hours worth of naps during the day, with wake times that are usually 2 hours long (sometimes shorter in the late afternoon). We're very consistent with her bedtime routine. We haven't changed anything but we did notice that the was whinier during the day that she started having trouble with self-soothing and she's been a bit whiny since.

Born with a medical condition that can affect sleep but right now his levels are within normal range and his behavior has drastically improved since his dosage was decreased. He’s never been a good sleeper, and hasn’t yet STTN. Both my husband and I are now back at work full-time and waking up multiple times with him every night is just not sustainable for either of us :(

We began sleep training/CIO at 5months and after a week he completely lost his voice so we paused for a week for him to get his voice back. Restarted training via CIO at 5.5mo. His first stretch he goes down between 6:45-7:15pm after a bath, change, feed, and lullaby; he understands its night time and doesnt protest, just rolls around for 5-10min finding a comfy spot then falls asleep. But then… he consistently wakes between 10-11pm, between 1-3am and between 4-5am. I’m not ready to night-wean so I feed him once usually between the 1-3am wakeup. We tried ferber and checking on him in intervals to soothe but that clearly riles him up more. Additionally, he recently started crawling and even standing in the crib during the night wakings. 

Daytime he takes between 2-3 naps: first around 9am, second around 1pm, 3rd around 430pm. But this is only if he gets help to fall asleep, he never naps on his own, always needs to walk around outside in the fresh air or nurse/bottle to nap.

We’re not looking to tackle naptime yet but do want to reduce night wakings to just one (continuing the one night feed). 

Any tips or advice would be GREATLY appreciated by these two sleepy parents.","6.5mo bebe has never STTN! Exhausted parents lookin for direction!Background: Baby boy is currently 6.5mo.

I'll be going back to work when he's 11 months, possibly 12 months if I decide to use my accrued leave in bulk (in the UK so yay for long mat leave!).

Baby is EBF and won't take a bottle (he used to, but we got out of the habit), however I don't want him to be using a bottle after he's a year old anyway, as per NHS guidelines. I'd like to wean him off BFing once I'm back at work. I won't be pumping, but am prepared to continue to feed in the evening and morning if he wants it. He has always been fed to sleep and then put down. Any attempt I have ever made to put him down awake results in screaming.

He used to be a ""good"" sleeper and stay in his cot quite happily till morning, but that changed around 6 months. Now he'll maybe stay down for between 20 mins and a couple of hours and doesn't want to stay in his cot. He will only really stay asleep in bed with me. I hate co-sleeping. It's lovely and natural and all that, but I don't get much sleep and it will be unsustainable when I go back to work and he goes to nursery.

I have never, ever been able to get him to go to sleep before 10pm and it's usually more like midnight. I have an evening routine that I've stuck to since we started weaning at 6 months which is dinner between 6 and 7, then bath, then story, then milk. He will sometimes nap for a bit, but won't fall into a deep sleep until much later in the evening. I either give up trying to get him to sleep or am trapped upstairs in my room all evening. I need him to be going to sleep no later than 8pm.

He only way he will nap is if I lie with him and feed him to sleep or if we go out for a walk, but the latter is never guaranteed to work. He will only ever nap for 20-40 minutes at a time. I ""force"" him to have a nap with me most mornings.

I have no idea how much of this is my fault or if I have a baby who just needs less sleep than others? I need to ""fix"" it before I go back to work otherwise I won't be able to function.

It went as expected. 
Bed time at 630 -hour of crying, fell asleep. Woke again in an hour and a half, only cried for 10 mins. 
Dreamfeed at 10, right back to sleep. 
Woke at 1 am and off and on snoozed and whined/cried a little until 2 when she got another dream feed. Slept until 4 which is her dreaded early wake up time every day no matter where she is sleeping. I went in to check on her and she was cold and hungry. So I felt bad and brought her into my bed to cuddle her and feed her, she fell back asleep in my bed and slept until 645. 

A few things: 
1) do you think I screwed up STing by bringing her into my bed at 4? I just felt so bad when I realized she was kinda cold. 

2) what do you guys dress your babies in, and how do you know they aren’t hot/cold? I had her in footie pjs because she tends to run warm so I had her ceiling fan on. I had turned it off at 2am dreamfeed so I was surprised that she felt cold. 

3)do you give them some sort of lovey or stuffy or something? She had a small stuffed fox but didn’t seem to care much about it but she seems like she really wants to snuggle up to something, she kept falling asleep pushed up against the railing/side of the crib. She is used to sleeping with me so it made me feel sad like she was trying to snuggle. 

4) nursing mamas, what do you do about your boobs? Do you get up and pump? Will they eventually regulate the supply? Everyone is all “it’s so wonderful to sleep through the night” but if your having to get up and pump anyway...it’s not really wonderful. That’s mainly why I’m keeping the dreamfeeds, I’d rather feed her than pump.

Our four month old we sometimes leave with my parents and he doesn’t get great naps with them, or we can’t put him down for his 5 o clock nap before his 7pm bedtime routine.

Whenever he misses his 5-530o  nap, we just wait to do the routine a little earlier around 645 (bath, feed, rock)  but hes over tired and sometimes a screaming session  happens or he goes down for a 30 mins then wakes up at 8 as if it’s a nap. 

In my opinion if he misses the nap at 5-530, we should start the bed time routine extra early like 545 and just break the routine. If he’s crazy tired at 545 maybe skip the bath and just focus on getting him to sleep as fast as possible.

My wife disagrees, she thinks we need to keep the schedule and putting him to bed extra early or skipping the bath is bad because he’ll wake up early or it breaks routine.

My opinion is do anything that keeps him from going to bed overtired. Make sure he goes to bed if he’s been up 1.5 hours no matter what. 

Thanks for your time and I would love to hear your thoughts or feedback from experience.","What to do when he misses nap before bed?Hey guys,

"6mo goes to sleep fine in evening, but still has night wakings crying for 20+ min after 8 nights of cry it out",sleeptrain,4,d0wgt7,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/d0wgt7/6mo_goes_to_sleep_fine_in_evening_but_still_has/,8,1567894418.0,"Our (almost) 6 month old didn’t have much trouble going down to sleep for the night before we started sleep training. We had been putting her down drowsy but awake for naps and bedtime already for quite a while. 

The main issue we wanted to combat with sleep training though was her night wakings. She consistently woke up screaming several times during the night, and would initially be calmed only by being held and rocked, but I gradually weaned her over about two weeks to only needing her pacifier put back in and for me to stand in her room quietly for at most a few minutes and she’d go back to sleep. She did have one feeding during the night and went back to sleep after that without complaint.

We started complete extinction for night wakings 8 nights ago with the following plan:

Bedtime routine starts about 5:30-5:45, baby is asleep by 6:15-6:45. Routine includes bath, nursing, book, sleep sack, put in crib with pacifier awake. We tried making bedtime a little later but she gives pretty clear drowsiness signals around 5:30 pretty much regardless of when she woke up from her last nap.

Any wakings between bedtime and midnight are ignored. 

The first waking after midnight, we feed her and then put her back in crib (sometimes still awake, sometimes she falls asleep first).

Any subsequent wakings after being fed, prior to 6am, are ignored.

Once she’s awake after 6am, we feed her and start the day.

Since the first night of sleep training with this plan, she has woken up in the 10pm-11:30pm range and cried for 5-20 minutes 6 out of 8 nights. This wakeup seems to be persistent. 

Additionally, two nights ago she woke up at 5am and screamed for 25 min, and last night she woke up at 5:20am and cried all the way until 6 when we finally went in and got her (she was unsurprisingly very unhappy). She used to have a wake up like this (more like 4:30am) prior to sleep training, but it seemed to have disappeared for the first 6 nights after we started.

Is this 5am crying spell the dreaded “extinction burst”? Should we let her wail until she ultimately goes back to sleep even if that goes past 6am? I’m concerned that we reinforced the behavior by getting her and nursing her after 40 min of crying but not sure what else to do as it was 6am already and she is accustomed to eating at that time. The last two nights before these 5am wake ups happened her night feeding was at 2 or 3am and she slept soundly until 6:45, then woke up happy and cooing. But the past two nights she ate just after midnight. Maybe those midnight wakings are actually related to the 11pm one and aren’t for food, and we should ignore and not feed her until she cries after 2? Very confusing how to deal with cry it out rules when the baby still has a night feeding! 

For what it’s worth she has 3 decent naps per day, generally the last one is the longest at about 1.5-2 hours from 2-4pm or so, but her nap timing isn’t very consistent (we mostly watch her cues to avoid letting her get overtired - her awake windows can range from an hour and 15 min to almost 3 hours). We’ve hardly left the house the past two weeks to ensure she gets all her naps in her crib. 

She is in the 97th percentile for weight and honestly likely doesn’t need a night feed at all but literature indicates those don’t go away until 9 months and we didn’t want to tackle both night weaning and non-feeding night wakings simultaneously, but maybe we should??

He has been sleeping through the night from 6:30 pm to 5:30/6:00 am since just shy of 7 months, which a few hiccups here and there that lead to some bad nights (teething, sleep regression, vacation). Even with the small blips of poor sleep or needing a night feeding, he’s always gone back to sleeping through the night.. until now.

The past two weeks have been so awful. He still goes to sleep without our help, but he has been waking up at least once in the night and not calming down until given a bottle. Then, he tries to wake up for the day around 4:30 am, so I end up holding/rocking him to get him to keep sleeping until 6:00 am. 

Tonight has been an especially bad night, with his first wake up at 10:00pm at which time I gave him a bottle. Woke up at 1:30, settled on his own after about15 min but then woke up again at 2;00 and wouldn’t settle, so i went and rubbed his back until he fell back asleep. He woke up again at 2:50 and wouldn’t even settle with backrubs, so I offered another bottle, which he rejected. So now I’m currently holding/rocking him. If I want him to get a reasonable amount of sleep, that means I’ll be doing this for over three more hours until 6:00 am. 

A lot of big changes are going on for him, and I have not simply let him cry it out because I feel badly that these changes may be causing the poor sleep:

- He started daycare on 8/26 which threw off naps and eating 
- He is currently getting his two upper central incisors
- He is learning how to walk
- He’s dealing with separation anxiety

I am at my wits end, though. I don’t even know where to start. If anyone can provide insight or advice, it would be extremely appreciated.","Previously incredible sleeper now terrible at 11.5 months.

She cried for about 45 minutes the first two nights, then had two good nights (no crying at all!) Then she cried for anywhere from 15-45 minutes for a few nights, then had a couple good nights again. Ad nauseum. She's on her fourth night in a row again of crying anywhere from 15-45 minutes after being put down before going to sleep.

Once she's asleep, she's good until about 2:30-3:00 when she wakes to nurse. If she was overtired at bedtime she'll wake early at 5:30 and need to be nursed down, otherwise she stays down until 6:30-7:00.

On weekends I try to stick to 2-2.25 hr windows.

Previous bouts I just assumed were extinction bursts, but this time around is an angrier/more frantic cry and she's started crying during our bedtime routine. Maybe separation anxiety? I don't know. I've tried going in to soothe once or twice but it just works her up more. Should I go back to rocking to sleep (and likely multiple wakings)? What is even happening?

Hi all, is there anything to be done to help reduce baby’s jerking her arms and legs as she’s about to fall asleep/sleeping.

A bit more details: I don’t think they are quite the same as Moro reflex (or idk, maybe they are), more like actions of a baby realizing that she’s falling asleep and wanting to fight it, or perhaps her legs and arms feel awkward in the empty space of the pack n play as opposed to when being held tight in arms. For example, she would pull both legs up and then as they are slowly lowering she would suddenly pull them up again, or she would jerk her arm from by her face, then grab her sleep sack, jerk again and move it back to by her face.

Context: 3.5m old, has been off the swaddle for about 2 weeks because she’s learned to roll over. She used to do 2-4 hour stretches before midnight and 45-minute stretches in the pack n play when swaddled, but since the swaddle came off, she’s been in arms/co-sleeping for all naps and nighttime sleep. I tried putting her down, sitting next to her to shush and was able to get her to fall asleep in the pack n play today (she fussed and tossed and turned a bit, but did not cry). However, I saw her jolting arms and legs as mentioned above. She slept quietly for 10 minutes and then jolted herself awake with her moving  limbs. Wondering jf anyone have any information to share about this.

13 month old shrieking in her crib,sleeptrain,2,d0ikdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/d0ikdb/13_month_old_shrieking_in_her_crib/,4,1567814326.0,"This was just one night so maybe it's just something like teething or temporary discomfort rather than a pattern, but wanted to ask for general advice on what to do in the future.

Our 13 month old is/was mostly sleep trained, I feel.  Her bedtime is around 8pm and while she'll occasionally sleep through the night, she usually wakes up sometime between 1-3am, standing up in her crib crying like she's in distress.  Normally giving her a bottle of milk is enough to get her to calm down and go right back to sleep.  But last night she woke up around 11pm, had just 2oz of milk, was clearly sleepy as she was falling asleep in my arms while flopping around trying to get comfortable, but would scream and shriek when she realized we were carrying her back into her room OR that she had already been put back into her crib.  After ruling out wet/dirty diaper, hunger, and giving her some tylenol for teething, we tried letting her CIO for 5-10 minutes.  Her crying would sort of fade away, then she'd start wailing again.  In the end, she slept with us in our bed on top of our sheets and was asleep until maybe 6am when she decided she was up for the day.

We don't want her to get used to sleeping in bed with us, but at the same time we didn't want her to get distressed and get *no* sleep.

What should we do in the future?  We currently have a white noise machine and an amber nightlight in her room.  Should we take the nightlight out?  I read that if a baby is having trouble sleeping we can try making the room as dark as possible, but she doesn't typically have trouble sleeping with sounds or lights so long as it's not a sudden loud noise.  The night before she slept from 8pm-8am with a brief wake-up  middle of the night for milk.  She did have a huge poop this morning so it's possible she might have just been uncomfortable from being stopped up overnight.","13 month old shrieking in her cribThis was just one night so maybe it's just something like teething or temporary discomfort rather than a pattern, but wanted to ask for general advice on what to do in the future.

Normally giving her a bottle of milk is enough to get her to calm down and go right back to sleep.  But last night she woke up around 11pm, had just 2oz of milk, was clearly sleepy as she was falling asleep in my arms while flopping around trying to get comfortable, but would scream and shriek when she realized we were carrying her back into her room OR that she had already been put back into her crib.  After ruling out wet/dirty diaper, hunger, and giving her some tylenol for teething, we tried letting her CIO for 5-10 minutes.  Her crying would sort of fade away, then she'd start wailing again.  In the end, she slept with us in our bed on top of our sheets and was asleep until maybe 6am when she decided she was up for the day.

We don't want her to get used to sleeping in bed with us, but at the same time we didn't want her to get distressed and get *no* sleep.

What should we do in the future?  We currently have a white noise machine and an amber nightlight in her room.  Should we take the nightlight out?  I read that if a baby is having trouble sleeping we can try making the room as dark as possible, but she doesn't typically have trouble sleeping with sounds or lights so long as it's not a sudden loud noise.  The night before she slept from 8pm-8am with a brief wake-up  middle of the night for milk.  She did have a huge poop this morning so it's possible she might have just been uncomfortable from being stopped up overnight."

Early wakeups,sleeptrain,1,d005li,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/d005li/early_wakeups/,0,1567715333.0,"Hello all!

My almost 16 month old has recently started sleeping through the night but wakes up about an hour early and makes noise, not full on crying, for a couple minutes about every 10-15 minutes until I finally go get her at 7am. 

She goes to bed at 7pm, and naps at 10am (30-60min) and 2pm(60-90min). She was breastfed until about 2 weeks ago, when I got the go ahead from the pediatrician to wean her. Before this she had been waking around 3 every night to eat, and since she was 11weeks premature and still small for her age, the Dr wanted me to keep feeding her on demand. She started sleeping til 5 or 6, and a few times til 7, without waking me for milk, so the Dr agreed she could probably sleep through the night on her own, and just have cow's milk if she woke.

My concern is this: should I still be giving her her sippy cup at 6 if she wakes up, or is it okay to leave her til 7 so hopefully she gets used to sleeping or staying in bed til then? I'm afraid going to her will encourage her to keep waking up early.


Edited to add:
Her bedtime routine is bath (every other night), diaper/pajamas, books in the recliner with mom or dad while drinking her sippy cup. Then she helps us turn off the lights (bedroom light is off for the bedtime routine, just the hall light so it's not harsh), and then hand her a pacifier and stuffed animal, then into the pack n play. 
Her room has blackout curtains and a noise machine. Her pack n play also has a cover on it, like a black fabric elastic thing but we leave the top open. 
As a night light we leave her closet light on but the door closed, so it's still really dark in there. 

She goes to bed without crying at night, and for naps she usually whines for a minute or two but is usually laying down quiet by the time I get downstairs from laying her down.

How do you remove sleep props (3 month old),sleeptrain,6,czuftb,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/czuftb/how_do_you_remove_sleep_props_3_month_old/,22,1567677661.0,"My husband and I saw into our future tonight, and it looks bleak for us.

Really need help,sleeptrain,6,czqupo,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/czqupo/really_need_help/,8,1567660234.0,"Hey, all. I really need some advice. I’m just going to go overboard with the details and hope someone feels generous and wants to help me out. 

I read Precious Little Sleep and have been following her advice, but some of it is a little difficult to follow 100% given the fact we have our child in daycare during the day. Schedules and wake times are a big deal w/ PLS, and with daycare, it’s just impossible to control his schedule completely. 

My 9.5 month old is still waking up multiple times a night. He goes to sleep completely independently, finishes eating 30 min before putting him down, we have a routine, he’s wide awake when I put him down, etc. Bedtime is thankfully not an issue at all anymore. It’s what comes later. He wakes up several times a night, wanting to nurse. It used to be every hour before we started training, so I was really excited about the improvement, but it’s been almost a month since we decided to re-train (vacation screwed us up) and he still wakes up at least 3 times a night. 

We have been trying to follow the PLS guideline of 5 hours after bedtime before nursing, then 3 hours between feedings. So our night usually looks like this:

6:30 all eating done. Then bath, pajamas, books, song, bed. 

7:00 in bed. Falls asleep within a few minutes. 

9:00 sometimes wakes up for a few minutes and cries a few times, usually goes back down within 5 min. I don’t go in. 

11:00 almost every night, without fail, he wakes up and cries around 11:00 or 11:30. This one isn’t over quickly. It can last 10 min or 30 min of ramping up and winding down. I don’t go in because it’s only been 4 or 4.5 hours since bedtime, and according to PLS, going in this early can re-establish his nursing to sleep association. 

12:00-12:30 sometime in this timeframe, he wakes up and I feed him. Keep in mind, it’s only been like an hour since the last time he woke up (when I didn’t feed). I keep waiting for him to drop the 11:00 wakeup because he isn’t getting fed, but nope. And the fact that he’s waking again another hour later... I’m worried he’s actually hungry at 11. But I’m afraid to undo any progress we’ve made since he SHOULD be able to sleep the whole night without waking to eat. 

3:00-3:30 another wakeup. It’s been 3 hours so I nurse and he falls asleep. 

4:30 or 5:00 wakes again. I usually treat this like a snooze button feed, even though it hasn’t been 3 hours, and that feed gets me an extra hour before he’s up for the day at 6:00 or 6:30. 

His naps are a mess. He’s at daycare and he sleeps terribly there. Some days he sleeps maybe 60-90 min total, other days it’s 30 min total. He has major FOMO. They have rules about not letting the babies cry longer than 5 min in a crib, so he’s rocked to sleep most of the time. I would stress about this, except it’s basically out of my control and I’ve read a lot of comments from people about how daycare sleep and night sleep are so different that this shouldn’t really matter. It seems more important that he get ENOUGH sleep so he’s not overtired at night. ...Right? So I should be ok with them rocking? 

I pick him up at 4:15 from daycare and he sleeps the 15 min drive home. Some days I’ve woken him up right when we get home, so he has enough wake time before putting him to bed, and other days I’ve worried about how tired he must be and I’ve let him sleep longer, like an hour. I’m not sure I’ve seen a significant difference yet between these two methods. Lately I’ve been so focused on wake time before bedtime (because bedtime used to be so rough), so I haven’t let him sleep longer than that 15 min in a while. 

So, I have so many questions. 

Am I totally doomed to have night wakings until he sleeps better at daycare (if that EVER happens)? Did anyone else go through this? When he’s one, he goes into a class where they all take one nap, and I’m hoping maybe that will go better... he has serious FOMO. Plus it’s not quiet or dark enough there with the babies all being on their own schedules. 

Should I ask them not to rock him for naps? I’m not sure he’d sleep at all then... with them not letting them cry much in the crib. 

Assuming I can’t keep him awake on the drive home (I’ve tried and so far he falls asleep no matter what I do), should I wake him up the second we get home? Or let him catch up on some sleep on the days he only sleeps 30 min at daycare? 

Should I nurse when he wakes at 11 or 11:30? 

Should I not be nursing to sleep at all during the night? Supposedly it’s ok (after 5 hours) and won’t screw up bedtime associations...  and so far it hasn’t, but is it just contributing to the night wakings? He does seem to eat a full amount when he wakes up. 

Should I just let him cry all night long and not feed him at all? Or is that just cruel? I don’t even know if I could do that (emotionally), but I wonder if going in there - even though I’m spacing it out - is prolonging this whole thing. 

What else am I doing wrong?? The more I listen to him cry, it’s just killing me. I’m so tired but I’m also so worried I’m torturing him emotionally because I can’t seem to get this right. And I’m worried he’s sleep deprived overall. 

I have mastitis right now, so I’m extra annoyed and tired and just at my wit’s end and I’m hoping someone can help me figure some things out. I’m planning to wean at a year and I’m wondering if that’s going to help or hurt...?

Night one went PRETTY good!

We put him down at 7 and went through the 3 minute check, 5 minute check, and two ten minutes. He fell asleep after the second ten minute.

Then he did not wake up until 115!! Which is awesome because we’d been dealing with a very obnoxious 10 or 11 pm wake up that would bug us right after we fell asleep. We did the 3 min, 5 min, and he was asleep three minutes after the 5 min check 

Then he woke up at 325 and fell asleep 1 min after the 3 min check 

Now it’s 6 and I’m feeding him :) he slept through his 430 am feed and I’m not sure if he’s up for the day or will go back down

I’m super happy with this :) he calmed himself down wayyyy sooner than I thought each time. I really thought each night wake up would be hours. Hopefully the next few nights go this way!"

He sleeps pretty well and goes back to sleep if he wakes up in the middle of the night (although he only wakes up like once sometimes to eat before then sleeping like 7 hours).

Thing is, we generally sort of bounce him a little on our shoulder before putting him to bed (to get him drowsy). Same for naps. We don't do it until he goes to sleep (although sometimes he falls asleep by then) but he will still typically wake up with his eyes open for a second before closing them and going to sleep (when we place him on his crib mattress)

Is this bad to do? I know rocking to sleep is bad.....but is bouncing them to calm them down for the night bad? Especially if he's staying asleep (his naps have been a little thrown off this week due to teething but otherwise his nighttime sleep has been good)

One weird thing he does i've noticed, is like every other day or so he'll wake up after an hour at night and cry for like 5 minutes and then go back to sleep (he's done this for the past month or so). Yesterday was especially bad and I had to go calm him down the first time but after that he was fine (im guessing maybe just due to the teething). Any ideas on that?

MIND BLOWN!,sleeptrain,81,cy3no8,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/cy3no8/mind_blown/,8,1567328633.0,"Y’all! I have been preparing for this moment for months. I’ve read books (Precious Little Sleep & Sleep Easy Solutions) and almost every post on this subreddit. 

Tonight was our first night putting our nearly 8 month old DD in her crib to sleep. For the past 5 months we have been bed sharing and nursing throughout the night. She had always been nursed to sleep, naps and bedtime. She started crawling at 6 months and so I have been chained to her at bedtime and nap time for her safety and it needed to end. Plus, I wanted anyone other than Mommy put her to bed, freeing up the possibility for Mommy to do adult things like  take a shower, go out with the girls or the husband. The possibilities are endless! 

So we did our normal routine- dinner + nurse, bath, bottle, bed- but this time she went in her crib. We said our sweet things and turned on the Hatch Nursery sound + light machine (tv static + red light) and walked out. 

She was standing in her crib and screaming before we could shut the door. I wrote down the time- 8:27pm- and starting waiting til the first check in 5 minutes later. At 3 minutes there were some breaks in the cries, but she’s still standing. Then she STOPS crying at FOUR minutes. I see her head wobbling. Then her butt hits the crib and she just flops over onto her stomach and goes to sleep! WHAT?!?! 

She squirmed around a little, her usual amount, to get to her sweet spot. But y’all. She is still asleep almost 30 minutes later. 

I was fully prepared to cry and fight her alllll night long thinking her nurse to sleep association and co-sleeping habit was too strong. Well, thankfully I was WRONG! SHE DID IT! WE DID IT! Now, I assume we’ll hit some rough patches and I’m still nervous about when she wakes up to eat, but this is so mind blowing I had to share. 

I hope this gives you the strength to jump in knowing that you can’t predict what will happen, and maybe YOUR mind will be blown too! 

Gah, I am just such a proud mama right now! That said, I’m gonna go enjoy a nice bath! 🧖🏻‍♀️

TLDR: 8 month old previously nursed to sleep in a bed sharing situation fell asleep in her crib the first night in 4 minutes!!!!

UPDATE: She has slept THROUGH the entire night the last two night. Yesterday’s naps were literally no problem, she went right down and I had to wake her up from both- 2.5 hours and 1.5 hours each. Today’s first nap, however... I’m going on the 20 minute interval now. At 5 minutes it was the soothing talk, at 10 I changed her diaper and gave her a 2ox bottle. Since she sleeping through the night I thought she might be hungry, no talking. She drank the whole bottle and was comfort nursing and passing out on it so I put her back in the crib for the 15 minute interval, still crying. 50 minutes later she’s asleep, sitting up, with her face between the rails, but asleep, finally. We’re definitely figuring it out together but sleeping through the night is a miracle. And I’ve taken the whole week off to get this down pat, though I realize we’ll always be learning and modifying. So much for perfect, but how boring is that 🤪","MIND BLOWN!Y’all! I have been preparing for this moment for months. I’ve read books (Precious Little Sleep & Sleep Easy Solutions) and almost every post on this subreddit. 

Tonight was our first night putting our nearly 8 month old DD in her crib to sleep. For the past 5 months we have been bed sharing and nursing throughout the night. She had always been nursed to sleep, naps and bedtime. She started crawling at 6 months and so I have been chained to her at bedtime and nap time for her safety and it needed to end. Plus, I wanted anyone other than Mommy put her to bed, freeing up the possibility for Mommy to do adult things like  take a shower, go out with the girls or the husband. The possibilities are endless! 

So we did our normal routine- dinner + nurse, bath, bottle, bed- but this time she went in her crib. We said our sweet things and turned on the Hatch Nursery sound + light machine (tv static + red light) and walked out. 

She was standing in her crib and screaming before we could shut the door. I wrote down the time- 8:27pm- and starting waiting til the first check in 5 minutes later. At 3 minutes there were some breaks in the cries, but she’s still standing. Then she STOPS crying at FOUR minutes. I see her head wobbling. Then her butt hits the crib and she just flops over onto her stomach and goes to sleep! WHAT?!?!

Starting Ferber—two questions,sleeptrain,1,cy8x52,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/cy8x52/starting_ferbertwo_questions/,4,1567366782.0,"Hello! We’re gonna start Ferber with my almost 6 month old Tuesday when we get back from visiting my in-laws. 

Right now our baby goes down at 730, wakes up at 10 crying, sometimes at 2 crying, at 5 for a feeding, and then sleeps till 7. I only feed him at 5 when he’s crying—the other times we pat his butt until he falls back to sleep. He goes to sleep with a bottle, and then my husband puts him in the crib and pats him to sleep. The patting is the main sleep association we need to break. He needs it to fall back to sleep when he gets up and it’s getting worse and worse (the 2 am thing is recent, used to be pats before bed, at 10 and that was it)

1) I’m wondering if I have to eliminate the 5 am feed or if it’s ok to keep it once he’s sleep trained. I’m back to work part time, so sometimes it’s one of the few times I can still nurse him in the day, so I look forward to it. Also I think it helps him sleep in so late, which I really enjoy. Also at 5 I don’t need to pat him to sleep. After the nursing session I put him in the crib and he rolls over and falls asleep on his own

2) do we have to do Ferber for naps too? My baby’s a very good napper and does about 9-11 and then 1-3, but I nurse him to sleep for naps and sometimes need to also pat him to sleep. I don’t mind nursing him to sleep, and I kinda don’t wanna mess with my awesome naps. Also we have cobbled together childcare from family and a babysitter and I think it’d be hard to get everyone on the same page","Starting Ferber—two questionsHello!

She was 2 weeks overdue!). She's always been very ""aware"" but mostly a good sleeper if I catch her before she's overtired. We've been bedsharing since she was about 2 weeks old bc PPA and I thought she would stop breathing if she wasn't right next to me all night. For naps I'll lay next to her and nurse her to sleep. That was working fine until a few weeks ago, when I started to get the impression that my being there is actually just keeping her up longer. She kicks her little legs and paws at me while she's nursing, forces herself to keep her eyes open bc I think she still wants to hang out. It's worst at bedtime, when she knows the ""big sleep"" is coming and she doesn't want to leave the party yet. Last night she was tired enough to go down pretty easily, but woke an hour later and no amount of calm laying and nursing put her back to sleep. So, knowing she was tired, I put her in her pack n play (also in my bedroom- we only have the one) with her favorite little stuffy and left the room. She was quiet for a little while, started crying/fussing for about 10 minutes but never went full boar, and then stopped. I had to peek my head in just to make sure she was okay! She was awake but on her tummy, just looking around calmly. Left and when I checked back maybe 15 minutes later she was asleep! But face-down, which scared me so I walked over to make sure she was okay which woke her up crying. Picked up, nursed, same routine where she didn't want to go back to sleep, so I put her back in pack n play... Heard maybe 2 minutes of fussing that time and then silence. Heard her wake up maybe 1/2 an hour later, fussed just a bit and went back to sleep. Didn't go back in until I was ready for bed and she was sleeping, but woke crying when I entered the room. At that point I just took her out and we both fell asleep in my bed.

Since Monday night,  he has been walking up sometime between 10:30-11pm. When it first started we went to him because it was so unusual for him to wake up.

'screwed up' by going in at all, so we would have to sleep train again the next day. But then the next day he cried frantically for 30 minutes and I went in, because I got concerned due to it being so unlike him. 

He got his MMR vaccine Wednesday, so last night i went to him because he was running a fever. I ended up staying up with him until 2am. At one point I just fully got up with him because his eyes were wide open  and my hands had gone numb from all the rocking/bouncing (my carpel tunnel is one of the reasons we sleep trained to begin with). 

Well now its Thursday night and you guessed it he woke up at 11pm. He is totally beyond frantic so we decided to send dad in. Well I am typing this as he cries 20 minutes later. Still frantic crying.

We've been away staying with relatives for 3 weeks and I've gradually slipped back into feeding her to sleep. Shes also learnt to crawl while we've been away.

Now we're back home, sleep is terrible. Shes waking every 45 minutes. If she doesn't go to sleep immediately when I put her down in the cot, she'll start crying/screaming, crawling round the cot and hitting the bars with her head.

I'm just about managing to get 20 minutes of sleep here and there between wakeups, but I'm back at work after my maternity leave next week (I'm in the UK) and I dont think I'm going to manage on a couple of hours sleep each night.

We've been away staying with relatives for 3 weeks and I've gradually slipped back into feeding her to sleep. Shes also learnt to crawl while we've been away.

Now we're back home, sleep is terrible. Shes waking every 45 minutes. If she doesn't go to sleep immediately when I put her down in the cot, she'll start crying/screaming, crawling round the cot and hitting the bars with her head.

I'm just about managing to get 20 minutes of sleep here and there between wakeups, but I'm back at work after my maternity leave next week (I'm in the UK) and I dont think I'm going to manage on a couple of hours sleep each night.

Weird Naps After Vacation + Night Wakeups = I don't know what the hell I'm doing,sleeptrain,2,cx4qdv,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/cx4qdv/weird_naps_after_vacation_night_wakeups_i_dont/,1,1567131737.0,"I'm back \*sigh\*

Baby Girl is now 10 months old and after a long and horrible spring of screaming and despair, things were going okay for a while--going to sleep with no fuss regardless of who put her down, lots of wake-ups but good naps, even a stretch where she was napping well AND sleeping 6-9 hours at a time!--and then she started to wake up more often, back to 3-4 times a night. I didn't sweat it because we were about to go on vacation for 3 weeks (West Coast to East Coast) and I figured she'd get all screwed up anyway and we'd just fix it when we got back. We had a great time, but it was miserably hot and humid for days at a time, I had to sleep in the room with her, AND she got roseola, so sleep was a mess. At least she took good naps!

Now that we've back for a week and she's finished cutting a tooth (argh), we're seeing some improvement in nighttime sleep. She fusses a little when we put her down and wakes up a few hours later, but she seems to be able to soothe herself. Then she wakes up again around 2 and I nurse her, then maybe once or twice more but I don't go in, and she's up for the day between 6:15 and 6:30 (full schedule below). But her naps are getting WEIRD. Of course she took some huge long ones while she was catching up on sleep and getting the tooth, but yesterday and today she's woken up from her morning nap after 25-30 minutes and cries until I go in and hold/nurse her for a few minutes. When I put her back down she cries again for a while and then falls asleep. I keep thinking she'll make it up by taking a longer afternoon nap, but yesterday the same thing happened and the day before she just slept 30 minutes and was done. Today she was up after 25 minutes, so I went in, and she's down again for 30 and counting. What's going on?

I guess I can live with the short naps if she starts sleeping better at night, but I really need the time during the day to work (big brother doesn't get to go to preschool if I can't do my freelance stuff to pay the bill) and do other stuff and get a break. She's a much clingier, fussier child than her brother: only my husband and I can hold her (or, after 3 weeks of constant interaction, my mother, but only if I'm not around, and she's not local), so it's hard to get anything done or have someone help me with her. And she's very stubborn. We tried Ferber when she was 4 months and it was terrible, then went to CIO and it was worse for a while. I still feel awful about it all. I want to night wean but we tried earlier this summer and it kind of worked, but the first night she cried for 3 hours. It was hell.

I have to drop all the nurse-to-sleep associations, don't I? We're going to start that tonight now that we're over the roseola and the jet lag and the tooth (although I suspect another one is imminent), by nursing before her bath, then having my husband start putting her down over the weekend. I use Huckleberry to determine the best naptime, but they're all over the place and I'm really bad at getting on a consistent schedule. Here's a rough version:

Anywhere between 6 and 7: Wake up  
Anywhere between 9:30 and 10:30 (depending on wake time) Nap 1  
Anywhere between 2:30 and 3:30 (depending on Nap 1): Nap 2  
Anywhere between 7:30 and 8: Bedtime

Bedtime routine is bath (only 3x/week), then pjs, story, hugs from Daddy and big brother, and nursing/cuddles (I know the nursing has to happen earlier or not at all). White noise for naps and night because the house is a smallish ranch. 

I'd like to move bedtime to 7:30, especially since Big Brother (4.5yrs) doesn't always nap anymore, but it's hard to deal with two kids in the evenings and I never seem to get dinner on the table before 6:30. I'm also wondering if her wake times are too short or long. Her average wake time is 3h15, which seems right on target but that includes a lot of stretches that were much too long. I know 2 days isn't a very big sample size, but I've tried to adhere to Huckleberry's recommendations today and yesterday and that's when the trouble started, so maybe it's too short? Her afternoon naps can often stretch until 5 or later, which I know is really bad, but I hate waking sleeping babies, especially ones who have so much trouble falling asleep!

Despite the fact that this is not my first rodeo I cannot seem to get this right. Any advice or help would be much appreciated! It's been 6 months of failure and anguish and guilt and worry, and I just want everyone to get the sleep they need.","Weird Naps After Vacation + Night Wakeups = I don't know what the hell I'm doingI'm back \*sigh\*

We also seemed to remedy her early waking issues by making her room darker (plus some schedule tweaks). She currently goes down for her first nap and her bedtime fairly easily, but she will not go down for her second nap and I have no idea why or what to do to fix it.

I am open to **any** and **all** advice on what might work to fix this. 

This is roughly her daily schedule of sleep (or it was before the second nap mayhem) :

6a-7a: wake up. Gets bottle right away, breakfast about 1.5 hrs after being up.

9a-10a: Nap 1. It is always 3 hours after she wakes up, so I have to vary it based on her wake time. She usually sleeps for 1hr 10mins (used to be 1hr 20mins).

1:30p-3p: Nap 2. This has varied, because it depends on when she goes down for nap 1... I've tried playing around with the wake time here, usually between 3-3.5hrs, but I can't find a sweet spot. She used to go down without an issue and sleep for about an hour to 1hr 20mins. 

6:40p-7:15p: Bedtime. I try to make the wake window here about 3hr 40min. Too much longer or shorter and it doesn't seem as successful. Most nights she goes down fine. Sleeps between 10.5-12 hours (not sure why this varies).

For her second nap, she has started to have FULL BLOWN meltdowns. I'm talking hysterical tears while standing in her crib. I've succumbed the past few days and just held her for the nap, because even though I know this could ""sabotage"" my sleep training efforts, I am not really prepared to have her skip the nap, or not get sleep, because it will mess up her bedtime and I've worked so hard to get her bedtime better.

Changes in sleep due to day care start - advice please,sleeptrain,3,cwsxii,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/cwsxii/changes_in_sleep_due_to_day_care_start_advice/,5,1567064925.0,"I successfully trained by 9 month (almost ten month) baby at 6 months. I found all the advice on experience on this subreddit really helpful. After two bad nights, followed by 2-3 weeks where she slowly improved, she was fully sleep trained and would put herself the sleep for all naps/bed, and sleep through the night. Normal schedule:

* 6.30-45am wake up
* 9-10am first nap (2.5 hour wake time)
* 1.15-3.15pm second nap (3.25 hour wake time, sometimes this is slightly earlier or later)
* 7pm bed (3.75 hour wake time)

She has had two day care orientations (I'm in Australia). The first was only two hours, and then on Tuesday I left her for four hours - 8am-12noon. She didn't sleep a minute, refused her bottle (has had no problem in the past) and cried a lot. I'm sort of OK with this, I know its hard and she'll get there. We have two more orientations before I go back to work next week.

But my problem is that since I picked her up on Tuesday, she has not been able to put herself to sleep. She had either not napped, been rocked/fed to sleep or cried for a long time. Last night:

* Put her down at 6pm as she refused her afternoon nap. Cried for 45 mins before sleeping
* Woke at 8pm and cried for another 30 mins before sleeping
* Woke at 10pm and cried for 60 minutes before I went in and settled her. This took me another one hour. Even on the first night of sleep training, she only cried for 45 minutes and then slept through.

So my question is: do I just rock/feed her to sleep while she settles in at day care? Or continued trying to let her cry it out? I wary of getting her into a rocking habit, as they probably won't have time to do this at day care, but she will find it much harder to settle there the more tired she is. What to do???

For whats it worth, this has convinced me on the benefits of sleep training. She has been so cranky and overtired and a much less happy baby.

She is now about to be 10MO and she is a horrible sleeper. I haven't slept for more than 3 hours at a time through the night since she was about 2MO.

I ended up toughing it out and continued with CIO as that is what we did with my DS when he was 6MO and it worked great. Heres the problem, she puts herself to sleep no problem, but will not stay asleep for longer than 3 hours. We room share as our apartment only has 2 bedrooms and our DS (2yo) sleeps in the other bedroom. I have tried (what feels like) everything to ignore her when she wakes up, I give her a soother and rub her back, I have clipped on a blanket to the side of her crib so she cant see me. We have even brought her crib out to our family room thinking if that might help.  But she will not go back to sleep unless I nurse her. I guess the way I see it is, Id rather get up and feed her for 10 minutes than both my husband and I laying awake listening to her cry for who know how long. Which I'm sure is why I'm having this problem lol. But I am defeated and running on fumes. I need sleep!

Here is a run down of her sleep schedule

I have been putting her to bed between 630/7 pm, I will feed her and put her into her crib and she usually will just roll over and go to sleep. From there she will wake every 2-3 hours, and wakes up around 6 for the day. When she wakes up she is still tired (whiney and rubbing her eyes) but will not go back to sleep. I will usually put her down for a nap around 830/9 and she will sleep for 30-40 minutes. She will then go for a nap at the same time as her brother around 12 and will sleep for 60-90 minutes. She is usually fine until bed time, but there have been a few times that I have put her down for a short nap around 4 if she is unbearable.

My baby is 7 months. Our bedtime routine is bath, book, bottle. She falls asleep on my arm but opens her eyes when I transfer her. She usually wakes up once around 2-4 to eat but past few days have been sleeping 8-7 no wakeups.

In the daytime, her waketime is about 2-2.5 hrs and lately she won’t go to sleep without a bottle of milk(2 oz). I try to extend her waketime but she’s actually fussy around the 2 hr mark.

Our schedule is like this:

7:30 wake, eat

9:30 eat 2oz, fall asleep on arm, transfer and nap

11:30 wake, eat

1:00 eat 2 oz, fall asleep on arm, transfer and nap

2:00 wake eat

4:30 rock to nap, very fussy 

5:00 wake eat

7:30 bath, book, eat, fall asleep on arm, transfer

She always seems overtired at bedtime. Past couple of days she has been waking up at 8pm and 9pm and has been inconsolable and impossible to put down. She doesn’t want her pacifier or milk or rocking. She’s tired but her eyes are wide open and wants to play. After an hour of rocking, pacifier, milk combination she finally goes to sleep for the night 8-7 or 9-7:30.

Do I have a feeding association problem?or wake time problem? Any advice?","Can’t figure this sleep thing out!Hoping you guys can help me out here.

Retraining of naps after travel or is a schedule change needed?,sleeptrain,2,cwqui2,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/cwqui2/retraining_of_naps_after_travel_or_is_a_schedule/,3,1567055075.0,"We were just away for a week with our almost 11 month old. She was an amazing napper and a good sleeper up until a week before we traveled (when she got her first two teeth). We tried to stick to the schedule as much as we could while we were away but some of the naps were crap 15-20 minute car naps, the place and bed were different, etc... So sleep wasn't perfect but we rolled with the 4:30am wake ups and the one, two (normal) or three nap days.

Now that we are home, she is fighting the naps hard and they are shorter. Nights are still fine and the same. So I'm just looking for some feedback from the community if this is retraining after travel thing or a required schedule change thing (she's a more grown up baby over the last month too - started crawling, sitting up from her tummy, mimicking a ton, picking more food up to eat, eating more solids...).

Schedule (normal schedule before travel within 15-30min):
6:00am awake
9-10:30am first nap (3 hour awake time goal)
2-3:30pm second nap (3.5 hour awake time goal)
7:30pm bed (3.5-4 hour awake time goal)

She would fall asleep within 10 minutes of babbling to herself in her crib. We did Ferber successfully for nights at 6.5 months and for naps at 8 months.

It usually starts with a warm bath and then putting her Nested Bean Zen Sack(we started using since we wean her off from swaddling around 3 months) on and offering her bottle. I give her pumped breastmilk with the bottle and also some supplementing with formula. She usually eats around 5 oz. she usually sleeps in her crib which is next to our bed. Room is completely dark and white noise machine is on. She goes to bed around 7:30-8pm.

She used to sleep swaddled and rocked but now she sleeps on her own. I do not hold her or rock her or event pat her.

She does not sleep while feeding. She usually is drowsy or even fully awake when putting in bed.

She used to be a good sleeper before 3 months. Only woke up every 4 hours. But everything changed when she learned to roll around 3.5 months and since then she wakes up every 2-3 hours at night. She goes to bed around 7:30-8pm. She sleeps and then she wakes up around 10:30 I usually dream feed her.

She was better when we started sleep training like waking every 3hrs. But she got worse over time!!

She eats about 35-40 Oz per day. It doesn't matter if I gave her formula or breast milk. She would wake up every 2-2:30 hrs at night. She would eat around 3-4 Oz in midnight feeding

During the day She usually eats every 2:30-3 hr about 4 Oz. She does not have a very distinct schedule for naps. Since she started fighting naps around 3 months. She usually gets one nap before noon and 1 nap in the afternoon sometime a short nap in the evening. She still naps in her swing. Truthfully I never had time and energy to wean her off from the swing.

I am soooo exhausted. I am Exclusive pumping and with her sleep pattern, I don't get that much rest through the night.

I am not a fan of a cry it out method. I just can't do it.

Her pediatrician(which have changed recently) suggested me to start the bedtime routine and said she would automatically and on her own pace drop the night feeding. But She got worse! I am afraid she even become much worse!!!

I have not started solid food yet. I just introducing her to some vegetable every day.

What is your suggestion for her to have longer sleep without feeding?

What am I doing wrong in the sleep training method?

Any advice and suggestions will be greatly appreciated!!!

P.S. I only change her once in midnight without using a wipe.

She is a big baby. She is in 90percentile in height and weight.

Now with Ferber he usually settles in less that ten minutes, on his own. It’s a miracle!!

I do have a question though- he is still crying very animatedly before bedtime (wake window is about 2.5 hours before bed) he’s obviously tired and will eat very well and be super calm after our bedtime routine (cereal, bathtime, massage, lotion, bottle, lullabies) and then will all of the sudden scream like he is on fire for about 7-8 minutes and pass out. From there he sleeps just fine for about 11-12 hours and wakes up happy. Is that normal? Does that go away with time? Should I be worried? Would love input!","Ferber Success!

Also she barely napped. Somehow we all survived.
So fast forward to now with my 8 month old. Somehow we went from him sleeping through the night at 2 months in his crib in our room to cosleeping and waking up all the time and a terrible napper (in his crib in his room). The cosleeping was unintentional (from side feeding since my oversupply was drowning him). Also he had multiple colds in the beginning and I felt better with him next to me. I have the Precious Sleep book—I never got far but what stuck was that you don’t create bad habits in the first few months. And that’s how we established the cosleeping habit and constant comfort feeding (and me as the pack). It was hard to stop after the 3rd month. I guess I should read the rest of the book but I’m a bit torn. 
The main reason to sleep train would be if it helps him learn to sleep better and have better naps. I don’t mind night time but it’s obvious he has trouble with naps. Going through here it seems naps are different anyway and then the book also says 8-10 months isn’t the ideal time to sleep train. And now my mom is taking care of him but he’ll start daycare at 1. That will be a shock to the system since they aren’t going to rock and sing him to sleep. Do I sleep train now even if it isn’t the best time? Before he’s crawling and walking at least. Or wait until 11 months but then he’s off to daycare as well. I have to say I’m going to miss the bedtime cuddles, especially if he’s in daycare.

"ST/CT Going strangely well at night, not for naps",sleeptrain,3,cvbvvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/cvbvvk/stct_going_strangely_well_at_night_not_for_naps/,2,1566785143.0,"Last night was night three of sleep/crib training my 9mo old who has neither STTN or slept in her crib. Night 1 was rough, nights 2&3 she STTN beautifully, in the crib. We are letting her CIO for a few minutes, and she has put herself to sleep both nights. 

Naps are a different story. She absolutely will not give up and fall asleep. I know it’s still early, so I’m not expecting a quick miracle. She’ll fall asleep nursing, so I know she’s tired and ready for a nap, I put her in the crib and she is immediately screaming. She doesn’t let up. I’ll get her and try again in 30 mins, and it’s the same. She’s still tired, falling asleep on me, but won’t in the crib. 

Is nap time just generally harder?


Also- does anyone notice a change in their baby’s general disposition while ST? She is normally very happy and fun, and since we’ve started, she seems to be sad and angry almost all the time. She does have a stuffy nose so maybe it could be chalked up to that. Or maybe it’s my imagination because I feel bad for her and kind of subconsciously worry that I’m screwing up her brain. 🤷🏻‍♀️","ST/CT Going strangely well at night, not for napsLast night was night three of sleep/crib training my 9mo old who has neither STTN or slept in her crib.

Sleep trained 7 month old waking in the middle of the night and needing help going back to sleep - how to handle?,sleeptrain,1,cv96nx,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/cv96nx/sleep_trained_7_month_old_waking_in_the_middle_of/,6,1566772271.0,"My girl turns 7 months in a week and has been sleep trained for awhile now. We started right at 4 months and she has been falling asleep on her own at night and for naps. We did CIO (tried Ferber but the checks made her more upset), and she never cried more than 30 minutes. We do one dream feed between 11 and 12, and recently eliminated the middle of the night feed (anytime between 2:30 and 5) a few weeks ago. She has rarely woken up during the night more than to just resettle herself and go back to sleep within a couple of minutes.

This changed about 5 days ago - she's been waking up between 4 and 4:30 crying and will not resettle herself, though it's obvious she's still tired and not ready to be up for the day. I've been going in to settle her, but need make a change since I'm seeing this turn into the new normal vs. a 1-2 day oddity.

Before anyone asks, she naps pretty well. Here's her typical schedule:

6:30-7:30 wake up

8:30-9:30 first nap for 1-1.5 hours

12-1 second nap for 1.5-2 hours

4-4:30 third nap for 0.5-1 hour

7:30-8 bedtime

Pretty sure she still needs the third nap, as we only dropped the fourth about a month ago and she seems tired and ready to sleep at all her nap times still. Also, she doesn't seem sick and isn't teething (already has 2 teeth so we have an idea of what to expect for the next ones).

Any thoughts on why this is happening and the best way to deal with it?  We tried letting her CIO last night and she progressively got more upset until I went in to settle her (which takes 20-40 minutes) when she got close to throwing up. Any help or ideas would be much appreciated. I was finally enjoying a longer stretch of uninterrupted sleep and would like to get that back if at all possible!","Sleep trained 7 month old waking in the middle of the night and needing help going back to sleep - how to handle?My girl turns 7 months in a week and has been sleep trained for awhile now.

Out of the last four nights, she's slept through two night but the other two she's been up for FIVE HOURS at night (Last night she went to bed at 8:00 then was up from 11:30-4:30). Her naps are getting worse too. She is on one nap which used to be two hours but is now 30-40 minutes. This is worse than the newborn stage and I feel like I'm losing my mind.

Normal Schedule: wake-7:00; nap - 12:00-1:30/2:00; Bed-7:45/8:00

We think it might be separation anxiety because she's very happy once one of us is in her room. We've tried medicine, feeding, rocking, but nothing works. We give her an hour between check-ins to settle herself (I have no issue with CIO). I took her to the doctor because I suspected an ear infection, but she said there is no medical reason for her wakings.

My question is: if he keeps this up, are we better off to move to one nap on daycare days and have them put him down midday so at least if he takes a crap nap, he won’t have been up since before noon when I pick him up?

They also record all his nap attempts, and give him 15 mins to try and put himself to sleep (at home he can take 10/15 mins to settle so we make sure they give him a chance before calling the nap attempt a fail.)

He says she isn’t ready yet since she doesn’t yet have a good long stretch of sleep consistently. She has on occasion gone 7-8 hours of sleep without eating or waking. However, it’s been a while. He says if she starts doing that more consistently she will be ready to sleep train, so we don’t have to expect two results from the training. The results being 1. Falling asleep on her own 2.

He goes into his crib at bedtime awake after a bedtime routine and sleeps from 7:30-6:30/7 with 1-2 feeds (usually at 4am, or 3am and 6am). He falls asleep immediately after feeds. The last step of his bedtime routine is a cuddle and popping in of his paci. He only gets the paci to sleep. 

All of this sounds great, however, we are up multiple times a night to replace the paci. We usually need to give it back to him once or twice as he’s falling asleep and then he’s good for several hours (so I know he can connect sleep cycles and I can see he spits it out on the monitor during that time). But it depends on the night - some nights he won’t need it replaced until after his feed, other nights (like last night), we did it about 4 times. So even though he’s sleeping, I’m still exhausted. 

I can’t decide if this is cause to sleep train and take the paci away completely or if we just need to wait him out until he can replace it himself.

My ten month old started waking in the middle of the night this past week and has also started waking an hour earlier, sometimes two hours earlier. 

We're switching from breastmilk to formula and I'm wondering if that has something to do with it. The first night LO woke up at midnight and cried for almost an hour (off and on - it sounded like should would fall back asleep several times) so I got up and prepared a bottle for her and she drank about 4 ounces. 

The next night I made extra formula for her but the problem is we only have one 5 ounce bottle with the nipple LO likes so I had the rest in a jar. When the first bottle was empty I quickly dumped the jar into the bottle but it was enough that LO didn't want to keep going. I need to get a bigger bottle obviously (of course LO likes the ridiculously expensive ones) but I'm not sure what else to do. 

We've used the sleep easy solutions book and have had success, I just don't know what to do when LO gets up in the middle of the night. For those unfamiliar with this sleep training method you do quick check ins at different intervals (5, 10,15 minutes) and tell LO ""it's okay, go to sleep, mommy's here"", etc then leave the room. Obviously if she's hungry or needs a diaper change I'm going to take care of that, I'm just concerned that we're going to start encouraging a habit of her waking up every night. 

LO slept through the night starting around 6/7 months. 

I think my main concern is that the switch to formula is causing her to be hungry. I've heard formula won't keep a baby as full for as long as breastmilk would (did that make sense?). We stopped doing the dream feed around 7/8 months as it would make LO wake up and be wired suddenly. She wouldn't fall back asleep after the dream feed. I suppose I could explore doing the dream feed again but I would feel really mean if I woke her up and she didn't want a bottle. 

I dont know. Sorry for the long post. Hopefully someone reads this and can offer suggestions! I'm just tired. Oh and today's my birthday but baby didn't care, she got up at 4am 🙄","Waking in the middle of the nightHi all! New to this sub. 

My ten month old started waking in the middle of the night this past week and has also started waking an hour earlier, sometimes two hours earlier. 

We're switching from breastmilk to formula and I'm wondering if that has something to do with it. The first night LO woke up at midnight and cried for almost an hour (off and on - it sounded like should would fall back asleep several times) so I got up and prepared a bottle for her and she drank about 4 ounces. 

The next night I made extra formula for her but the problem is we only have one 5 ounce bottle with the nipple LO likes so I had the rest in a jar. When the first bottle was empty I quickly dumped the jar into the bottle but it was enough that LO didn't want to keep going.

Putting her back to sleep isn’t a huge deal, she normally responds pretty well to the rocking and paci, but it’s the not staying asleep that gets me. We already have her in her crib in her own room.

We’ve got the going to bed routine down, and she does great going to sleep without aid (boob, paci, etc.) She also naps without nursing, but naps only last about 30 minutes. That’s a battle for another day. 

The problem now is she still wakes every 1.5 hours during the night to nurse. I’ve given in previously bc her weight was a concern at her four month appointment (low percentile, not underweight) and honestly, though he’s never asked, to avoid waking my husband who works and is in law school (I don’t work). Because I would scoop her up and nurse before she full on cried, I suspect much of the feeding has become a crutch for comfort/falling back asleep and is unnecessary. I’m exhausted. 

I wouldn’t mind doing 2-3 night feeds for now until solids are in full force because of her weight, but how do I teach her to differentiate between needing to soothe herself back to sleep or needing to eat? 

Like tonight, if she wakes and wants to eat but shouldn’t need to yet, what do I do if she refuses to go back to sleep without it? When my husband has tried to comfort with rocking or singing, she was not at all receptive.","What to do in the middle of the night?My girl is 5 months old.

PSA: If you are struggling with early wakings and you think your baby's room is dark enough...

Perhaps, after two nights, it is too early to call it a full-blown success, but after MONTHS of early wakings that were getting progressively worse, the past two nights have been blissful.

We thought the room was dark enough... we had blackout curtains.... the door was closed... and we were using a very subtle turtle star projection that automatically turned off after 45mins (it was just for comfort and winding down)... and a nightlight, but it was incredibly dim. The nightlight stayed on all night. I never really thought it could have been the culprit. I realize that may sound stupid now, but I really thought it was other things... we moved her bedtime around, tried a dreamfeed even though she hadn't needed food overnight in a couple months, tried just letting her cry in the morning, and I thought I was doing the right thing by keeping her up for her first nap *until* 2-2.5hours after desired bedtime (baby is now 10months old). ALL of that and it was the stinking nightlight.

We turned it off two nights ago and WHAT A DIFFERENCE. She stirred at 5:30a (previously it has been closer to 4:30a-5a wake-ups), but then went back to sleep at some point until 6:45a. And she didn't wake hysterically crying! It was such a dramatic difference that we knew we had to remedy the light for her naps too. So we added extra padding to blockout the slivers of light that could creep in around the curtains, through a blanket near her door so no light could get under there, and of course, got rid of the godforsaken nightlight.

 We have gotten her naps to more ideal times and awake windows and finally moved her insanely early bedtime (5:30p-6p) until 6:45p-7p. We had given up hope for awhile on resolving the early wakings, so we were putting her to bed earlier as it was the only way she would get enough sleep. Now her naps have improved. She sleeps for 1.5 hours!

I feel like this is too good to be true... I can only hope it continues and this becomes our new normal.

Looking for support regarding 14 month old's sleep regression and nap transition,sleeptrain,4,cthdsz,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/cthdsz/looking_for_support_regarding_14_month_olds_sleep/,3,1566425341.0,"Hi all! I sleep trained my daughter when she was 10 months old with the support of this sub. We did CIO after unsuccessful attempts using the Ferber method. It worked quite well but resulted in early waking that has persisted and in the last few months gotten quite a bit worse. It seems like she is also in the process of dropping a nap and we are quickly backsliding into pre-sleep training sleeplessness. If anyone has some insight into how to move forward I would really appreciate it. Our bedtime routine is nurse, book, bath, PJ's and then I put her down awake. She sleeps in her own room in a crib with white noise and the room is 100% blacked out.

The main problem is the early waking. After CIO, she started waking at 5/530. I was ok with this because I know I can't expect her to sleep for 12+ hours at night. She slowly started waking earlier and for the past month or two has been waking between 4 and 5. I tried leaving her in her crib until 5:30 but she would *never* go back to sleep. I wish that she was the type of baby that would just play in her crib until I got her, but she gets instantly upset and cries endlessly. If she woke up at 4 she would cry hard until 5:30 and I just couldn't handle it after a couple weeks, especially because she didn't make any improvement. At that point I tried sending my husband in to offer her water and try to settle her down, but that didn't work either so since then I have been going in to nurse her back to sleep. It takes about 45 minutes to nurse her and transfer her to her crib after which she will usually sleep until about 630/7. Fine. So be it. But then in the last two weeks she has had several nights where she wakes up in the middle of the night and cries. One night it took 5 hrs to get her back to sleep. Last night it took 2 and I had to go sit in my car to keep my anxiety down and prevent myself from going in to nurse her...which I ended up doing anyway because she was going to lose her voice. I'm confused because she had been great after CIO (minus the early waking of course), and there doesn't seem to be a pattern with her middle of the night upsets and some nights she sleeps until 5 without a peep. 

On top of the weird nights and early mornings, our nap schedule has been super wonky. I know it's common for the 2-1 transition to happen at this time but I am having trouble committing to it/knowing how to navigate it. Ideally I would be pushing her first nap later and later, but when she has lost hours of sleep the night before and then is up super early she is too tired to make it past 9AM without a nap. On days where she needs a morning nap she will not take a second nap. Yesterday she was awake from 10:30AM to 6PM, which is maybe why she had a rough night as she was likely overtired. I'm struggling because it seems like a vicious cycle where the early morning prevents the nap transition and the inability to make the transition makes her overtired and sleep crappy that night. She also seems to have lost the ability to connect sleep cycles during the day in that she will wake from a nap after only 25 or 40 minutes and need to be nursed/held for the rest of the nap. Help?? haha. 

I know this is a long post but just a few more details: I have not nap trained her as I haven't yet had the courage. She either gets nursed and rocked to sleep by me or gets a bottle from someone else. She has never been interested in a lovey (there is one in her crib that just hangs out there unnoticed) and I weaned her from a soother at 8 months. She used to have a consistent bedtime of 7PM but lately that's been moving around depending on her nap schedule. If she skips a second nap I put her down at 6PM. Her usual nap length is around 1hr 15 minutes. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I'm open to all suggestions, including trying CIO again. I might just need the extra push from this sub to go down that route again as it's quite stressful and she's a pretty stubborn lady.","Looking for support regarding 14 month old's sleep regression and nap transitionHi all!

My baby boy is 4 months old, but was 4 weeks early so 3 months old gestational age. I breast feed and was lucky enough to extend my mat leave so will be going back to work when he’s 5 months old (4 mos. gestational age). Night time sleep is ok...bed time around 8/8:30, with wake ups at ~2, 4:30, then 6:45/7. Won’t be ideal when I’m back at work but doable I suppose until we can sleep train. I am struggling HARD with naps though, and worry about my little one adjusting to daycare / mother in law watching him in a few short weeks. 

His 1st nap is usually easiest, will get sleepy ~1 hour after wake up and I can typically get him to sleep independently in bassinet. Everything else in the day is a total crapshoot. Sometimes will accept bassinet, sometimes will only sleep on me. Sometimes will have 1 long nap midday, sometimes crap naps of 20 mins all day. I really struggle with setting up a routine for him. What do you recommend?!

Can I start something (anything) now to help my baby? I worry about his development when he doesn’t get good naps in. And I worry about care providers handling him in a few short weeks.

Night time sleep is ok...bed time around 8/8:30, with wake ups at ~2, 4:30, then 6:45/7. Won’t be ideal when I’m back at work but doable I suppose until we can sleep train. I am struggling HARD with naps though, and worry about my little one adjusting to daycare / mother in law watching him in a few short weeks. 

His 1st nap is usually easiest, will get sleepy ~1 hour after wake up and I can typically get him to sleep independently in bassinet. Everything else in the day is a total crapshoot. Sometimes will accept bassinet, sometimes will only sleep on me. Sometimes will have 1 long nap midday, sometimes crap naps of 20 mins all day. I really struggle with setting up a routine for him. What do you recommend?!

Can I start something (anything) now to help my baby? I worry about his development when he doesn’t get good naps in. And I worry about care providers handling him in a few short weeks. 

Thank you in advance!"

We were hoping to get her to 6a wakeup, but we ultimately started to accept that she might just have an early clock. These are the things we tried to extend wakeup that haven’t worked:

Dreamfeed. She’d previously slept through night without feed but we thought maybe she was hungry.

Earlier bedtime.
Extend last awake period from 3-3.5hrs to 3.5-4hrs.

There’s a few rare days were he’ll be put down and stay down for an hour or so, and there’s a few more days where he’ll be put down and stay asleep for another 20 minutes before waking up screaming. However, most of the time he will wake up immediately if put down.

How do I help him learn to nap on his own? I’m afraid to let him cry it out because he’s so young. And up until now I’ve been pretty careless about letting him feed to sleep, cuddle to sleep, etc. Is the only way forward establishing a nap routine? How do you get 2 month olds to stay asleep long enough during naps so you can fold the laundry????????"

Is there a scenario where I check on him, shush him and pat his butt, but then leave with him still crying? And then start the stopwatch again?**

Hi, all! Father of an energetic little 6-month-old here.

Our little guy is always on the move, and that sometimes means a lot of wiggling/talking/even smiling and rolling around at bedtime.

Up until last week, we were doing overnight bottle feeds -- which we had been doing since he was a newborn. With these, he was getting up 1-2 (and sometimes 3) times a night, at which point we'd give him a bottle and he'd usually go back to sleep pretty easily.

After his 6-month doctor's appointment last week, we decided to phase out the overnight feeds and then start with Ferber in hopes of us all getting some more sleep.

The past two nights, he miraculously slept through the night on his own-- so we didn't even need to do any check-ins or anything.

Tonight, though, I can tell it's gonna be a bit tougher. He had a super late nap and now he's in bed, just rolling around, and occasionally whimpering or crying.

My long-winded question is: after he's consistently crying, and after the stopwatch hits three minutes, how much patting his butt and shushing him do I do before I leave the room? He traditionally doesn't calm down without my wife or me picking him up. So if his crying is consistent and I go in for a check, what triggers me then leaving again? Is there a scenario where I go in, shush him, and then leave, even with him still crying?

Thanks in advance, sorry for the novel of a post.","Ferberizing Starts Tonight: Questions about Crying**Tl;dr: if he cries even during my Ferber check-ins, at what point do I then leave the room?

How to get back to sleeping through the night?,sleeptrain,3,cr0aeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/cr0aeu/how_to_get_back_to_sleeping_through_the_night/,8,1565952782.0,"My guy used to be a great sleeper. We did sleep training around 3 months, and he slept through for about two months after that, yay! Then around 5.5-6 months his sleep broke.  Previously, if he did wake up, after letting him fuss for a bit to make sure he didn't go back to sleep again, he'd eat and pass right back out. That stopped. For a while we had 1-2 wakeups a night, sometimes each as much as two hours long. If it wasn't ""time""for him to eat, I wouldn't feed him, but after a while of trying everything else, I would feed him and he'd go to sleep.  Eventually his timing got predictable, we night weaned, he slept. yay!

For 3 nights.

Next he got into a pattern where he would sleep through if he had bottles during the day, but if it was an all boob day he wouldn't. This didn't really make sense since my pumping matches what he eats and his solid intake is always hefty, but sure. We tried bottles before bed in case he wasn't getting enough. It also worked!

For 3 nights. 

Now at 9 months sometimes he'll sleep through and sometimes he won't. He doesn't wake up at the same time every night. Some nights he goes right to sleep after eating, and sometimes he will be up for like an hour afterwards. He won't go back to sleep if I let him cry it out without feeding him (I do checks).  Sometimes I give him Tylenol because we suspect teething. He's a big guy and eats seemingly well during the day.

So what do I do to get him back on track? 

TLDR: 9 month old previously slept through the night and then stopped at 6 months. After much trial he's down to one wakeup a night at random times for random amount of times. 

For whatever it's worth, he doesn't have any teeth yet, they're just all lining up under his gums but have been like that for a while.","How to get back to sleeping through the night?My guy used to be a great sleeper.

11-month old no longer self-soothes. Separation Anxiety?,sleeptrain,4,cq9qb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/cq9qb6/11month_old_no_longer_selfsoothes_separation/,13,1565818416.0,"Hi there

I've tried to look this up online but couldn't really find a definite answer. So, I'm hoping to find some answers here. 

So, basically our nearly 11-month old daughter used to fall asleep in her crib by herself after we sleep trained at 7 months. Some nights we would have to go in and calm her down a few times but mostly she was able to do it herself. Same for naps. 

However, now she starts full on wailing as soon as we put her in the crib. She also tosses her pacifier, which doesn't help, because it is her sleep aid. This has been going on for over a week and it only seems to get worse.
We tried rocking her to sleep in the crib, it takes a long time and often she wakes up again screaming once she notices that we left.
She will eventually fall asleep in our arms or if she's in our bed. But this is obviously not really a long-term solution.
If we let her cry for a few minutes before going back in, she just seems to get hysterical.
We also tried both prolonging and shortening the awake times.

She has four teeth already and doesn't seem to be teething at the moment. No fever or anything either.

I have read that it might be separation anxiety and I don't really know how to tackle it. Should we wait a bit longer to see if it passes by itself and just get her to sleep any way we can. Or should we let her cry and just go in every few minutes to comfort? The thing is she is not just crying but sobbing and screaming and it feels like she works herself into a fit if we leave her alone. That is why I was thinking, we might just need to help her fall asleep but on the other hand, I do not want to create bad sleeping habits either.

I've tried to look this up online but couldn't really find a definite answer. So, I'm hoping to find some answers here. 

So, basically our nearly 11-month old daughter used to fall asleep in her crib by herself after we sleep trained at 7 months. Some nights we would have to go in and calm her down a few times but mostly she was able to do it herself. Same for naps. 

However, now she starts full on wailing as soon as we put her in the crib. She also tosses her pacifier, which doesn't help, because it is her sleep aid. This has been going on for over a week and it only seems to get worse.
We tried rocking her to sleep in the crib, it takes a long time and often she wakes up again screaming once she notices that we left.
She will eventually fall asleep in our arms or if she's in our bed. But this is obviously not really a long-term solution.
If we let her cry for a few minutes before going back in, she just seems to get hysterical.
We also tried both prolonging and shortening the awake times.

Update: When does it get better?,sleeptrain,8,cq72k1,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/cq72k1/update_when_does_it_get_better/,3,1565802169.0,"Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/cjr0mi/when_does_it_get_better).

We're now two weeks on, so I thought I'd provide an update and maybe answer my own question.

Night 3 was awful. Lots of crying and lots of wake-ups. Night 4 went unexpectedly well when the boy worked out how to lie on his back instead of sitting up (I fell asleep watching the monitor so I'm not sure how he did it). Night 5 was worse again. 

From night 6 things got steadily easier. 

He still sleeps sitting up. Most nights he gets right up to the bars and dangles his legs over the edge. It's silly and adorable. Any attempts to lay him down wake him up and make him really angry, so we stopped trying, and somehow he still gets decent sleep that way. Last night he sort of folded himself over his legs and slept on his front, so I'm hoping that's the start of his actually lying down.

He still cries for a bit at bedtime, but it's down to 10 minutes or so. I've been trying slightly earlier and later times and different awake times but haven't quite nailed it down yet.

He's quick at getting himself back to sleep in the night now - less than 5 minutes of fussing. He usually wakes up around 1am for a feed but otherwise sleeps through. On Saturday night he actually went from 8.30pm-5am, but that appears to have been a fluke.

We're also tweaking his bedtime routine. It used to start with a bath, but we found that he started crying as soon as he got in the tub, all the way to bed. Baths were his favourite thing before! So we've moved bath time out of the routine, to just after dinner. Last night, after 3 nights, he was no longer upset in the bath. Our routine is now short and sweet: boob, change into jammies, book and/or lullaby, bed.

It's still a work in progress, but things are a lot better!","Update: When does it get better?Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/cjr0mi/when_does_it_get_better).

My LO is just turned 6 months old (gestationally 5 months as he was early). We just finished night 7 of the Sleep Sense program (the stay in the room version). He was waking on average 4 times a night to feed and for a cuddle, so our goals with sleep training are: 1-2 night wakings, with a feed if needed.

We do think we are seeing some progress, as he is overall taking less time to fall asleep and spends less time ""scream crying"" and more time babbling or just fussing. We are also now getting him to sleep until 6 or 7am instead of 5 or 5:30, which is a huge plus! Naps are also going better, with longer stretches and better wake windows.

However, he is still waking 4-5 times a night, only now we are only feeding him twice (with at least 4 hours between feeds). Is this normal for a week in, and will his night wakings lessen as he learns he doesn't get fed each time?

Some caveats first, we've just come back from holiday, a 8 hour timezone change. Whilst on holiday she had grandma or us in the same room as her. Since landing we've been trying to run to schedule (since Tuesday).

Saturday nap was mostly also screaming. 

Saturday night was screaming from the start for about an hour. Again we went in a couple of times. 

Sunday, and she's now screaming during her nap as I write this.

Saturday nap was mostly also screaming. 

Saturday night was screaming from the start for about an hour. Again we went in a couple of times. 

Sunday, and she's now screaming during her nap as I write this. 

Screaming is really really unusual for her, she's very chatty if she wakes up normally. 

She seems consistently tired before we put her down.

Are we suffering with her jet lag? Are we suffering a bout of separation anxiety?

What can we do?"
Is this too much crying?

She’s 5.5 months. I think part of the problem is we are weaning the Snoo at the same time. We tried and failed the recommended Snoo weaning techniques and just decided to cold turkey move to crib and sleep train. I’m second guessing this decision!!

The first stretch at 7pm, she cried for 27 minutes and then fell asleep. Yay right? But then woke up 30 min later and this time cried for a full hour. She ended up waking up throughout the night for a total crying time of over 5 hours. We got her out of bed at 6 (during a slight lull in the crying but she was awake). So that means she slept less than 6 hours total. Her longest sleep stretch was about 3 hours from 130-430. Her longest crying time was an hour, she usually fell back asleep within 30 minutes, just woke back up frequently. 

I feel like I cried about as much as she did, and I feel terrible. Is this too much? Seems like so much more than what I’m reading in this group. Also, TCB says the average crying time is 30-180 minutes total...we are WAY over that! Is she not ready?!","Is this too much crying?

9 month old crying to sleep every night for almost 2 weeks,sleeptrain,14,coqkep,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/coqkep/9_month_old_crying_to_sleep_every_night_for/,4,1565515420.0,"Help! I am so confused about what's going on with my baby. He's just shy of 9 months. In the last month, he started crawling, got his first 2 teeth, started standing (about a week ago), traveled, and has had a cold the last few days. Plus he's probably going through a sleep regression and separation anxiety has definitely set in.

So with all this going on, I'm not even sure where I went wrong. I did cry it out when he was about 6 months old, and the first 2 nights were rough (about an hour each of crying), but after that, he usually only cried for a few minutes (if at all) and went down to sleep pretty well. We still struggled with a lot of night time wakings, but because he doesn't eat great during the day (super easily distracted - basically just grazes so he's not starving), I was still nursing him when he'd wake up every 2-3 hours throughout the night. But bedtime has been consistently pretty easy for 2-3 months.

So the reason I'm writing is this -- while we were traveling for 9 days, we sometimes had to hold him until he fell asleep. He just couldn't sleep well at my mom's house. It wasn't very dark, the pack n play was crinkly/loud, there was a lot of noise in the house from other people, etc. It sucked, but there was no way around it, and I figured we'd just have to do CIO all over again when we got home. Which we did - except instead of it taking 2-3 nights, it's been 10 and I'm losing my mind. He has cried himself to sleep every night, on average for about 20 minutes. I just hit the 30 min mark tonight and started writing this post. He's still crying. He cycles up and down. Is this still because of all the changes/developments/regression going on this month? I'm worried I broke him! I don't even know what to do if I can't get CIO to work... We aren't doing checks or anything at this point. Every night since I've been back, I've done the full extinction version of CIO (haven't gone in at all). Any ideas? Did anything like this happen to you at this age? I guess I'm hoping that I'm still doing things right, and this is just a phase... 

Other info: he doesn't take a pacifier, I have him in a sleep sack, he has a wake window of 3.5-4 hours before bed, I feed him for the last time at least 30 min before bedtime, we have a routine, we have a white noise machine, we have black out shades. His naps are really different depending on the day - he naps horribly at daycare (sometimes 30 min total during the day and then a 30 min nap on the drive home at 4pm), but he napped really well at home today... it doesn't seem to make a big difference since he cries every night.","9 month old crying to sleep every night for almost 2 weeksHelp!

How to reduce habitual night wakings for 8.5 month old?,sleeptrain,11,coe89n,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/coe89n/how_to_reduce_habitual_night_wakings_for_85_month/,11,1565444929.0,"Full term, healthy 8.5 month old, not teething, breastfed, won't take a bottle, no pacifier, I have blackout blinds, he's in his own room, white noise always on. Last feed about 40 minutes before bedtime, when I put him down I walk out before he's asleep so I don't think there are any bad sleep associations.

He goes to bed around 6.30pm, and tends to follow 5-3-3 rule by waking for the first time about 11.30-12.30am then 2.30-3.30am then 5.30am. I used to be able to pull him into bed and nurse him to sleep for an extra hour or so but recently he's decided he's up for the day now between 5.30-6am.

So I'm getting fairly little sleep as I can't generally fall asleep until he's had that first waking. My brain just can't switch off knowing I'm about to get woken.

He's always been quite a difficult baby in that he just doesn't seem to care about the usual things that soothe others like pacifiers, white noise, doesn't thumb suck etc. He just loves the boob and that is what he wants in the night. He's never slept through the night. 

I feed him back to sleep at each waking. I'm not planning to night wean fully. I don't mind getting up for 1 feed or being up for the day at 5.30am if I wasn't woken up at midnight and 3am. I just want to reduce how often he's waking up.

Both of my kids are having sleep problems, but the younger one is the bigger issue. He will be 8 months old next week, is mostly BF, and is generally healthy aside from several serious food allergies and severe eczema (for this reason, he has to sleep in pajamas with built in mittens. I don’t know if that matters but I always mention it). Here is his current 24 hour cycle:
**7am** wake up, nurse, play. Might have some baby food depending on how long he nurses/how hungry he seems. **9:30** takes his first nap. He does not nurse or get a bottle to sleep. Occasionally he will have a pacifier but not always. Basically, we put him in his mitten jammies, pop him in his crib, turn on white noise, and leave. He sleeps about 60-90 minutes. **11am** nurse or have a bottle if I am at work. Play, snack, errands. **1:30pm** nap 2. **3pm** food, play, etc. Now, if some of his morning naps were shorter, or if he’s sick/seems especially fussy, his second nap might be 1-2, and he might take a short power nap from 3:30-4. **5pm** eats baby food, takes a bath, elaborate steroid cream routine for eczema. He nurses/gets a bottle again in this window, sometimes during actual dinner, sometimes after the bath. This depends on how fussy he is, if I’m at work or at home, if his brother is being naughty, etc. But again, he has never fallen asleep while eating. Not even as a newborn. **6pm** read a story, pop him in his crib with the white noise, he falls asleep. **9pm** he wakes up screaming. We wait 20 minutes. The screams get louder (his bedroom is next to our 2 year old’s room, so this becomes concerning). We wait 30 minutes. Screams louder. I go in and nurse him. He keeps screaming.

We did Ferber with my now 18 mo old daughter when she was 6 months old. She took to it like a duck; after 3-4 nights she was totally fine going down on her own and sleeping 7p-6:30/7a, and waking up happy. She was never a LONG napper, but once we sleep trained we started a strong nap routine and she was perfectly fine being put down and falling asleep on her own in her crib, for an hour-1:30. 

Until the last two weeks, where it's going to crap.   
She is still totally happy with our bedtime routine - bath, PJs, milk, a story and cuddles, and down to bed wide awake with her lovey. She goes right to bed without a peep. Over the last two weeks, though, she has been getting up progressively earlier and earlier. It was 6am, then 5:45, then 5:20 ... today we hit a new early record of 4:40. Ugh. To cap it off, she's now waking up incredibly distressed - shrieking and calling our names, and she takes several minutes to calm down and stop trembling when we pick her up. We thought it was the dark, maybe, but she has a nightlight and has since birth. 

Simultaneously, she's totally refusing to sleep in her crib. She is FINE with our usual nap routine - clean diaper, milk and a cuddle, and down to sleep with her lovey. She lays down, is fine and rolls over ... and then as soon as we walk out and shut the door she FREAKS.  The last three days, my husband has let her go for 10-15 minutes, then when she doesn't settle taken her our to the living room ... where she has promptly passed out on the couch and slept for 1:30. 

I'm sure both sleep disturbances are connected somehow, but I'm not sure how - or how best to solve them.   
For the naps, we were thinking maybe it's time for a toddler bed so we could sit with her until she falls asleep? But that's perhaps a bad habit I don't want to encourage. 

For bedtime - maybe a slightly later bedtime? But by 6:30 bath, 7pm bedtime, she's pretty shot. Also, I remember from doing Ferber that if it's within an hour of wakeup time, it's not worth doing intervals - just get them up. But I don't \*want\* her up that early forever, she needs the sleep (she's clearly tired on waking). Do intervals work at that point in the sleep cycle?

But I don't \*want\* her up that early forever, she needs the sleep (she's clearly tired on waking). Do intervals work at that point in the sleep cycle? 

Any advice is greatly appreciated!"

This community has been super helpful while we have been sleep training our 4 month old daughter! It was just as hard as everyone said and more than I could imagine, but we're on the other side and so glad we did it! 

We're about a month out and she goes down wonderfully, stays asleep all night. She goes to sleep at 7:15-7:30. We live in a one bedroom apartment, so we share a room but she is in her crib with a room divider (so she can't see us) and white noise (so she can't hear us). For work I wake her up at 6:00 so I can feed her and have some time with her before I leave at 7:00am. Since starting this whole process, she has been waking up at 5:15-5:30 most mornings and wakes up to the point where she is crying. She doesn't have a poopy diaper, eats ~8oz before she falls asleep, so I don't think she starving (although it may be hunger waking her up). 

45-30 minutes is not long enough to for her put herself back to sleep, but is too long to just put up with it and leave her there until her 6:00 planned wake up. Should I just accept 5:30 as her (and thus my) natural/new wake up time? Or should I let her stay in the crib until 6:00 to be trained to adjust her schedule to wake up at 6:00? 

30 minutes may not seem like much, but it is HUGE to me once I go back to work next week. Thank you in advance for any help!","Slightly early wake upHi all!

I've been sleep training at night but our nap time ritual is still the same. 

Give her to boob till she falls asleep. I feel like this might confuse her since at bed time I feed her then put her in the crib and do cio with irregular shushing and giggling between 5-15 minutes. I only spend 2 minutes in the room at a time. Which has been working pretty well so far. But last night was a little rough. I was wondering if it could be due to the fact I don't continue the sleep training through the day. I can't really though since my husband works nightshift and her nursery is right down the hall from our bedroom. I honestly don't even know if it's normal to sleep train during the day or if it's just a night time thing. I'm very new to this and have no idea what I'm doing. 

I also thought I might add that I'm in the process of night weaning as well. As some one recommend I'm using the 5 day method where you give a little less every day and that also made last night a little rough. I felt bad taking it away after 4 minutes and she cried because she wasn't done.

I don’t want to wake him early and get stuck back in the early bed/early wake loop I worked soooo hard to get out of. But late bedtime means who knows what the heck we’ll be dealing with (restless, unhappy sleep with many wakeups).                

Thanks!"
4 month old used to STTN started waking for one giant feed!

B goes down awake around 6:30 after bath,  book, song and 9/10 times sleeps till 6:30 the next day. A goes down awake after the same routine with more soothing (4-5 songs) and used to STTN mostly for about 20 of past 27 days but now is waking st 3 am and eating 7 oz!!!

We have no done formal ST but followed wake times and got them to eat all calories during they day. They eat 25-30 oz during the day. 

Now they are at day care for the second day. Naps are ok, eating a little less than with us. Usually after her 7 oz overnight feast she also eats 5 oz for breakfast, but today only at 2.

How to night wean or get rid of this feed? She gets so upset and has never been ‘rocked or soothed’ back to sleep during her middle of the night wake because she gets so loud and frantic but I  starting to worry she is eating too much over night (but how after 28-29 oz during  h day)?

What sleep training method would work best for our needs?,sleeptrain,1,cmu6zu,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/cmu6zu/what_sleep_training_method_would_work_best_for/,3,1565144151.0,"Would like to start sleep training our 6.5 month old. He's been co-sleeping with me since about 2 months since it was so much easier to have him close for nighttime nursing, and he also would wake up instantly anytime we put him down in the cosleeper bassinet.

Well, we got a crib because he has started crawling all over the place and especially loves climbing over the pillow barricade we set up around him. My husband and I tried to pit him on the new crib while sleepy, but just like when he was a newborn, he woke up immediately once sensing the new crib mattress and started crying.

I'm open to trying CIO, but don't think we have the fortitude to hear him cry for too long. I don't care about him sleeping through the night, I'm happy to continue nightime nursing, but just want him sleeping I'm his crib instead of with me. It's become a safety issue having him in bed with high potential that he'll fall out.

Night 1 and 2 went so well, night 3 was back to reality. I was cutting night feedings down to 3 minutes. First, I forgot to program my alarm to wake up baby at 12:30AM. I was awaken by baby stirring up in bed at 1AM, I jumped out of bed and went to feed him before he was fully awake. But he kind of was, and this goes against ABCs guidelines (facepalm). Anyway, he fell back to sleep quickly after the 3 minute feed. He woke up again at 2:25AM, and cried on/off until 3:30 (roughly 1 hour of fussing/crying). Baby needed to be asleep for the 3:30 feeding, and finding the right timing was tricky because baby was waking up every 5-10 minutes to cry. When I went in to feed he seemed asleep thought. And after that 3:30 feeding he didn't wakeup until 6:20AM. 

So a little rough compared to other nights, but overall I am happy. It wasn't like ""end of the world"" crying, it was more like fussing and calling me. And he still managed to sleep most of the night with very little milk intake. Tonight is night 4 and ABCs of sleep calls for another day of 3-min. feeds before cutting everything off.

And lately it started to become every 2 hours regularly. I am sooo over it. After trying a couple of night weaning techniques at around 5 months, like increasing the interval between feeds, or decreasing the feeding time, all without success, I then waited to start solids and see if it would help.... and it didn't. In all those attempts, I always waited for baby to wake before feeding. So even when I waited for baby to ""cry it out"" before feeding, I always fed awake after a crying/fussing period, and I think baby just associated waking with me eventually going sooner or later to feed. That's why I decided to try Taking Cara babies' technique, which involves always going to feed baby asleep and not feeding when baby cries, just doing regular checks like the Ferber method. You wake up baby before his regular feeding times (for me it was around 9:30PM, 12:30AM and 3:30AM), and you cut the feeding times from 10min, to 8, 5, 3, and no feed. In 4 days the matter \*should\* be solved. (I decided to keep the 9:30PM dreamfeed to empty my breast for comfort).

Last week, I started to prep my LO. I kept the full feedings, but I fed him before he woke up himself. Just to get him used to not needing to cry to get the breast. And it worked well. Besides me waking him up for feeds, he didn't wake up at all!

Night 1: So I was cutting down to 8 minutes of breastfeeding the 12:30 and 3:30AM feed. It went smoothly just like the 10 minutes feeds we were doing. Down at 7PM, no wake ups in-between feedings, early wakeup at 5:20AM. Fussed in bed until we started our day at 5:30. He was not hungry in the morning.

Night 2: Cutting down to 5 minutes of BF at 12:30 and 3:30AM. Again, very smooth: down at 7PM, no wake ups in-between, fussed at 5:20 again but went quickly back to sleep to wakeup at 6:50AM. Drank maybe for 5 minutes first morning feed, not very hungry (!)

&#x200B;

Today was very encouraging because he breastfeed much more and much better during the day. Before that, he would not drink well, he would roll, and bite at the breast, not very hungry and very very distracted. Now today I could tell he was much more hungry. He did at least 4 good feeds.

So, as the title says, he is waking up about 4 times a night every damn night. I get around 5-6 hours of broken sleep.

We recently had a 4 night break where he slept for 5-6 hours straight, but then it just stopped and we are back to 4 times a night. I usually have to be up for over an hour during one of these.

Bedtime starts 8:00- 8:30 (usually 8:15). He usually goes to sleep at 9. Or if I am unlucky, around 9:20. He wakes up around 7. Often it is before, so less than 10 hours in bed.

Blankets, no blankets, toys in the bed, clothes that smell like me on the side of the bed. Keeping the windows closed, keeping them open so that the traffic provides some white noise. We have blackout curtains.

Other than proper crying it out, what else is there at this point?? I'm really, really struggling now.

Any advice? How do we get her back on track? We basically have gone back to ferber 10-25-20min intervals while she screams in middle of the night but she seems really distressed.. could it be nightmares? not sure what else to do..."

She is now 5.5 months old, still spits up a ton, however is has decreased and she’s back on a perfect weight curve, so....

My question is in regards to her night wakings. First off,  she is pretty sporadic with them. They are never at consistent times throughout the night, it’s typically 2 wake-ups ( last night was 3 every 3 hours, it was an odd off night) and she finishes entire 6 ounce bottles when we feed her. We put her right back in her bed and goes off to sleep completely by herself. I’m just not sure if these are due to pure hunger or if they are habitual. It makes me think they aren’t habit because they are at different times and she knows how to put herself to sleep on her own.

It’s just very odd, her bedtime is around 7, and sometimes she’ll wake up 1.5 hours after bedtime, finish an entire bottle, then go like 6.5 hours and wake again and finish an entire bottle then sleep until morning. Or sometimes she’ll go 4 hours and 4 hours, with no pattern whatsoever. I guess my question is more in regards to the wakeup and finishing a bottle so close to when she goes down.  I’m totally happy with feeding her and don’t mind the wake-ups, it’s more so I’m trying to avoid any issue in the future if they are just based out of habits.

 I believe she is teething but she doesn’t seem in pain overnight so  I don’t think that’s causing her to wakeup. I’m just not sure if  I should begin some night waking training or not!

Sleep is in her crib, in her room, with blackout shades.
No pacifier. We have a 20 min lullaby machine playing. 

We have bedtime down to a science. Bath, bottle, book, lullaby machine on, and baby is fast asleep at 7pm. She wakes between 1230-230 for a feeding (I’m not ready to wean her yet since she’s on the lower side of the weight percentile). She wakes up between 530-630.

This is where our struggle comes in: she has always been a short napper (anytime between 30-45 minutes) with the occasional long nap that fools us into thinking she’s done with catnaps... until the next short nap.

Her awake time is 2.5-3 hours. We don’t have a set schedule for feedings or naps, because we try to follow her cues for both. Nap routine is fresh diaper, bottle, lullaby machine. It can take her up to 15 minutes of fussing and full on crying before falling asleep. So far, to get her to sleep longer, I’ve tried:
-	going in her room and turning the lullaby machine back on before the end of her sleep cycle (0% success of her falling back asleep)
-	waiting 10-15 minutes after her wake up before going in to try to soothe her back to sleep (0% success)
-	waiting an hour from the start of the nap before going in to get her (30% success rate - if she does fall back asleep, it’s usually 15-20 min after she wakes up, and she’ll be fussing or crying the whole time)

I’m pretty well at my wit’s end now. I can see what a huge difference a long, restful nap makes for her. I want to help her sleep longer, I’m just running out of ideas here. Everyone I’ve talked to will either say “oh, she’ll eventually sort herself out into a schedule”, but when exactly is eventually”?! From what I’ve seen with other friends and relatives’ babies, at this age they’re all sorted out into a well established schedule. 

Any advice is welcome 🙏🏻 /r/","8m old with no semblance of a nap scheduleSleep training doing a combination of sleep sense and graduated extinction. Sleep is in her crib, in her room, with blackout shades.
No pacifier. We have a 20 min lullaby machine playing. 

We have bedtime down to a science. Bath, bottle, book, lullaby machine on, and baby is fast asleep at 7pm. She wakes between 1230-230 for a feeding (I’m not ready to wean her yet since she’s on the lower side of the weight percentile). She wakes up between 530-630.

This is where our struggle comes in: she has always been a short napper (anytime between 30-45 minutes) with the occasional long nap that fools us into thinking she’s done with catnaps... until the next short nap.

Her awake time is 2.5-3 hours. We don’t have a set schedule for feedings or naps, because we try to follow her cues for both. Nap routine is fresh diaper, bottle, lullaby machine. It can take her up to 15 minutes of fussing and full on crying before falling asleep. So far, to get her to sleep longer, I’ve tried:
-	going in her room and turning the lullaby machine back on before the end of her sleep cycle (0% success of her falling back asleep)
-	waiting 10-15 minutes after her wake up before going in to try to soothe her back to sleep (0% success)
-	waiting an hour from the start of the nap before going in to get her (30% success rate - if she does fall back asleep, it’s usually 15-20 min after she wakes up, and she’ll be fussing or crying the whole time)

16 Week Old Napping Terribly: Is This Sleep Regression?,sleeptrain,3,clf4sr,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/clf4sr/16_week_old_napping_terribly_is_this_sleep/,5,1564838709.0,"I lurk here all the time, I was trapped under my son for the first three months of his life and it’s because of the info and resources posted here that I gently sleep trained at 13 weeks (modified Taking Cara Babies/PUPD). Just wanted to say thank you regardless of whether I get further help with this issue!

Bedtime is great right now and it’s the only relief I get because NAPS HAVE GONE TO SHIT. Can sleep regression only affect daytime sleep?

He wakes up after 30 minutes (one sleep cycle) no matter what I do! He won’t nap in his bassinet (never has tbh) and even if I let him nap attached to my boob (his *FAVORITE*) 30 minutes later his eyes are creaking open and he’s picking his head up to look around. He’ll be clearly still tired but he fights every nap like he’s a POW and I’m losing my mind. He won’t play or enjoy himself because he’s cranky and he’ll wail and stiffen his body if I try to get him back to sleep. By the end of the day he’s so overtired and I feel like dogshit because I genuinely don’t know how to help him.

If it helps to know: his bedtime is always around 7pm. He sleeps from 7pm to midnight without a meal and then from 12:30 to 2:30/3:30, 3/4 to 5/6 and then is up 7 or 8 for the day. I’m a SAHM and would rock him to sleep for his naps before lying down with him. He’d typically complete a sleep cycle, attach himself to my boob and then slip into a deeper sleep. How I miss those days...

Part of me feels because he’s been taught to sleep independently for bedtime the regression has hit his naps haaaard but I don’t know? Has this happened to anyone before?

Should I start to sleep train him for naptime? He’s so strong willed during the day I was going to tough it out until 6/7 months and then do the Ferber method for naps but maybe it’s worth diving into now since it’s all chaos anyway? 

I don’t even know where to begin with nap training, if anyone has any resources on that I’d appreciate it.

TLDR: My 16 week old is napping terribly and is miserable all day. I’m clueless as to what to do for him.

I put her down for a nap and she wakes up 45 min later happy in her crib, only to show signs of tiredness an hour later ( I know this is from her poor naps). Should  I try extending her wake times even further if she’s waking up happy? It just seems like she is getting sooo tired by 1 hour and 45 minutes.  I know a lot of people say at 5 months her awake time should be 2-2.5 hours. She goes down wide awake so that’s not the issue. Her night sleep is typical 6:30pm-6:30am with two feeds ( I dont feel comfortable weening yet). Any advice,  I will take! What worked for you? Was it a waiting game? Sorry this is so long!"

When he eventually slid down he was instantly fast asleep. He had a couple of wake-ups in the night and I eventually picked him up and held him around 5am.

Last night was worse, even though (or maybe because?) he was completely exhausted. About the same for the beginning of the night, but he only slept 2 hours before he was up again. I fed him and put him back down asleep but he woke up again a short while later. He was sitting up again and nodding off, intermittently crying, then sleeping again.

After a month and a half post-Ferber with no overnight feeds and averaging once wake up per night (which was glorious!), last week our 8 month old daughter just regressed hard, as if a light switch flipped!

These are of course different than a few months ago: the screams start off sounding like scared/desperate cries instead of weary tired cries, and she tends to crawl to the side of the crib soon after waking and stands, usually standing and crying and refusing to sit down. Early in the night this can be fixed with a pacifier and gentle lay down, which takes about 20 seconds, but last night she became hysterical for about two hours, which only stopped because we decided to make a bottle for her (which we haven't been doing in the night for months).

Does this sound like a regression/teething or something more?

We’ve tried check-ins (she gets more upset), CIO extinction (I picked her up after 2 hours), laying on the floor next to her crib, nothing seems to work. She is not teething or sick.

She wakes for the day at 6 due to our work schedules, usually naps at daycare around 930-10 for 45 minutes; naps again around 1-2 for 45 minutes; and again around 430-5 for an hour.

My son just turned three. He's still in a crib, in his own room, right across from ours. He's a great kid, has always sleep 10-11 hours a night but rarely consecutively. He stills naps at school, usually about 2 hours. In September, they will drop the nap.

As an infant, he got into the habit of waking up between 5-6AM and we would bring him into our bed for a little snuggle time before we all headed out to work and daycare.

He went through a couple of sleep regressions that we got past but sometime around April, we got rid of his pacifier (he kept all the animals from his wubnubs), he got sick and my In-laws visited. Night time has been hell since. He wakes up multiple times a night crying for us and wanting to come to our bed.

My husband and I alternate nights and take turns with him. We do the same thing each night since he was an infant: bathe him, sit in a rocker and read together and then put him in his crib with a noise machine and nightlight on. 

Before April, we would rock him for a short while and place him in his crib asleep but post-April he has stayed awake longer and longer. We moved his bedtime later by an hour and we are still struggling. It takes him 1-2 hours to go to sleep and that's with trips to the potty and crying. We try sitting by him and then slowly standing by the door and making our way out. He's better with my husband, who gets him to peacefully lay down faster - with me it's a 2-hr-process.

We have been able to to get the leaving the room process time down, but he wakes up again, at 11 pm, 2 am, 3 am and so on. I feel like I am going to lose my mind and I know he can't be getting enough rest either.

My husband has suggested getting him a big boy bed but I am afraid that's just going to make it worse since he can't get out the crib now. We let him decorate with stuffed animals to no avail.

Success with Ferber- 7m old co-sleeper wearing hip brace,sleeptrain,15,cj6j22,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/cj6j22/success_with_ferber_7m_old_cosleeper_wearing_hip/,13,1564404605.0,"I want to thank this sub for giving me the courage to sleep train my 7 month old baby! For those interested I've written a 7 night summery of our journey with the ferber method. For context baby has co-slept with us since birth and nursed for every waking. She wears an orthotic brace for hip dysplasia (Denis Browne Bar for anyone who's curious) since her 6m check-up and her night wakings have got way worse, around 4-6 times a night. For naps she will sleep in her crib but needed to be bounced on the yoga ball until fully asleep and then transferred, which usually took 2 attempts. She is in the middle of transitioning from 3 naps to 2, right now she usually still has 3 naps and occasionally skips the 3rd. I bought ""Solve your Child's Sleep Problems"" and did our best to follow it exactly for nights and naps. Only if she was really screaming did we start the timer for check ins, any decrease in crying to whimpering or whining the timer was cancelled, to be restarted from the beginning if the crying started again. In the crib she had a nursing pillow to support her legs in the brace and her lovey- a lamb stuffie.

&#x200B;

Night 1- first check in at 3 min because she was full on screaming but stopped crying before the next check in, and fell asleep in 15 min at 7:05pm. First wake at 10:45pm, nursed her she went back to sleep with only a few minutes of whining- no check ins. Second wake at 2:35am, nursed and fell asleep quickly again with no crying. Up for the day at 6am. Amazing first night, only one check in and 2 feedings, huge improvement already! Naps took about 10 min to fall asleep for the first 2 and slept for 1.5 hours each. The third nap took 20 min to fall asleep and slept for 40 min. No crying at all, only some whining so we did not do any checks. She was already a decent napper in the crib, it was really nice to skip bouncing on the yoga ball tho!

&#x200B;

Night 2- No check ins from this day to current, she doesn't cry for long enough, usually not at all. Fell asleep in 10 min at 7:15pm. First wake 9:51pm, asleep by 10:20pm. Second wake at 1:10am, nursed, asleep after a few minutes. Up for the day at 5:40am. Naps were the same as day before. Already down to one night nursing!

&#x200B;

Night 3- Fell asleep at 7:21pm only 8 min to settle. Only wake at 2:50am nursed, back to sleep a few minutes later. Woke for the day at 6:30am. Had 2 naps each 1.5 hour long, skipped the 3rd nap since she did not sleep within the 30 min mark. 

&#x200B;

Night 4- Early bedtime since she missed her last nap. Took ten min to fall asleep by 6:26pm. Only wake at 1:30am, nursed, back down quickly. Up for the day at 5:30am. First nap was 1.5 hrs long, second nap was 2.5 hrs long, third was 20 min long.

&#x200B;

Night 5- Fell asleep at 7:23pm after 9 min in bed. Only wake at 1:13am to nurse, back sleeping pretty much right away. Up for the day at 5:35am (thunder storm woke her up). First 2 naps 1.5 hrs long, third nap 40 min long.

&#x200B;

Night 6- Sleeping almost as soon as she's put down at 7:35pm. Only wake at 4:23am, nursed, back to sleep. Up for the day at 6am. Naps similar to the day before. 

&#x200B;

Night 7- Bed at 7:30pm, had her grandparents put her to bed as we had our evenings back so went on a date night, so took her 20 min to fall asleep at 7:50pm. She slept through the entire night, without any night feeds! Up for the day at 6am. She must of woken up at some point because she was completely sideways in the crib, but she wasn't loud enough to wake us on the monitor. first nap was 2.5 hrs long, second nap was 2 hrs long, did not attempt third nap.

&#x200B;

Unbelievable success with ferber! I've read stories like this before and thought not my baby, she's going to be impossible to sleep train- way too clingy, nursed all night long, she's too uncomfortable in the brace to sleep well. Not the case. I've never been so happy to be proven wrong.

I’m starting to lose my mind and think it’s time to move him to his crib. Today I rearranged his nursery with a video monitor and blackout curtains. 

I need tips, advice, and a plan for my partner and I so that we can be on the same page. We have a good bedtime routine of dinner, play, bath, book, then walking around the house to say goodnight. LO will actually start waving goodnight during the day if he’s tired - it’s super adorable. 

I’m up for only a small amount of crying. My hunch is that dad will have to do most of the work here because as soon as LO sees me he wants boob.

He fell calmed down after 5 min of cuddles and paci, went back in the crib awake and fell asleep.

Routine-ish: Possible bath, lotion/quick massage, nurse, white noise, and lights out.

He sleeps relatively great as a whole. Have gotten a 9.5 hr night recently, with 2-3 NW's being the usual. NBD, right. His naps have even consolidated the past 4 days and now he takes 1 short nap (40-50 min) and 2 longer naps (1.5-2.5 hrs). Awesome!

Try to keep his WT's no longer than 2 hours.

But here's the issue: we were rocking him, but as I mentioned... he has taken to thrashing, kicking, squirming, arching, flipping, and so on in my arms. This has led to a terrible ping pong game of putting him down, trying to stand and rock, trying to sit, then finally putting him down to cry while I take a moment to regroup my sanity.

Last night, I finally just put him down and tried to not pick up back up. This led to a 1.5 hr struggle that ended with me nursing and getting him to just finally sleep. He then was terrible all night.

Any advice would be great. Considering sleep training mainly so he can fall asleep on his own. Not sure what else to do. My hope was to gradually shorten the rocking to no rocking, then to shorter times, then to sitting by him, and so on. But I can barely hold him still.

We just started sleep training her using full extinction 9 nights ago. We have read that routine is huge, and that it is necessary to have a routine at bedtime. Our routine was to breastfeed, then bath, then get her dressed in pj’s, then book, then place her in the bed. 

She cried for 25 minutes the first night; only 8 the second night. It stayed less than 10 minutes for about 5 or 6 days. The last 3 days she has only cried for 2 or 3 minutes and has been sleeping through the night with only a couple of infrequent wake ups in the night (she usually only cries for 2 or 3 minutes with these). I feel like it has been really successful!

Our issue is with the routine. Our daughter has learned that the beginning of this routine means that she will be going to bed soon. As soon as we begin taking her close off to prepare for bath time, she becomes upset and starts crying. When we put her in the tub she absolutely freaks out. She screams during the whole bath and the whole time we are drying her off and getting her dressed. She slaps the book out of our hand when we begin reading to her. We play a little song that she likes during getting her dressed; she now intensifies her screaming and crying when we play the song. She is fighting every step of the process because she knows it means she is going to bed soon. Once we place her down, she screams and cries very intensely, but she will now stop after only a couple of minutes. We have stuck to the routine because we read that it was really important, but we don’t know what to do! She used to LOVE bath time and would laugh and play in there. Now it is miserable. She used to love books, but now she associates them with bedtime, and she has even slapped them away when we try to read to her in the daytime. We don’t want her to hate baths and books!

We just started sleep training her using full extinction 9 nights ago. We have read that routine is huge, and that it is necessary to have a routine at bedtime. Our routine was to breastfeed, then bath, then get her dressed in pj’s, then book, then place her in the bed. 

She cried for 25 minutes the first night; only 8 the second night. It stayed less than 10 minutes for about 5 or 6 days. The last 3 days she has only cried for 2 or 3 minutes and has been sleeping through the night with only a couple of infrequent wake ups in the night (she usually only cries for 2 or 3 minutes with these). I feel like it has been really successful!

Our issue is with the routine. Our daughter has learned that the beginning of this routine means that she will be going to bed soon. As soon as we begin taking her close off to prepare for bath time, she becomes upset and starts crying. When we put her in the tub she absolutely freaks out. She screams during the whole bath and the whole time we are drying her off and getting her dressed. She slaps the book out of our hand when we begin reading to her. We play a little song that she likes during getting her dressed; she now intensifies her screaming and crying when we play the song. She is fighting every step of the process because she knows it means she is going to bed soon. Once we place her down, she screams and cries very intensely, but she will now stop after only a couple of minutes. We have stuck to the routine because we read that it was really important, but we don’t know what to do! She used to LOVE bath time and would laugh and play in there. Now it is miserable. She used to love books, but now she associates them with bedtime, and she has even slapped them away when we try to read to her in the daytime. We don’t want her to hate baths and books!

It was, and continues to be, a rollercoaster (I have an epic post history detailing the first two weeks).

The good news is that she seems to put herself to sleep for both nights and naps fairly well. There are hardly any nights where the crying exceeds 10mins and a lot of times, there are no tears. This is major progress.

The bad news is that I cannot seem to figure out how to extend her early-wake ups and I am EXHAUSTED. I feel like no matter what we do, she almost always wakes between 5a - 5:30a. Sometimes she will will between 4-5a too and sometimes there is a poopy diaper which explains it.

Her room is dark, there is a fan that muffles noise. I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO TRY.

She has trouble connecting sleep cycles for naps still... she will sleep 37m and then wake up hysterically crying.

He’s been sleeping through the night for over a year, no problems at all (except occasional, random bad night). 

Fast forward to this week. For the past 4 nights he has screamed when we put him down for bed. Our bedtime routine hasn’t changed.

He would immediately start crying if I put him down. 

I took him to the doctor as he has a history of ear infections and the only symptom is trouble sleeping... but no ear infection. He is teething and currently cutting 2 molars, there are a few more ready to come too. Could all of this just be from teething?

breakfast which he wasn’t feeling today.

9:30 - started looking a bit sleepy, very early signs, so I breast fed again.

9:50 - wet diaper change

9:55 - sing our nap song while rocking him. Turn out lights, close blackout blinds and turn on white noise.

10:00 - place him in crib with his stuffy, smooch on the head and say I love you. He starts crying.

10:45 - ok he’s hysterical now... think maybe he didn’t get enough milk? Try to breast feed again. He takes it, very sleepy after 10mins. Change his wet diaper and put him back down. He starts to cry.

This process repeats for another hour. 

11:45 - offer breast again. He is so sleepy he falls asleep at the breast the second I offer it, but wakes as soon as I pull it from his mouth. I try to keep him up fora feed, manage to give him about 15mins worth before he becomes furious with me. Change his wet diaper, put him down, he’s beside himself with fury the moment he’s out of my arms. I don’t want him to cry for another hour so I hold him for a bit, singing to him. He stares into the distance looking exhausted. When he’s calm I put him back down. He starts to cry again. The same process as before repeats again.

12:45 - I’m desperate, he’s too tired to breast feed. I make him a bottle. He takes 6oz. He looks like hell. I change another wet diaper and try to comfort him. Now he doesn’t want to be held he just arches his back and screams. 

1:00 I put him down and leave him while I chug a cup of coffee and call my husband for a sanity check. He screams like he’s being stabbed the whole time. 

1:15 - I go in and rub his back and sing quietly. He starts laughing. Ok he’s super manic now. I leave the room again.

1:30 - I can’t stand the shrieking. This isn’t right. Checking in every few minutes works so well at night why does it suck to badly for naps?! I go back in and pick him up. He looks so so sad. I put him on my lap and snuggle him. I tell him I love him and offer a boob again. He takes it and latches hard for 15min but doesn’t eat, just gnaws on it. It hurts like hell but he’s not screaming so I just deal. He falls asleep and the latch breaks. I transfer him to the crib and he’s so tired it doesn’t wake him. 

I know he’s going to wake up in 45 minutes still not rested because he always does when he nurses to sleep but I don’t know what else to do. He’ll have just enough energy for maybe 30 minutes of play before this whole nightmare starts over.

I feel like his whole life is just two nice hours in the morning followed by this misery. Ever since his first tooth started poking him on Sunday he’s just been a wreck - not that he napped well before either but this is ridiculous.

We have done 4 weeks with our son at 9 months and he still really struggles. He is crying badly for maybe 20 mins most nights. There has been some variety because we have been on holiday but the routine is always the same. We are essentially at a point where we don't think we will continue. Trouble is he won't take a bottle so it means ny poor wife is committed to being around all the time still which sucks for her.

Has anyone had similar experiences and any tips or alternatives?

This is starting to kill my spirit and the constant sleep interruptions are taking a toll on everyone.

He is breastfed on demand during the day (I’m a stay at home mom), last nursing at 5pm, purée at 6pm, then bath > jammies > bed. We put him down drowsy around 7pm and he’s out within 10 minutes.

When he wakes at night I will nurse him back to sleep, since he is WIDE AWAKE at those times. Like, looking around the crib and whining which eventually leads to full-on crying. We room share and he has slept in his crib since ~3 months old.

Help with 20mo who used to sleep well.,sleeptrain,5,chnefu,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/chnefu/help_with_20mo_who_used_to_sleep_well/,4,1564088686.0,"Hi all! I have a 20 month old who was successfully sleep trained using a modified ferber (verging on ""cry it out"") at 4 months for night and 6 months for naps. He's been sleeping like a champ for pretty much the whole time with a few easy to fix issues along the way for things like teething and weaning. But I just had a baby (6w) and now his sleep is shot. I think the major change to our lives is responsible but I don't know how to fix it. He was sleeping 12 hours at night and 2-3 hours for one nap but he dropped down to 10 hours and 1 hour. I wouldn't be so bothered if it wasn't obvious that he's still very tired and he wakes upset in the morning and downright unconsolable after his nap. It's not uncommon for him to hard cry for an hour after his nap despite all efforts to soothe him. 


It's probably relevant that he goes to bed at 8pm and naps at 1pm. I'm able/willing to adjust these if it might help. I've been scared to because it worked so well since we dropped his 2nd nap about 5 months ago. If he went back to sleeping 12 hours at night it would probably work again. But now that I type that out I wonder if maybe I should switch to earlier, at least for his nap.


To attempt to lengthen his night sleep I've tried both progressive check in's and straight up letting him cry for a while but both result in even harder crying and no sleep. The longest I've waited is an hour before I felt bad because he was crying harder than I've ever heard. I've not been as direct about his naps because the crying is typically worse. I've tried feeding him a high protein snack right before his nap and attempting to feed him a snack directly after to calm him but it doesn't help. I've tried waiting but the longest I've waited is 15 minutes.


He still sleeps in a crib with absolutely nothing in it because he throws anything out anyway. I'm not super wiling to change this because we have some travel coming up and I need him to sleep in a playpen.

Toddler sleep regression; CIO?,sleeptrain,11,chfxz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/chfxz2/toddler_sleep_regression_cio/,4,1564040459.0,"My 20 month old has been a wonderful sleeper since he was a baby; we never really had to sleep train him; I always was super conscious of awake time and as long as we didn’t allow him to become overtired, he always fell asleep on his own. 

Until last week, he’d sleep about 12 hours+ (6:30pm-6:30am) with a nap from about 12:00-1:00 or so. We put him in his crib, he wouldn’t make a peep and fell to sleep on his own. 

Last week, my husband worked two crazy long days and didn’t see my LO. I put LO to bed as usual without an issue, and DH walked into the house and LO heard his voice and started to cry. DH took him out of crib and played with him for about an hour, which I’m thinking has caused this issue but could just be a coincidence. 

Since that night, he screams if we leave him when we put him to bed. I tried sitting in a chair across the hall where he can still see me and that works, however he’s waking up in the middle of the night hysterical when he can no longer see us. 

I’ve let him CIO the last few night wakings and he never falls back to sleep. He will scream and stay standing in his crib, eventually falling asleep standing up resting his little head on the side of his crib. He will fade, wake up screaming, fade, for hours on end. He woke last night at 2:30am and was up crying, standing up and drifting off while standing, for over 4 hours. 

I tried the first few nights to go in and reassure him but it seems to make things worse when we leave again. 

I don’t mind staying with him and putting him back to sleep but I’m afraid this will create a new normal and he will expect that from now on.

So we have been doing the CIO extinction method with our 6mo daughter for about 2 weeks now. There has been definite progress for her ability to fall asleep quickly in the beginning of the night. (Still struggling a bit with self-soothing during night wakings.)

But my question is, she has been contact napping basically since birth. I tried to get her to start crib napping at about 3mo but she would take such short naps in the crib that she was overtired by bedtime. But I would like to get my days back. She's either latched onto my boob most of her nap, or if with Dad, rocking laying on his chest. Any tips for transitioning her to the crib for day sleep? Oh and she doesn't take a pacifier well, btw. Also also she's a very strong willed baby. 😬

In some ways it feels like it would be confusing bouncing her to sleep for naps and making her cry for bedtime...

Nap 1: 9:07 - 11:07 (2 hours)
Nap 2: 2:08 - 3:02 (54 minutes)
Nap 3: 5:03 - 5:38 (35 minutes)
3 hours and 29 minutes total

He woke up for today at 6:33 and I put him down for bed tonight at 7:32."
wake up before 5 am,sleeptrain,7,cguxll,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/cguxll/wake_up_before_5_am/,5,1563928561.0,"For our 2 year old, falling asleep works fairly well, and he has 0 - 3 short wake ups at night, during which it is easy to calm him down and to get him back to sleep.

Biggest - and only remaining - problem: He goes to bed at 8 pm, and often wakes up between 4 and 5 am. Anything after 4 am, he will consider the ""final"" wake up, and do anything he can to insist.

We are not sure if we should treat it in every way like a 1 am wake up, or should consider the possibility that a little over 8 hours are simply enough sometimes.

What we tried: Mother lies next to him until he falls asleep again. Works occasionally only.

One problem is that his diaper is often so soaked at that time that it would be irresponsible to NOT change it, and the diaper change is then his final signal that the day has started.

This leads to massive problems. Occasionally, I lose a full work day (> $ 500), because on my job, I have to stay at home when I can't get enough sleep for security reasons.

Any ideas for longer or later sleep?

He is used to having 1 bottle of warm tea before bed, and one bottle of warm milk right after waking up. Maybe that contributes to the problem?

Attempting to sleep train my 7 month old who is used to bed sharing for all naps and nighttime. ( I know, I know. I’m trying!) 

We’re on night 5 tonight of cry it out method. She seems to cry for about 40 minutes each night until she passes out. But last night she barely got much sleep, she was up crying it seemed every hour or so and then pooped at 3am. 

Then today, she was overall fussy and had 4 naps (normally 2-3). She was so incredibly cranky and tired she went down for a nap at 7:20pm, her normal bedtime is 8:30-9. But there was no way in hell I could keep her up any longer. Should I skip the whole bedtime routine and go straight to her crib for CIO? Or adjust her bedtime tonight so we can do the routine and her go to bed at 9:30-10? 

Any advice is helpful! I’m really struggling with sleep training and so close to sacrificing myself to go to bed at 8:30pm with her every night so we all get sleep and minimal crying *sigh*

Edit: forgot to add that she has 2 teeth and I suspect she’s teething and that’s why she’s especially cranky in addition to getting less sleep last night.","What to do when routine is disrupted?Hello!

Crying for every nap? Is this normal?,sleeptrain,2,cgt9g7,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/cgt9g7/crying_for_every_nap_is_this_normal/,7,1563920709.0,"So our boy is around 5.5 months-ish. He's been sleep trained and generally that goes ok. Usually not much crying (Maybe 5-10 minutes if he's over-tired). BTW side question: Usually his feeding is close to when he goes to bed (around 6pm)....and he often-times falls asleep while feeding. When I put him in the crib he wakes up for a second before going back to sleep. Is this ok? I know you aren't supposed to feed him to sleep but obviously no point in putting him to bed for him to wake up 30 minutes later. FWIW he has no problems going back to sleep when he wakes up (Unless he's over-tired). This doesn't happen every time though (depends on schedule).

Anyways with naps it's been such a crap-shoot. We did swing naps for awhile...but those seem to not be working as well (he gets too distracted by our presence) So we started putting him in the crib. (We tried this before when he was 4 months old...but it did not work, 30 min of crying followed by a 20 min nap for weeks so we said we'd try again later). Now it does seem to be working...better, but he screams basically everytime we do it and it's wearing me out. HOWEVER, on the bright side he actually does seem to be sleeping longer (like 45-50 minutes).

The crying seems to be anywhere from 5-15 minutes, but it's very intense. BUT we know he's tired and he will seriously look at us in the swing for an HOUR+ until he's over-tired (Even if we leave the room he'll be looking around for us). Also he won't really let us rock him to sleep or nap on us either. So do we just let him cry? It makes me feel like such an asshole parent but I know he needs to sleep.

I keep I guess doubting myself everytime he's crying, like he's going to end up hating us. Because it's literally crying every time at this point.","Crying for every nap?

It wasn’t my original plan but he slept better, which meant I slept better and it worked for us. 

However, now he is 4 months old it’s creating some problems. He cannot fall asleep without my nipple in his mouth. If he stirs in his sleep he’ll need it put back in his mouth to drop back to sleep. Which basically means he spends the entire night with his mouth clamped on my boob. 

It’s difficult to say as he’s EBF but I think this has also resulted in him switching to night feeding. He seems to feed a lot less in the day now and his morning nappies are always really heavy, which I’ve been told is a clear sign of night feeding. He wakes me up a lot to go back on the boob in the night, but I don’t really know how much of that is for feeding and how much is just for comfort / to get back to sleep. 

Finally, I feel the cosleeping isn’t really working for us anymore - now he’s older, he’s a lot more active and noisy, even when he’s asleep, so even if he is sleeping, my husband and I aren’t! We have a Next to Me crib that we’ve never used as he wouldn’t even tolerate being that far away from me. My plan would be to get him in to that first and then transition to a cot when he hits 6 months - I feel like going from my bed straight to a cot would be too drastic a change? Whereas bed - next to me - cot seemed a bit more staged for him. 

So basically I’m looking for some advice - 
- tips on how to wean him off using my nipple to fall asleep
- what can I do about the night feeds? Is there any way of ‘tanking him up’ during the day so he won’t feed as much at night?
- should I wean off the nipple and out of my bed all at once - cold turkey? Or am I better doing it in stages where I wean him off nursing to sleep first but let him carry on sleeping with me for comfort, and then when he’s a bit more independent from me get him to sleep in his own bed? I’m not sure whether the drawn out, stages approach is kinder to him or whether I should just bite the bullet, accept a few nights of hell and then he’ll just get used to it?","Nursing to sleep / night feedsMy LO and I have coslept/nursed to sleep since he was born.

Into minute 4 now and she's just gone fully quiet... Maybe a quick breakthrough?!?

Update 2 - She's actually asleep, have snuck out of nursery now. Hopefully that's it for the night!!!

Final update - The night went perfectly, she woke up a couple of times but went back to sleep on her own in minutes, and had a feed at 4am. Seemed to sleep through later than usual too. So wins all round!"

We started sleep training at 4 months (he was born a month premature fwiw but acts like a normal 5 month old as far as milestones are concerned)

Anyways, night sleep is pretty good. Occasionally he'll cry a bit if he's overtired but usually that only lasts 5-10 minutes, and if we catch it right barely at all (BTW I do not rock him to sleep but I do put him on my shoulder to bounce him a bit to sorta calm him down to get ready for bed). He always ""goes to sleep"" on his own from being awake (so hopefully im not effing anything up here)

Naps are a whole different story. He usually naps in his swing (usually 3x a day) but it seems if we are in the room he just cannot nap. We tried doing crib naps when we did night training and it went poorly (We tried for about 2.5 weeks but he was only sleeping like 20 minutes to 40 minutes, and it was usually just making nighttime harder too. PLUS a ton of crying)

Today we tried putting him in his crib and he got a 50 min nap (after some crying) and a 30 min nap (with a lot of crying) and was just SUPER exhausted the entire day making putting him to bed tonight a nightmare (He woke up multiple times tonight crying like every other 5 minutes for about an hour im guessing due to overtiredness). The other thing is he won't nap on us either he resists hardcore.

So I feel like we are stuck. He has a babysitter during the week and he seems to nap better for her but it's like nothing seems to work. Should we just start putting him in his crib completely or what? I worry about the nap association with the swing but he throws such a fit for naps when putting him in the crib (And honestly the screaming is starting to wear me out).","Starting to lose my mind with napsSo our son is 5 months (and maybe a week) old.

My baby is a crap napper (three 30-40min naps on average in her crib) I'm working on trying to get her better but I'm thinking the first place to start is to teach her that naps aren't taken on Mom (these can last 1-2 hrs).

We have not started nighttime sleep training. Per this subs advice we're waiting until after her 4 month regression. She is currently 15 weeks and sleeps like a champ, anyhow. Usually doesn't wake for food until 3am (we feed on demand) and goes down no later than 8pm.

Any constructive advice/critique on pre-training is welcome! Like if I'm wrong to assume this is part of pre-training, lol.

We started a few nights ago, night time has gone great.  Unfortunately night time has never really been an issue, but naps are.  

I’ve had started a modified Ferber (so probably slightly closer to fading since we have a lot of sleep associations to break).  But the issue is our baby wont nap more than one 30 minute nap in his crib, which is way worse than it was before.  

Prior to this we could usually get 1/2 45 minute  or hour and a half long naps in the crib.  Any other naps were me just having to hold and rock him.  

As I said earlier he will only sleep on 30 minute nap in his crib since we started this (admittedly we are only on day 3).  But he is just so tired, like newborn levels of sleepiness, which he hasn’t been since like 6 weeks. 

I ended up caving (cause I am weak) and just holding/rocking him so he could nap.  At this point I am worried that I have now ruined his night time sleep and made it impossible for him to sleep in the crib (if I even try to place him in the crib he starts screaming).  

I’m not really sure how to get him at least napping some in the crib.  Preferably with a gentler method where  there is some more flexibility since he can really only handle 2-3 hours awake at a time.  Prior to this we would put him down calm but awake, and after a couple tries if that didn’t work we would rock him to sleep or just hold him to sleep.

Very fussy as a newborn

EBF

Bedside bassinet

Present:

7 months old

Reverse cycling (only takes around 8oz total plus 2 meals at daycare; is basically hooked onto my boob all night) 

I (mom) don’t respond well to pumping so this suits me but I’m crumbling from exhaustion 

Some supplementing with formula at daycare now 

Nursing to sleep/cuddling to sleep

Starts in her bedside crib, often moves into our bed halfway through night 

Total crap naps at daycare, very unreliable/no schedule (total about 2hrs per day)



Future goals: 

Continue breastfeeding until 1 year

Night wean down to 1-2 feeds per night at most

Move baby’s crib to her own room

End co-sleeping/bedsharing


So... we are clear on our goals but totally lost as to how to get there. I really don’t want to lose supply by moving baby out too soon since we are apart most of the day and I don’t do well with pumping (yes I have done extensive troubleshooting on that)... but it’s time to reclaim our room and our sleep.

However, I got to my wits end. The four month sleep regression hit and I was exhausted. So we started with gentle methods and moved from there. 

We followed Taking Cara Babies 3-4 month guide and slowly weaned her off of negative sleep associations then eventually moved to full extinction when she had gotten good at going to sleep with minimal help. 

We had tried the checks but they only frustrated her. 

Now we put her in her bed fully awake and within 20 minutes (on a bad night, usually just 5-10) of fussing, she’s asleep until 3 am when she wakes to eat and goes right back to sleep.

How to approach night feeds so baby not confused?,sleeptrain,2,cf8chi,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/cf8chi/how_to_approach_night_feeds_so_baby_not_confused/,7,1563575931.0,"TL;DR... If baby wakes at a normal feed time and you're not weaning, do you just go straight to a feed or will this confuse them at other wakings that you apply your chosen ST method? Or is this method specific?

The Details: 

I took the Taking Cara Babies Newborn course and Navigating Months 3-4, and I also read the Happy Sleeper. I haven't officially started using the Sleep Wave or other sleep training yet.

My now almost 5 month old is pretty good at self soothing to sleep at bedtime from the foundations we put in place (dark room, white noise, bedtime routine, etc), and during the night I used hear him wake up, move around for a bit, and fall back asleep. He had stopped waking at except once or twice to feed at predictable times.

Now he's gone through the 4 month sleep regression, waking up more and crying again, but also sometimes seems to be more wanting to play? He's kind of babbling to himself and kicking his legs and such.

Since he's still EBF and young enough that a feed or two at night are developmentally appropriate, I don't want to night wean yet. But I don't know what to do with him waking up more unpredictably. So I'm looking at sleep training.

The Question:

I've read to wait until it's been at least 3 hours before I offer a feed. So I could do the Sleep Wave (or other ST method) if he wakes before that. But when he does wake and it has been 3 hours, do I still try the Sleep Wave first, or go immediately to pick him up, or something in between?

But, it seems like it it keeps getting missed... We have done the sleep training in different rooms. We are NOT sleeping in the same room right now, though we plan on moving back in together in a week or two. 

Am I being impatient? I am so proud of him and the progress he's made so far. He was up every 1-2 hours and it took FOREVER to get him down. Bedtime was beyond frustrating... Now he puts himself to sleep with no tears and only wakes up and fusses a few times a night so this is quite the improvement.

We are down to two night feeds. One around 11:30 and I am working on phasing out the morning one which is around 5 am. 

He is in a crib in our room, 6 months old, and we are sleeping on the floor of the nursery. Our plan is to room share until one year but I don't think us being in the same room during this process will help anyone. Our goal is one more week before we move back in...

He fusses up to 4 times a night, mostly will give one loud yell (loud enough to wake everyone up, thank you son) a few grunts and moans then back to sleep. This morning he fussed for 45 min so I fed him and he's back asleep - this is the longest he's fussed this whole process. 

Of course all babies are different but I would love some input on what others saw in this regard, is this normal and will it last forever? lol

Help with re-sleep training..... a 16 month old?,sleeptrain,3,cf2z6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/cf2z6h/help_with_resleep_training_a_16_month_old/,1,1563539083.0,"So, baby girl is 16 months old (born in March 2018). We initially sleep trained her using Ferber back when she was about 7 months olds- I want to say she went from 2-4 wake ups overnight to just one (not perfect, but much better than we were used to). This new pattern lasted about a week, until she developed her first ear infection last October at about 8 months.  This first infection healed but then lead to another infection and then yet another infection.... I lost count at 7 ear infections from October to February. During this time, we abandoned  sleep training and went back to co-sleeping, since it was the only way any of us were getting \*any\* sleep.

She ended up having ear tubes put in when she was 1 year old this past March. At about 13 months old, we put her back into her nursery on a floor mattress (she absolutely never took to her crib for some reason). Since then, she's had 5 new teeth pop through and hadn't been sleeping well (we're assuming because of the teething?). 

Now, we're finally ready to give sleep training another try. Ideally, we'd like to start trying for another child soon, but she's still waking up about 2-3 times per night, and I have no idea where to begin! Since she's on a floor mattress, she tends to start crying and sometimes crawls towards the nursery door- sometimes we end up accidentally hitting her when we go in to console her haha. She does still use a pacifier, so I'm assuming we need to drop that? She gets a sippy cup of milk with dinner at around 6pm, then we typically start trying to put her to sleep between 7:30-8pm depending on how tired she's acting. She's also started this self-soothing behavior where whenever she's tired, she starts pulling on her earlobes. We've had her checked out by the Dr to rule out more ear infections, so we think it's just a comfort thing that she's used to? But now, she's gone from pulling her own earlobes to pulling ours too whenever we lay down with her- she'll often only fall asleep after holding our ears for awhile. She doesn't really talk yet (other than ""mama"") and she's slightly delayed  developmentally-wise (she's been in physical therapy since she was about 8 months old and isn't walking yet).

Is it too late to break her current sleeping habits? Is there any hope left for us?

He looked dead ass asleep but when I picked him up and latched him I knew I was wrong because his little hand started going crazy grabbing at my shirt, my hair, my lips etc. What he always does when he's awake and feeding. I continued to feed anyways. 

Gave him his paci and put him in bed. He seemed to be sleeping but then suddenly everything turned for the worst.

This was the longest he has cried the whe time we've been doing this. I was watching him on the monitor and he was trying SO HARD to put his paci in. He knows how to do it and Cara says not to put it in for him so I let him keep trying. Bless his little heart he would get it in and then either start rubbing his eyes or slamming his hands. His poor little hands kept betraying him. Every time he would get it in then slam his hands he would pop it out by accident. I think this just kept frustrating him because he started to get hysterical and eventually gave up on putting the paci in and just screamed. This broke my heart and I almost gave in but I didn't want to undo all the effort I had already committed. So, at his last pop-in I put his paci in for him. Little guy instantly fell asleep. 

Side note about his paci: he has 2 that have the little animals attached to them. They are easier for him to find in the night and he is usually pretty good about keeping them in. I've put regular pacis in his bed too and he just has more difficulty both finding them and putting them in. But, as I learned from last night the bigger ones fall out easier if he's thrashing his hands. 

I woke him for the day at 7:15

I am praying night 5 goes better. He is so close. I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.

He knows how to do it and Cara says not to put it in for him so I let him keep trying. Bless his little heart he would get it in and then either start rubbing his eyes or slamming his hands. His poor little hands kept betraying him. Every time he would get it in then slam his hands he would pop it out by accident. I think this just kept frustrating him because he started to get hysterical and eventually gave up on putting the paci in and just screamed. This broke my heart and I almost gave in but I didn't want to undo all the effort I had already committed. So, at his last pop-in I put his paci in for him. Little guy instantly fell asleep. 

Side note about his paci: he has 2 that have the little animals attached to them. They are easier for him to find in the night and he is usually pretty good about keeping them in. I've put regular pacis in his bed too and he just has more difficulty both finding them and putting them in. But, as I learned from last night the bigger ones fall out easier if he's thrashing his hands. 

I woke him for the day at 7:15

I am praying night 5 goes better. He is so close. I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. I feel like each night is a new learning experience about what works for us and what I need to do better at. Stay tuned."

Update: night 3 of Ferber so far,sleeptrain,6,ceindt,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/ceindt/update_night_3_of_ferber_so_far/,12,1563425463.0,"This sub reddit helped me tremendously. So I’ve decided to share our journey as well.

Background: 5 mo baby girl, heavily addicted to pacifier, never slept without it since month 2 (except in a car seat). She normally has one light feed during 3-6am. We want to keep that. But she wakes up like 400 times because pacifier falling out of her mouth. 

4 month sleep regression hits us hard so we decided to sleep train our baby girl. After asking reddit , we put a plan together: we train her nap and night sleep together. 



Night 1: 

went down at 7pm, cried for 50 minutes, slept from 752pm.
Dream feed at 10pm. 
First waking: 2:15am, she rolled for 10 minutes, didn’t cry at all before putting herself back to sleep. I thought she cracked it.
2nd waking: She cried because of hunger. I went in to feed at 4am. She fell asleep after feeding immediately. (She was never fed to sleep, she’s just a sucker baby.) 

3rd waking: 630am. Not ideal as7am, but we settled for that. So I went in to pick her up for the day.

Day 2- 

Nap 1: cried for one solid hour just to sleep for 45 minutes. 

Nap2: cried for 15 minutes before falling asleep for 1 hour.

Nap3: cried for 45 minutes before sleeping for 1 hour 


Unlike many people here, 
Night 2 for us was actually the hardest.

Night 2:
Cried for 1 solid hour before falling asleep at 8pm.

First waking: 10:15 pm, around the time I usually dream feed her. So I fed her immediately.

2nd waking: 415am, this is the hardest. As I forgot to feed her until it went on for 30 minutes of crying. We didn’t want her to have the idea “just need to cry for longer”. I decided we might as well not to go check on her. She finally slept at 530am woke up at 715am. (1h15m of crying)

This was the hardest for us. I almost gave up. But I told my husband we should try for at least 1 week (thanks Reddit) as the results vary for lots of people. 
I believe something magical happened meanwhile... because...

Day 3

Nap 1, nap 2, nap 3:
dang! Took no time at all to fall asleep. Slept for roughly 1 hour each nap.


Night 3: 

Went down at 7:15pm tonight. She didn’t even cry as she went down. She whimpered for 5 minutes then falling asleep. 
1st waking: (the remnant of 4month regression, short sleep cycle) 845pm. She whimpered for literally 1 minute before falling back asleep. 

Instead of gradual improvement, it seems more like a switch, she all of a sudden jumps from 1 solid hour crying to no cry at all to fall asleep. Just makes me realise how important it is to stick to your guns, your plan.

Edit: 
(Night 3) She slept from 7 to 7 (woke up at 7:05am for the day), with a super brief waking for a 5 minute feed at 4:45, no tears. I've slept so much that my boobs hurt as I've gone beyond 7 hours without pumping. :)
She also had a big big smile in the morning when I picked her up. She had so much energy to practise rolling. I'm so so pleased. 

Day 4 naps continue to be good. So I won't update here.

19 week old nonstop rolling onto stomach and hysterically crying,sleeptrain,2,cemkfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/cemkfi/19_week_old_nonstop_rolling_onto_stomach_and/,4,1563445830.0,"I apologize if this is just word vomit, I haven’t slept more than an hour at a time in weeks. 

So we’ve tried and failed to sleep train our 19 week old based on conflicting feelings as to if he was ready or not. We’ve had a bedtime routine (bath, massage, sound machine, dark room, read a book) since he was 2 weeks old. He used to be swaddled and we never rocked him or anything. He would just be placed in his crib with a pacifier and immediately fall asleep on his own. Then he started rolling back to belly and did so in his swaddle. We decided to try weaning the swaddle, but after him rolling back to belly, we got scared and went cold turkey. That was two and a half weeks ago. Since then, bedtime is nothing but screaming, soaked sheets from tears and sleep deprivation for all of us. He no longer naps or sleeps easy. He won’t stay on his back and immediately flips over and starts screaming hysterically. Here’s what we’ve tried:

Rolling him back over again and again (leads to even more frustration for all of us and doesn’t work).

 Just repeatedly giving him his pacifier and trying to soothe him with butt pats and back rubs (works 10% of the time, completely at random). 

Letting him cry and checking on him (this lead to pure bloody murder cries). Because of the screaming bloody murder, I eventually cave and go pick him up until he calms down and try to put him to sleep again. The second he realizes he’s being put down, he works himself back up again. I’m at a loss now because he seems traumatized (if that’s even possible) by even being in the crib. We can’t get him to sleep more than an hour at a time, he just wakes up screaming. We can’t tell if he’s ready to even be sleep trained or if he’s too young. He doesn’t eat throughout the night, just during the day.

Woke up 3 times to eat (breastfed). The next night it also took her close to 20 minutes, but then she only woke up twice at 12am & 4am to nurse (which is AMAZING for her). Since then she takes less than 10 minutes to fall asleep at the start of the night, but is waking up every 2 hours by the time we go to bed, and after 3am more frequently than that 😩. I try to wait minimally 10-20 minutes before going to nurse her because I would think she should be able to self soothe sooner than that?? Idk. Should we just really be ignoring her for literally as long as it takes? My husband and I are at our wits end and I am TIRED.

We started sleeping training because her night sleeping patterns were so inconsistent despite sticking to a pretty regular, age-appropriate nap schedule. Also, I live with anxiety/depression so lack of sleep is really hard on my mental state. Really any insight is greatly appreciated!"

How to sleep train a serial vomiter,sleeptrain,6,ce3anl,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/ce3anl/how_to_sleep_train_a_serial_vomiter/,11,1563341099.0,"Sorry for the messy post, I'm a tad sleep deprived!

So our 11mo son has been nap trained for six months now with no issues, two naps a day totalling no more than 3hrs. Wakes from the last one at 4pm and bedtime at 8pm. 

At nighttime however, he's always been fed to sleep because he refuses to drink his milk any other way. Previously if he finished his milk and was still awake, most of the time we could lie him down and he would put himself to sleep. We've tried lots of different things to break the association but nothing works, however, he would usually fall asleep fine and has been sttn on and off (mostly off) since 2 months. 

At 8mo, he went through a terrible sleep regression to the point that he would throw up the entire contents of his stomach if left to cry for more than a few minutes. This meant that we couldn't let him cio anymore. This has continued for months now and he now throws up after his night bottle almost every night, which requires lights on, changing clothes etc and thus an awake baby that takes another hour to put to sleep.  He has also fallen into the habit of being held and rocked to sleep only and has started waking in the night and demanding to be held til he's COMPLETELY asleep), even when we think he's fast asleep, he wakes right up the moment we stand up with him. It's gotten so bad that we will have to hold him for over an hour occasionally. 

My husband and I both work and are completely frazzled and at a loss. We can't let him cio because he'll throw up, but he's getting spoilt and developing terrible sleep associations as a result of this. We're so tired and in desperate need of some guidance or someone to tell us that this is normal and that he'll grow out of it??!","How to sleep train a serial vomiterSorry for the messy post, I'm a tad sleep deprived!

*Warning: long post! I tried to be brief, but I also wanted to include enough detail about how things have gone to be helpful.*

So, it has been about a week and a half since I last posted an update on how our sleep training journey was going with our super-attached 8 month old girl. I’ve had a couple people ask me how it has been going since those first two weeks, so I thought it might be worthwhile providing an update to share how things look nearly a month after starting.

**NIGHTS**

In some ways it is all a blur and I don’t want to bog the post down with an insane amount of detail, which I could easily do if I used all my app info! But basically, night times have gotten a lot better. She doesn’t get as upset throughout the bedtime routine. And a couple of times, she didn’t even cry when I laid her down and left the room! So that has been a definite sign of progress. She often settles within a few mins, although there are still some nights where it takes her 10-15m. She almost never wakes up through the night and if she does, it is a mini cry and she just goes back to sleep.

Our issue started to become her early wake-ups. She would often get upset around 3:30-4:30a. And then again from 4:30a - 5:30a. It was so hard to hear her so upset at this hour. We were exhausted, and, at the risk of sounding ungrateful about her bedtime progress, it was starting to feel like it was negating the bedtime wins. Because she was just *so upset* in the mornings. Often she woke up with a dirty diaper, so for awhile, we thought that was all it was. We tried to leave her crying for a little if it looked like she would soothe, but that didn’t feel right either. Seems a harsh way to start every day. We finally decided to introduce a dreamfeed. Our girl had weaned herself off night feeds awhile ago, so it took us awhile to realize that maybe she is hungry when she is waking up. It seems so obvious now, but it didn’t initially. So we introduced a dreamfeed 3 nights ago. The first night, she slept until 7AM!! If you knew our girl, you would know how amazing this is. But the following two mornings, she has still woken up early, but it has at least been after 5am. The second night/morning she woke after 5am, but babbled in her crib for 35m before getting upset. Definitely an improvement. The third night/morning (this morning) she woke at 5:40a and was upset. But she could have woke earlier and been babbling and neither of us heard it. So, definite progress again. I wish we could get her to sleep until at least 6am, but anything after 5:30a seems reasonable. We are going to continue the dreamfeed and hope that it continues to help her sleep longer in the morning.

Throughout all of this, she has been transitioning from 3 naps to 2, so her daytime schedule has varied. On top of that, she has 5-6 teeth trying to break through at the same time. She is a warrior for doing this good!! I am so proud of her.

**NAPS**

We started naps 5 days ago, so we have done naps for 4 full days. We didn’t want to start with both at the same time, because she had such a rough time with nights that none of us could deal with it. Prior to nap training, she slept in my arms (exclusively) for ALL naps. I was DREADING starting naps. DREADING. The last time I tried to get her to nap independently was a disaster—she cried so hard she vomited. But it was time to try, as I need to have some time to myself during the day.

Naps have gone, for the most part, WAY better than I was expecting. Some days she has needed 3 naps, because she has gotten up too early and not napped long enough to only have 2 naps. She has slept for over an hour a couple times, which is a massive win, as it means she has connected sleep cycles on her own. But a lot of the time, it is just one sleep cycle (\~ 40m). I am trying to remember that the initial goal is not long naps, but *independent* naps. And for all but one nap, she has gone down, by herself in under 10mins. Amazing! My husband is currently working from home, so we’ve been alternating who puts her down for her naps too. We have implemented a mini pre-nap routine that pulls from her bedtime routine to help signal sleep time. I’ve ended up holding her for the second sleep cycle of her second nap, because I don’t want her to be overtired for bed and I don’t want to have to put her to bed before her bedtime, as her bedtime is currently 6:30p. So if she doesn’t get a long enough nap, I don’t want to have to put her down at 5:30p or keep her up for over 4 hours. I’m ok with this for now, but I don’t know if I should be holding out longer to see if she self-settles? Should I leave it longer than 10mins to see if she gets back to sleep? I would leave it 30mins before she had napped at all, but I am worried that if she has had a 40m nap, she won’t fall back asleep in 30mins. Any advice is appreciated.

For those who are interested in the details, here’s the rundown:

**DAY 1:** Nap 1 — asleep in 10m, slept for 37m

Nap 2 — asleep in 8m, slept for 1hr 26m

Nap 3 — asleep in 7m, slept for 14m

**DAY 2:** Nap 1 — asleep in 2.5m, slept for 57m

Nap 2 — asleep in 15m, slept for 42m. \*I then went and grabbed her because she didn’t fall back asleep within 5mins. I held her for a 46m nap.

**DAY 3:** Nap 1 — asleep in 5m, slept for 42m

Nap 2 — asleep in 2m, slept for 42m \*I then went and grabbed her because she didn’t fall back asleep within 5mins. I held her for a 50m nap.

**DAY 4:** Nap 1 — asleep in 10.5m, slept for 40m

Nap 2 — asleep in 18m, slept for 1hr 7m

Nap 3 — DISASTER! Wouldn’t soothe. Hysterical crying even when I held her. Took nearly 45m of rocking to get her to sleep and held her for a 40m nap.

I hope this is helpful to other parents! Overall, I am very grateful we started sleep training. We definitely haven’t really hit that sweet spot you read about, where the baby just sleeps 12 hours through the night and wakes up happy. It is still hard to hear her cry, especially in the morning. It is still a rollercoaster and we are still trying to figure how naps and how to get her to not wake so early. But she is self-soothing, going to sleep by herself, my husband and I have our bed back, I have my nights back, and I have a couple of hours a day (usually) where I can do my own thing. Before doing sleep training, I never thought this could happen.","UPDATE 16: Ferber/CIO--life since night 14 (early wake up issues, dreamfeeds) + naps update&#x200B;

When to unswaddle?,sleeptrain,1,ce6mbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/ce6mbg/when_to_unswaddle/,6,1563358258.0,"The title is a bit misleading.

Our second child is 13 weeks. Now, I’ve heard that unswaddling should happen when she rolls from belly to back. She’s already doing that, but is inconsistent with it.

So...which is it? Unswaddle when they roll belly or back, or back to belly? I thought rolling back to belly was harder than belly to back. To me, belly to back uses muscles and gravity (easier) while belly to back uses a larger range of muscles (harder). 

Note: this thought of which is easier is purely my opinion, not a scientific standpoint.

Our second kiddo just turned 4 months last week, and I still have no idea what I'm doing.  I think I blocked out the sleep deprivation and any sleep training trauma from our first because I honestly cannot remember how he slept as a baby.  We are doing the CARA Babies 3-4 month ""program"" (really, it's just a booklet with steps to minimize intervention) but I feel like we just switched one sleep prop (rocking or nursing) for another (the pacifier).  The first few nights, he did great, slept a longer stretch, and he still will sometimes put himself to sleep at bedtime without fussing or the relying on the paci (SOMETIMES). However, the past few nights, he's been waking every couple of hours, and none of the steps work until you get to the pacifier, and then he'll settle down and go back to sleep, but wakes up again after 2 hours or so, when the paci is out.  Rinse, repeat. We have not had any luck replacing it with a lovey.

She turned 16 weeks today so I've been googling/youtubing/redditing swaddle transition for a while. We're doing swaddle to sleep sack transition with one arm at the time. Started tonight by taking her right arm out and usually I sing a song, rock her for a minute and put her down awake and leave the room but today I stayed for a minute to keep my hand on her belly and shushing a bit because our prior attempts with one arm out were less than great. I tried a couple of times for naps and she would keep knocking her paci out and upseting herself. Then I remembered Cara from Taking Cara Babies that night sleep is concored prior to naps so we are starting with nights. I plan on doing 4-5 nights with one arm, than 4-5 with both arms but swaddled under her armpits and then introduce sleep sack.
Usually she wakes up around 2am and 5am to eat so wish us luck.","Swaddle transition - let's do this!So swaddle transition has been creaping on us for a few weeks when she started rolling on her sides and today she finally rolled to her belly.

I’m looking for advice or any wisdom on sleep training our 6.5 month old. 

First, we co-sleep and we still hold her for naps. And before any criticism starts, this is not what we expected as parents. From birth she hated sleeping on her back, alone. We never got more than 10 minutes without having to hold her to get her to sleep.  It wasn’t until at 1.5 months, I fell asleep snuggling her in our bed after feeding her that we realized she wanted to sleep in our bed, cuddled with us. (THANKFULLY NOTHING BAD HAPPENED) Both me and babygirl sleep like rocks and don’t move all night so it works. But now that we can sleep train, I’d like to stay up past 9pm and be able to put her down for naps and bedtime. 

I’m afraid we’re going to really struggle with this because she’s been so dependent on us for all of her sleeping needs. Should we start sleep training for bedtime or just for naps or both? Is there any wisdom anyone would like to share? 

Thanks!!

Edit: I wanted to add that if she realizes we’re not holding her or within arms reach, she’ll start tossing around until she wakes herself up. It’s like she needs to know we’re within arms distance and our bodies can touch. Helpppppoo","Help/advice as we begin to sleep train our 6.5 month oldBuckle up folks, this one is a doozy...

We are planning on sleep training next week. (Going away this coming weekend, planning on starting when we get back Sunday night.) How do you reccomend we sleep train while room sharing? Here are a couple facts: 

1. Crib is right by our bed. LO can't see me because of where the corner of the crib is. 
2. We pretty much live in our room. We rent the upstairs from my mother, we had a nursery but unfortunately my SIL just passed away very suddenly and we had to clear out the nursery for my brother and his son for when they stay here. So there's not really anywhere for us to go while LO is falling asleep. Plus we both work so we normally go to bed probably 45 mins or so after the baby (8:00 bedtime for LO)
3. Ideally, we would like him to be able to fall asleep in his crib while DH and I are sitting on our bed watching TV (volume low, lights off.) Where the crib is  LO doesn't really get any light from the TV. 
4. We'd like to do Ferber. 
5. We do have the option to sleep on my brothers bed for a few nights while we sleep train but I don't want that to get screwed up when we go back into the room. Like I said, the goal for us is for him to be able to fall asleep with us quietly in the room. 
6. We currently are rocking to sleep and placing in the crib. He is going through a regression so it's taking forever. We have to do the process at least twice every night. 

I'm open to any and all ideas! Thanks in advance!!","Room Sharing and Sleep Training!Hello parents. We are planning on sleep training next week.

I’m leaning toward full extinction because this baby needs is a bit more attached to me and I feel my presence will only upset him further and make sleep training longer and harder than it needs to be.

We’ve tried to eliminate that one wake up with no success, but feel it’ll go away once solids are a bit better. However, over the weekend she has started waking up at 4:30 or 5 and refusing to go back to sleep even with a feeding.

And then, of course, everyone on here has a different age that they chose to start. Some start at 4.5 months and were successful, while others weren’t. Some waited until much later and were easily able to do it.

I was hoping to try and sleep train him while we room share, but his dad is so loud sometimes (unintentionally), that I don’t think it’s going to be possible. That would mean waiting until 6 months when we move him to his crib in his own room, as per the AAP’s recommendation.

Night 3 was.. brutal. We put her down at 7:15 and she fell asleep by 7:35. Great right? Then she woke up at 8:45 absolutely distraught. We let her cry for 30 minutes to see if she'd put herself back to sleep and then she stress pooped. We changed her and put her down again and she seemed like she was going to sleep after 20 minutes and then she started screaming again. We went in and she kept shoving her hand into her mouth and chewing, so we assumed it was her teeth again. We gave her some relief and then she fell asleep 20 minutes after we gave it to her around 10:15pm. She then woke up at midnight, we fed her because her last bottle was at 6pm so I figured she was hungry. She drank 5oz and fell asleep in 5minutes after I put her back in her crib. She woke up again at 2am, hubby picked her up and she fell asleep as soon as he picked her up and he put her back down. She then woke up at 5:30 and was babbling and sounding like she was up for the day. 

&#x200B;

I'm really starting to feel bad about sleep training while her first teeth are about to erupt. I don't want to stop now as she does seem to be falling asleep on her own pretty easily.

What age did you start sleep training ?,sleeptrain,3,ccsb8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/ccsb8v/what_age_did_you_start_sleep_training/,8,1563069704.0,"Most information seems to say that sleep training shouldn’t take place before 6 months as most babies cannot handle it. LO is 4 months old this week. I think we are into the 4 month sleep regression and I am struggling. LO has been a terrible sleeper since about 1 month old so it’s hard to say when it actually started but all I know is, he only has 30 min day naps and wakes every 1-2 hours at night. 

Plus we really struggle with the whole drowsy but awake thing and we usually have to hold him till in a deep sleep before we can transfer to the bassinet. Although we have made some progress with this for day naps. We have no chance at night.

Just wondering when we can start trying to sleep train I don’t want to do it before he is ready but we also need some sleep, we are going mad.","What age did you start sleep training ?Most information seems to say that sleep training shouldn’t take place before 6 months as most babies cannot handle it.

"Gearing up for sleep training, need advice and support",sleeptrain,1,ccqcfx,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/ccqcfx/gearing_up_for_sleep_training_need_advice_and/,4,1563059270.0,"My son is a few days shy of 4 months, so me and my husband want to get our ducks in a row with a plan so we can start once we get the ok from our pediatrician (we likely will wait till next weekend since we have the four month shots and he had some tummy trouble after his 2 month shots).

I am struggling to figure out what would work best for us, and am admittedly week.  I flip flop between wanting something that will be quick in terms of how many days before he starts sleeping better, and a more gentle approach.  This is heavily influenced by how much I get woken up at night.

Until about 3.5 months he slept great overnight, with a single waking between 3-4 am.  However since than we have had a host of issues.  He now wakes up around 1 am to feed, but usually doesn’t end up eating a full meal.  He also won’t settle back to sleep at that time, for up to an hour.  He also has been waking multiple times through the night from breaking out of his swaddle (more on that bellow).

So we do still swaddle him, as he still has some startle reflex left.  But more because he will wake himself up by shoving his hands in face/ears/mouth. 

We already try to put him down calm but awake, after a nap/bed time routine that is consistent.  It works about half the time.  

We have also tried the shush pats to calm him when he does fuss, with zero success. He just seems to get frustrated that you are there but not picking him up. 

Finally he does sleep in his crib, in his own room (has since 2 months).

Should we drop the swaddle before sleep training? Or can we do them at the same time?
Would something like CIO be better suited to him since the second he sees one of us he just wants to be social (even if we avoid looking at or interacting with  him).
Also I am a bit confused as to how you do sleep training when the baby still requires a middle of the night feed (since at least when it was between 3-4 am he would eat a full meal).

Any tips, or help on preparing for it and actually doing it would be much appreciated.  I have already read through the recommended resources, and googled stuff a ton during sleep issues I’m just not sure how to determine what will work best, and I need to get back to sleeping since it’s typically just me at home with the baby.","Gearing up for sleep training, need advice and supportMy son is a few days shy of 4 months, so me and my husband want to get our ducks in a row with a plan so we can start once we get the ok from our pediatrician (we likely will wait till next weekend since we have the four month shots and he had some tummy trouble after his 2 month shots).

Is this a good plan? Making unpredictable night feeds predictable,sleeptrain,1,ccpsxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/ccpsxy/is_this_a_good_plan_making_unpredictable_night/,4,1563056175.0,"- 19 week old baby (4.5 months)
- EBF
- Consistent 8pm bedtime and routine
- Falls asleep independently at bedtime
- No other schedule to speak of, for naps or for feeding.
- I try to feed often during the day, but can’t tell how much since I’m breastfeeding
- Wakes up at night to feed every 3 hours or so, but the times are wildly unpredictable. She likes to throw curveballs by waking up after 2.5 hours sometimes. Can go up to 4 hours.
- Pees and poops a lot overnight so I can tell she ate a lot
- Tried to space out feeds 1 and 2, but the crying was too much to deal with in the middle of the night.

So now my goal is to just get the night feeds into a more predictable pattern. I’ve resigned to the frequent night feeds, I just think it will be a lot less demoralizing if I know when they will happen. I‘m going back to work in a week, so dad will take over some night feeds.

Plan:

- Lights out 8pm
- Dream feed 10pm (breast)
- Morning feed 6:30am (breast)
- I will respond to any MOTN feeds, but I will pop her off after 2 minutes each side. If dad is giving a bottle, he’ll do 2 oz. max.
- If she is clearly not settled we’ll go ahead and give her more.

Mainly I am hoping that once we start doing “bookend” feeds at 10pm and 6:30am, a more predictable MOTN pattern will emerge. Is this at all a reasonable expectation? I don’t want to set us up for disappointment. 

I’ve also never done a dream feed or proactively woke her up to feed before, so I’m nervous about that. Any stories from people who do proactive night feeds would be appreciated. Thank you!","Is this a good plan? Making unpredictable night feeds predictable- 19 week old baby (4.5 months)

Baby is 6.5 months. Did full extinction at 4.5 months. Baby usually goes down great and sleeps through the night. She had been waking up between 7 & 8, which is perfect for us. But the past week or so she's been waking up between 6 & 6:30.

It's obviously not a huge deal but I would like her to sleep a little later, if possible.

Things we've tried:

A later bedtime

An earlier betime

Longer awake times with two naps a day

Shorter awake times with three naps a day

Nursing in the very early morning hours

The only thing I haven't tried is leaving her until the desired wake time and the reason for that is she wakes up so happy. She isn't crying or screaming, just chatting and babbling to herself in her crib. I don't want to leave her because I'm afraid that it will turn into crying and screaming and instead of my happy morning cuddles I'll have a miserable, angry baby on my hands. 

But I'm guessing that might be the solution?

To see other nights go to my username history.

We put her down at 7:10p and she fell asleep by 7:40p. She woke up at 10:20p absolutely wailing! Complete hysteria. Let her cry for 15 minutes checking in at 10minutes and then picked her up to console her because her cries were obviously from pain (she’s been teething). We gave her some medicine and held her and she fell asleep after 30minutes. We put her back in the crib and she didn’t wake up until 4:30a. We gave her 4oz and she fell back asleep after 5 minutes of mild wailing (almost sounds like Dory’s whale calls). She woke up at 6:45a. 

Sorry for the late update. I’m glad we’re able to evaluate her cries, her gums were so swollen and her cheeks were so red. Her tooth is so close to cutting. I feel bad sleep training her during such a difficult time :( 

This feels a lot like when we tried to sleep train when we bed shared but decided to stop until we got our crib - the first few nights were really good and then they got really bad.","Update: Night 2 FerberNight 2

We put her down at 7:10p and she fell asleep by 7:40p. She woke up at 10:20p absolutely wailing! Complete hysteria. Let her cry for 15 minutes checking in at 10minutes and then picked her up to console her because her cries were obviously from pain (she’s been teething). We gave her some medicine and held her and she fell asleep after 30minutes. We put her back in the crib and she didn’t wake up until 4:30a. We gave her 4oz and she fell back asleep after 5 minutes of mild wailing (almost sounds like Dory’s whale calls). She woke up at 6:45a. 

Sorry for the late update. I’m glad we’re able to evaluate her cries, her gums were so swollen and her cheeks were so red. Her tooth is so close to cutting. I feel bad sleep training her during such a difficult time :(

Waits til we come in to lie down. How to break?,sleeptrain,2,cck951,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/cck951/waits_til_we_come_in_to_lie_down_how_to_break/,1,1563014775.0,"Soo,

18mo was previously sleeping through with about a minute of crying when we put him down. Now we are trying to retrain him but he stays awake until we come into the room then instantly lies down and tries to go to sleep. If we stay there 15 sec he would sleep but if we leave straight away he gets up again and waits until we come in again.

We come in to check in on him at progressively increasing intervals .

Any idea how to break this need for us to come in??","Waits til we come in to lie down. How to break?Soo,

Our plan- how does it sound?,sleeptrain,2,cchxi6,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/cchxi6/our_plan_how_does_it_sound/,10,1563000960.0,"This subreddit has been super helpful for me and my husband to figure out our method of sleep training our daughter. We're officially going for it tomorrow night. And I was hoping to get any suggestions on improvements to our plan. 

We're taking a three phased approach:

Phase 1- break the nursing association and move to crib. During this phase we are also going to hold off on feeding her for at least 6 hours. This is what she would average before her regression, so I know she can do it. Then we'll feed every 3 hours afterward.  She's currently in a bassinet next to our bed and is nursed  to sleep, so this will be the biggest transition. We're planning to do extinction, but my husband is a softy so if she gets real worked up we'll go in at intervals of 10m.

Phase 2- gradually night wean. We plan to get to this when it feels right. Probably about a month or so after initial training to see how the night feedings have regulated themselves. 

Phase 3- wean from Merlin suit. We'll do this when she is trying to roll in the suit. It may happen before phase 2 if that's how things pan out.

I know this will be rough but she's totally capable of doing this and so are we. Any good vibes would help though!

Edit: she's just over 4 months. 19weeks.","Our plan- how does it sound?This subreddit has been super helpful for me and my husband to figure out our method of sleep training our daughter.

Nap length,sleeptrain,7,cbwmbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/cbwmbm/nap_length/,7,1562886252.0,"Hello, all!

We decided to sleep train our 4 month old last week, and the results have been fabulous. She was always a great sleeper, but she just needed that extra push to ditch some lingering sleep props and learn to self soothe more consistently. She's taken to it very well, and though we're still crying a bit before naps and night sleep, she never goes longer than 2-3 minutes. I'm thinking that's just her normal so I'm not worried about it.

One of the main benefits we've enjoyed is that she's no longer waking at the 39 minute mark for naps and crying to be picked up. The second day we trained her, she slept for 2 whole hours and woke up super pleasant. She hasn't done that since she was 6 weeks old, so we were understandably thrilled.

My question is this: we have a Nest cam in her room and regularly check up on her while she's sleeping. I've noticed that she does still wake up at the 39 minute mark, but instead of crying, she puts her hands in her mouth, hangs out in tummy time for a minute or two, and lays back down. She looks like she's falling back asleep, but she seems to be moving a bit still? I honestly can't tell, but her eyes are closed and she usually lays there until the 90 minute or two hour mark.

I've got a 9 month old who sleeps great for his 2 (1.5hr) naps a day.

Our issue is night sleeping. We have a small 1 bedroom apartment, so we room share but he is in his crib. I feel like I've tried everything with him, but still at the very beginning of the night he wakes every 45 mins until about 11pm.

Generally he sleeps from 7:30pm on and off until about 11pm. Then he'll have a long stretch until about 5:30-6am, then will go back down until 8 or 8:30. His naps are always the same, and he goes down easy. He naps at 10:30 until noon, then again at 3pm to 4:30pm.

We've tried so much with sleep training. We did 11 days trying cio, then the chair method, pick up/put down and even extinction for 6 days. We've been trying multiple methods since he was 6 months old. Every single time he cries, he gags a lot. Lots of spit/saliva and wet tears. Two times after coughing and gagging, he went silent and we checked the monitor - he was choking. Husband went in there and had to pick him up and hold him so he would breathe again.

We've mentioned this to our doctor and they said that basically some babies just never sleep well. I've also worked with a sleep trainer/coach, and she insists we keep trying, but I'm scared for his health at this point.

I just want him to be able to go to sleep without nursing/rocking and crossing our fingers a transfer is successful.

Two times after coughing and gagging, he went silent and we checked the monitor - he was choking. Husband went in there and had to pick him up and hold him so he would breathe again.

We've mentioned this to our doctor and they said that basically some babies just never sleep well. I've also worked with a sleep trainer/coach, and she insists we keep trying, but I'm scared for his health at this point.

I just want him to be able to go to sleep without nursing/rocking and crossing our fingers a transfer is successful.

Has anyone else dealt with some choking scares and still had success with sleep training? What method worked for you?"

He can easily scream for two hours some nights, other nights it is as little as a half an hour. No matter what, he always wakes at 10:30 and screams. Sometimes he shakes the crib. Sometimes he just sits there. It is so bad he sounds like he is going to vomit.

It has been months he has been doing this. We have tried everything. We have tried to do comforting. He doesn’t want to be comforted. We have tried checks, it does nothing. Leaving him to cry he will just go on and on.

But lately he WON'T sleep well in travel crib/outside of house. Sleep train all over again for the travel crib??

I haven’t posted in a while as we successfully sleep trained our little boy (almost 7 months, we trained him at 4.5 months). We basically did cry-it-out and it worked. Now he sleeps from about 6pm – 6am pretty steadily and when at home he takes regular naps with at least one reliably 1.5-2 hour long nap.

A recent problem: he will NOT nap well elsewhere. That’s a given for daycare and it sucks but we can’t afford a nanny so we live with it. But lately he won’t go down for naps anywhere. We were at a friend’s and we put him down in their baby’s nursery in the travel crib—no dice, crying until we got him. He had always slept well at his grandma’s, on the bed which he loved, but now that he rolls over the bed isn’t an option so he’s in the travel crib, and two failed attempts today, screaming for 20-30 minutes until his grandma just got him up. These rooms aren’t as dark as his nursery but you know, we pull the shades and make it as sleep-conducive as possible for him.

He sleeps perfectly in his nursery at home, for naps and night-time. We’re scheduled to spend the weekend out of town and I’m dreading it. So, my question: should we TRAIN him to sleep A) in his travel crib and B) in a place that ISN’T his nursery? I’m just seeing the same pre-sleep training behavior we used to see at home: crying for 30 minutes before sleeping for a nap, fighting sleep when he really really needs it, etc. My brain is telling me he has mastered the skill of sleeping at home because we’ve TRAINED him to do it, so we should probably do him (and us) a favor and TRAIN him (ie, do cry-it-out) to sleep in other locations in his travel crib. Right? Has anyone done this??

For those who say that they have sleep trained and their little one is now sleeping through is that because you went cold turkey on night feeds as well?  I dont feel comfortable weaning her yet so I’m just curious if sleeping through will just come with the training in regards to going to bed initially by herself or in order for her to sleep through I need to wean her from her feedings.  I hope this makes sense!"

We're now about a week in and having a new issue. She learned to roll on her stomach recently, but she's not always consistent about rolling back the other way. She can do it and has for over a month, but for some reason, she doesn't always want do it? She seems to prefer crying at us until we do it for her. Lazy baby!

Anyway, I know Ferber says to roll them once and then leave them if they roll again, but how long do you keep this practice up? She rolls right back almost every time, and has now begun sleeping on her stomach for every nap. Do we just...leave her permanently now? I feel like flipping her back is resulting in more crying.","Stomach rolling and FerberSo we just started sleep training our 4 month old daughter, and things are going really well.

Sleep issues with 12 mo old... any insight appreciated.,sleeptrain,3,cac5al,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/cac5al/sleep_issues_with_12_mo_old_any_insight/,1,1562563231.0,"Hi all, looking for any insight into what we are doing wrong if anything, or some solidarity if nothing else. Our (nearly) 12 month old is down to two naps, and sleeps through the night most nights. However some days and nights, several times a week at least, she wakes up screaming... this is either super early from one or both of her naps, or at some point during the nights. Sometimes she goes back to sleep on her own, but often not. 

If she wakes up screaming at night and doesn’t go back to sleep after 5-10 minutes, we comfort her, give her a bottle, redo the bedtime routine, and she goes back to sleep. If she wakes up early from a nap and won’t go back down, I just accept defeat and move up the next nap or bedtime. This causes problems though because it results in the earlier shifting of her schedule and often early morning waking because of it. 

I don’t know why this screaming happens. Sometimes I think it’s teething so I give her Tylenol. Sometimes I think she’s overtired so I will put her down earlier than usual. But no matter what I try it seems it still keeps happening. It’s starting to really wear me down when she does this. Any advice? Or is this normal for this age? Thanks for reading.

EDIT to add... she goes to sleep independently with no sleep associations. We have nap and bedtime routines and put her down awake, and she falls asleep on her own within 5-10 minutes usually with not much crying.","Sleep issues with 12 mo old... any insight appreciated.Hi all, looking for any insight into what we are doing wrong if anything, or some solidarity if nothing else.

So now, two months later, my partner is pressuring me to try CIO again.

Just Moved And Need To Sleep Train Toddler!,sleeptrain,1,ca3vxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/ca3vxf/just_moved_and_need_to_sleep_train_toddler/,0,1562509857.0,"We just moved today to a 3 bedroom 2 bath apartment and we need to begin sleep training our 21month old (19.5 adjusted). It was very hard to do in our 1B1B and we both work full time so we have been to exhausted to try. Now that we have a much bigger place we want to start the process. She has her own room, and a playroom. Today we started by having her nap in the playroom and sleeping in her new room. However she didn’t go to sleep until about 12am.

She is a bit of a night owl and doesn’t go to sleep easy before 9pm. She is very good about putting herself to sleep. She will grab her blanket and go plop down and go to sleep. In the 1B1B we did kind of a Montessori floor sleep type of arrangement on a custom day care style mat that was very thick. She loves it. Even when we used her crib she hated it and would easily climb out and hurt herself if I trued to use one. Should I put her in a toddler bed or put a mattress on the floor since she’s use to it? 

If she did wake up at night, she would get in our bed. I’d say she 50/50 either stayed on her mat or got in our bed. She does get bad dreams I think when she gets in our bed because she will be trembling and sobbing until she snuggles with me. She takes about 2 hourish nap everyday that she cannot go with out. On the weekends she would sleep until 10 if I let her, but usual time I wake her up is about 8-8:30am.

Another important note is she on several medications. Citrizine, pulmacort, and albuteral in the am. Albuteral in the pm but I try and have it done by 7 because it makes her hyper. If she’s having a bad respiratory day it’s albuteral every 4 hours. Somewhat regular use of Benadryl as advised by pediatrician for severe outdoor allergies. I don’t like giving her Benadryl (we use a half dose), but since we have started she’s gone down from 3-5 respiratory infections per month to just 1. It doesn’t seem to make her tired though, which I found surprising because it knocks me out. She was a premie and has had some pretty rough respiratory issues. I’d like to avoid CICO if I can because I think it will exacerbate her lung issues. 

Any suggestions on where we should start??

I have a 5 month old.  I can't complain because he's always been a wonderful sleeper since he was about 8 weeks old or so.  At 3.5 months, we seemed to have hit the dreaded regression, so we started Ferber.  He responded to it fairly well, and no longer woke up in the night.  We didn't keep up the method after about 2 weeks because he was going down easy, and sleeping 7pm to 7am most nights.  Occasionally he'd wake up and want his pacifier, but I didn't have to do anything but put it back in. Not an issue. 

Over time, his wake-up time has started getting earlier and earlier. Over the past several weeks, l he has started waking up around 4am.  The paci doesn't satisfy him.  At that point it's been 8 hours since his last bottle.  So I make a bottle and feed him in the dark. I lay him back down drowsy and he sleeps until 7ish.   He has also begun crying again at bedtime.  I haven't been letting him cry it out though, I've just been patting his bottom or letting him hold my hand to expedite the process.  But I wonder if it's hurting our routine and causing more crying in the long run.

I'd love to drop this 4am bottle, and for bedtime to be easier again.  I have trouble getting back to sleep after his wake-up  and I'm getting pretty exhausted.   Do I need to repeat Ferber? Or is there some tweaking I can do, maybe, to make things easier?

UPDATE 14 & 15: Ferber/CIO Nights 13 & 14..

I didn't update on the night before (which was the first night after our ""dream night""), so here are both updates.

&#x200B;

**NIGHT 13**

It didn’t seem like bedtime clicked in for her, as she didn't get upset when Dad did his goodnight. Could have been a sign of progress, but it felt more like she wasn't fully aware. Fell asleep in 18m, but with bouts of hysterical crying. She was up at 5:25a quietly sitting. By 5:30a, hysterical tears. I went in to do a check and didn't smell a poop, so I put her back (I can *always* smell her poop). But her crying was so bad until 5:45a, that I got her up and, you know what--there was poop. I guess I don't always smell it then. She still slept most of the night though and clocked about 10hr 37m.  


**NIGHT 14 (4th July)**

She had a good bedtime and even though she cried when Dad did his goodnight, she was trying to soothe even while he was leaving. She only cried after I went to walk away from laying her down in the crib. This has *never* happened yet. She always cries as soon as she leaves my arms or I lay her in the crib. It took her 10 mins to fall asleep.

After that though, it was a horrible night for her. At around 9:50p, right around the time Independence Day fireworks started letting off, she was up. And it was hysterical crying. She would try and soothe and then sit back up. Part of me wondered if this was her extinction burst, but the timing with the fireworks seemed hard to ignore. At around 10:30p or so, Dad went in to comfort her, but she was still pretty hysterical. I came in and she stopped crying when I held her and then we just sat in the rocking chair and I soothed her while the fireworks were going off. Her eyes were open a lot of the time, like she was still on edge. But she eventually fell asleep in my arms. I mistakenly thought the fireworks were over, and as soon as I went to lay her down in her crib, one close by went off and she was hysterical again. I still left the room, although it was very hard to do so. I was so confused and worried, because I wanted to comfort her, but I wasn't sure I wasn't thwarting our training. It was emotionally draining. She was up on and off until 11:40p with hysterical crying. She woke up crying at 3:30a, but soothed in 10mins. Then was up at 5:30a. Her crying was hysterical again, so I did a poop check, but I didn't smell any, but then I didn't trust myself after yesterday so I did a diaper change. It was just wet. Put her back...more hysterical crying for 10mins. She laid back down and I thought she would get another 30-45mins, but nope, she woke up in 10mins (hysterical) and we got her up for the day. I'm wiped. She only got about 7.5 hours of sleep.

For those of you that experienced an extinction burst, when did it happen in the training and what was it like? I really think last night was just a reaction to the fireworks, given that the timing of her hysterical crying coincided with the fireworks (and there were a lot around us and they went for nearly two hours). But I could be wrong.

Here's hoping tonight is better for all of us.

And here's to remembering that you can have a dream night and then a night like last night. Sleep training continues to be a rollercoaster for us.

When I moved back to my hometown at her 18m (we lived overseas from her birth onwards) mark we did CIO with intervals from 1-15 mins max and eventually she did lay down on her own and sleep while I sat beside her — took only about... 4 hours? Put her in at 7 and she slept at 11.

Since that day, we changed our minds and did our own thing according to our instincts and intuition. So it became a sit beside and pat her to sleep for about a month (10-15mins). Then it became sit beside and hold her hand for another month (10-20mins). And then it it was only sit beside her cot until she sleeps for maybe another month (10-30mins) and since a few months ago, it’s been “goodnight, go to sleep don’t make noise and stop kicking the cot. I love you! Bye bye” and she sleeps within 15 mins on her own. Sometimes after some talking and playing or tossing and turning but very good. 

I’m not sure if any of you need to hear this or if it’s an appropriate post for this sub but sometimes I think sleep training take time but it can be a comfortable process for the kid and parents. It was slow and steady but now other people can put her to bed and I can go out or I can immediately go do what I need/want after she’s in bed. It was a tiring phase and I wondered when it will end but I’m happy with the process and progress we made! 

Sometimes it depends on your kid and also your persistence. I guess ours was not that great haha I didn’t want to and wasn’t willing to push her into the deep end so suddenly.

He was also napping like a champion. 

&#x200B;

This past week he's been harder to put down, for naps AND at night, taking up to an hour at night sometimes to go down. Now he won't go down unless I nurse him side-lying.

Towards the end of this magic he stopped waking up at 3 and slept from 7-8 til 5am, nursed on one side for about 5-7 minutes and then went back down until around 7am.  He was also napping like a champion.

This past week he's been harder to put down, for naps AND at night, taking up to an hour at night sometimes to go down. Now he won't go down unless I nurse him side-lying.

I’m just happy we aren’t up every 2/3 hours like before. Anyways that’s another problem I have because Ferber says if she wakes up at 5/6am not to let them cry it out I guess. How do I get her to sleep until 7/8?

Anyway naps are a nightmare because they are never longer than 30-40min. I nurse her then she falls asleep and I put her in her crib and then she’ll pop up wide awake and cry until I go get her. How do I get her to sleep longer? If I pick her up and nurse her she’ll fall back asleep. 

So.. 
how should I get her to sleep longer at night if it’s even possible?

I’d love her to have 2/3 naps one can be short like 30-40min but the other one has to be longer because she’s so miserable and falls asleep nursing when she eats every 2/3hours.

How do you stop the association with nursing and sleep?

We did it!,sleeptrain,18,c99t5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/c99t5r/we_did_it/,9,1562316256.0,"I began sleep training my son 2 weeks ago. He was 4.5 months when we started, now 5 months. The reason I decided to sleep train, was that he would only fall asleep in my arms after long amounts of nursing, patting and rocking. He would be sound asleep, and the moment his butt touched the crib, his eyes would pop open and then the tears would start. We would start all over again, and I was not getting much sleep of my own. 
We now begin our bedtime routine at 8pm which includes - nursing, bath, pjs, book and bed. 
I check on him if he is actually crying/screaming after a couple minutes. But if he is whimpering, mumbling, I do not go in. I have been watching the monitor while he falls asleep so I can see if he has an actual problem, without entering the room. 
I think it has been hugely successful and I am so thankful to all the stories and advice I read on here before we began. Here are our results: 

2 weeks of sleep training times:

Friday - 45 mins 

Saturday - 35 mins 

Sunday - 11 mins 

Monday - 23 mins 

Tuesday - 15 mins (daddy’s turn) 

Wednesday - 10 mins (no crying!!)

Thursday - 7 minutes 

Friday - 15 mins (no crying)

Monday - 8 mins

Tuesday - 8 mins (woke after 2 hours, down less than 1 min after nursing with  no crying)

Wednesday - 8 mins (no crying)

Thursday- 10 mins (only 1 min crying)

Observations:

-set bed time makes evenings easier/predictable 

-set wake up time makes planning around naps easier 

-Sleeping through the night, only 2 nights of the past 2 weeks he’s woken up around 2:30 am to nurse, and immediately gone back to sleep

-dad is now able to put him to bed and do his whole bedtime routine without any hassle, allowing me to go to my weekly baseball without worrying that he’s screaming for 2 hours 

-even at our longest time of 45 mins, that’s still shorter than the amount of time it used to take me to nurse/rock/pat him to sleep 

-baby learned to roll over this week (back to stomach). Now when he is crying, he usually rolls onto his side and calms down and quietly plays, or falls asleep right away. 

-I’m not entirely sure if it’s related, but he has been falling asleep for naps better. He still naps in my arms most of the time, but he doesn’t fight it anymore. Just nurses a bit and then he’s out cold.

He is about ~~4.5~~ 5 months old (like a few days away) but only 4 months old gestational since he was 5 weeks preemie (apparently since he was born at 35w and ""38 week is considered term"" he's closer to 4.25 months gestational. He acts developmentally speaking like a ""pretty advanced"" 4 month old baby. So he's acting closer to 5 months really.

Essentially the past week has been a crapshoot. Sometimes he will go down easy at 6:30 but otherwise he screams HARD usually for about 5 to 10 minutes but I've seen up to 20. Doing a check in just pisses him off so we switched to full extinction.

Once he is asleep hes fine and only wakes up maybe twice for food. By 6:30 he is usually very very tired which I think is part of the problem. So he's sometimes sleeping for 6-7 hour stretches (he takes 6oz now) without waking at night. (Which i feel further shows he is ""ready"" for this as we've seen him do it fine before when we started.

He typically naps at 7:30 when he wakes up for the morning. Then around 11. Both of those naps last around an hour. However his last nap or two are always like 30 minutes and he wakes up feeling crabby. Other problem is he never naps without crying hard for the last 2 naps. Soothing wont help and only keeps him up longer....so we have to sorta let him cry it out sometimes (which usually lasts maybe 5-10 minutes). The problem with the last nap is it's close to 4:30 when he wakes up pissed after a short nap....but it's so close to bedtime it's hard to know what to do.

Are we doing something wrong? Seems like he shouldnt still be crying like this. There is nothing seemingly medically wrong and when  we first started ferber it went super smooth for the first couple of weeks....

edit: FWIW I know he is capable of self soothing because the first couple of weeks were great, and sometimes now he'll go down without much fuss (like last night he whined for 5 minutes but otherwise went to sleep just fine). Also if he's super upset we'll rock him to calm him down till he gets sleepy (not eyes closed though) but he seems to just get mad randomly sometimes and scream his head off.

I almost wonder if retrying comforting is a good idea, but it just seems to piss him off more. I mean he's only ever cried over 10m like once or twice on really really bad days (where he is WAY overtired).

**NIGHT 10**

Fell asleep in 9 mins. Woo. She still cries *hard* when Dad says goodnight and leaves. But she calms down afterwards now (she didn't use to). She snuggles tough when I sing her the lullaby, but then cries hard again when I lay her in her crib. Slept until about 4:30a. I left it for about half and hour, because she was on/off crying, but after this long I suspected poop. I was right. Changed her diaper and put her back in the crib a little after 5a and it took her until 5:45a to fall asleep again (with bouts of hysterical crying). Slept another 45mins until 6:30a. Total night time sleep was approximately 10 hours.

**NIGHT 11**

Today was our first **intentional** two nap day. We've had a couple of accidental two-nap days, which were not ideal. She fell asleep in 2 mins (YAY), ***but*** she woke up 20mins later and cried on/off for 20mins. She then slept until 4:45a. I didn't go in this time, because when I first noticed her awake at 4:45a, she was just sitting there. Then when her crying did start, it was on/off and she would keep lying back down. She fell asleep at 5:30a until 6:20a. When I went in to get her though, she *did* have a poop, so I felt bad I didn't check :/ Total night sleep was about 10 hours and 13 mins.

So both nights are showing greatly improved time to fall asleep, with signs that she is self-soothing even during the bedtime routine, which makes me so happy. Not to mention long stretches of sleep without wake-ups or crying. But the mornings are the issue. She seems to wake up around 4:30a - 4:45a almost every day, and lately, with poop! I think it is the poop that wakes her up and makes it hard for her to go back asleep, especially at this hour. And it is hard for me, because after the Ferber checks weren't working, we went pretty much full extinction, but knowing that she has had a dirty diaper more often than not, makes me think I should check sooner. I don't know what to do! Should I check sooner, given her history of pooping at this hour? I am hoping the pooping is temporary, because she never pooped overnight when she bedshared with me. Is it possible it is stress poop or something?","UPDATE 11 & 12: Ferber/CIO Nights 10 & 11...falling asleep and long stretches of sleep, but mornings are still hard to figure outI forgot to do an update yesterday, so I am just going to put them both together in one post for anyone interested in following along in a our sleep training journey.

"Feeling defeated with nighttime sleep training, just starting nap training and feeling like a POS mom.",sleeptrain,10,c8fhyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/c8fhyz/feeling_defeated_with_nighttime_sleep_training/,16,1562132605.0,"So, I started sleep training my son right around his 4 month sleep regression. I think he was about 4.5 months and we were using the Merlin suit. It went super well to start, he took to it wonderfully, and slept longer stretches than he ever had while we were co-sleeping. 

He started rolling over maybe a week and a half after we started sleep training, so we transitioned him to the Love to Dream sleep suit with the arms undone and occasionally the Halo sleep suit, so he had total mobility. He’s been a belly sleeper ever since he’s been out of the Merlin suit, which seemed to begin frustrating him with the lack of range of motion.

That’s when we started noticing a steep decline in his self-soothing, once we transitioned him out of the Merlin. He went from falling asleep with minimal if any crying at all to scream crying for upwards of 20 minutes. Still to this day, he is just about 6 months, and still hasn’t re-learned to self-soothe since being in the Love to Dream or Halo suit. He still cries for an average of 15-20 minutes every night. We only go in to readjust him if he manages to wiggle himself into the corner of the crib. We don’t do check-ins as we found them to prolong his fussing and raise our anxiety.

WTF happened to his progress?? WTF are we supposed to do to fix this? He literally hasn’t self-soothed to sleep since he transitioned out of his Merlin suit. He just cries until he exhausts himself.

His sleep patterns are all fucked up, too. Some nights he will do a 5 or 6 hour stretch of sleep followed by a couple of 2 or 3 hour stretches until He is up for the day at  6:30 or 7am. Other nights he is up every 1.5 to 2 hours until he is up for the day at 5am. He has the exact same bedtime, exact same bedtime routine, which has become very brief because he generally loses it by bedtime. His bedtime is like 6:15pm now and I don’t want to move it any earlier or else it’ll just be really unsustainable. Husband would never see him, I’d imagine wake time would become earlier, and 6:15pm seems wildly early as it is. I’m really cognizant of his wake times during the day between naps to make sure he doesn’t get over-tired. They’re between an hour and a half ish- 2.5 hours depending on time of day.

Then that brings me to naps. While he is decent enough at night sleep, he just has never figured out solo day sleep. It’s a sore subject. He will only take cat naps in the morning, either in the stroller or the car seat, until his long nap, which he will only take cuddled with me, most of the time constantly nursing. He will sleep for like 2.5 hours around noon if I lay down with him. I’ve never been able to get him to nap on his own longer than 30 minutes, which is why we do the cat naps and the one long nap. This is the only way I’ve seen him well rested in a good mood, with this set up, which is why I’ve been terrified to try nap training.

Six months of stopping everything every single day to lay down with my babe in the middle of the day has taken a toll on me. We started nap training this morning and wtf are we doing. It’s only 3:30pm here and he’s utterly exhausted from scream crying for 30 minutes and only sleeping for 30 minutes at a time. He’s only managing to stay awake for an hour in between his shitty, short naps until he completely loses it and has a meltdown. I’m considering scrapping this whole thing and accepting my fate as the mom who napped with her kid until he went to college. I’m heartbroken. I’m frustrated. I’m jealous of every mom who’s been able to set their kid down anywhere to nap.

What are your experiences with this? I just want to know what we're potentially getting ourselves into. 

For reference she's sleeping 7am to 8pm with 3 to 4 night feedings now. She already puts herself down to sleep most nights and self soothes really well. I've tried to use the Taking Cara Babies method of 'SITBACK' to reduce night feedings already, but when she's hungry she'll just cry and cry ( we've waited it out and gave up at 40m).

Anyways normally we sorta sit there and listen to him cry until he's out, but honestly it's stressful and yesterday I said ""We need to just do SOMETHING, because sitting here doesn't really help anything but make us second guess ourselves"".

Is this bad to do? I mean we can clearly hear him but since he's been amping it up hardcore it's just so stressful to listen to. I've been walking outside and tending to the garden (I have the baby monitor hooked up to the phone FWIW). It just seems like it doesn't help to sit there and just listen to him crying for 30 mins every night?

I think I just feel guilty? Like he's crying and im basically torturing him or something but I know sleep is what he needs and me keeping him up and coddling him will just make things worse and him more dependent. I think I just need to remember ""He isn't crying because he's in pain, he's just letting me know his displeasure"". I guess it's just one of those things where I know he needs something more than he does (and it's not like he cries like this everynight, just especially the past few nights).","Is it bad to ""occupy yourself"" while your kid cries?So the past few days our 4.5 month old has really ""amped"" up the crying at night.

Anyways normally we sorta sit there and listen to him cry until he's out, but honestly it's stressful and yesterday I said ""We need to just do SOMETHING, because sitting here doesn't really help anything but make us second guess ourselves"".

Is this bad to do? I mean we can clearly hear him but since he's been amping it up hardcore it's just so stressful to listen to. I've been walking outside and tending to the garden (I have the baby monitor hooked up to the phone FWIW). It just seems like it doesn't help to sit there and just listen to him crying for 30 mins every night?

&#x200B;

I think I just feel guilty? Like he's crying and im basically torturing him or something but I know sleep is what he needs and me keeping him up and coddling him will just make things worse and him more dependent. I think I just need to remember ""He isn't crying because he's in pain, he's just letting me know his displeasure"". I guess it's just one of those things where I know he needs something more than he does (and it's not like he cries like this everynight, just especially the past few nights)."

Most of the books on sleep training seem more geared towards younger babies who can't stand up/don't have object permanence yet.  

Right now, our bedtime routine for our 19 month old is brush teeth, diaper/pajamas change and put in sleep sack. Then he gets a paci and he has a sippy cup of milk while we read.  We put on white noise and hold him while singing a song, then put him in the crib.  He usually falls asleep on his own, although sometimes he wants a hand rubbing his back.

However, he wakes up around 11ish and he won't go back to sleep unless he comes into our bed and one of us lays with him.  He usually gets a small bottle around this time (we've been slowly cutting down on the milk).  There have been a few times when I've given him his bottle in the crib and he goes back to sleep, but he usually wakes around 3 am on those nights.  

I'd love to get him spending the whole night in his own bed.  We don't mind a little crying, but the times we've given him time to settle himself, he just gets more and more worked up.

It's making us question if we are doing the right thing because this is intense screaming. Also used to we could do controlled comforting but that makes it worse now so we have to do full extinction.

Any ideas? I mean he is clearly capable of sleep training but the past few days have just been awful (we've tried to keep ourselves busy during these screaming sessions)

edit: FWIW I don't think this is reflux, he takes reflux medicine and really hasn't had problems before. it's really been sorta the past week he's slowly hated being put in bed more and more.

He used to take about 2 two-hour naps a day. Now it's rare for him to sleep more than an hour, so he often ends up needing to go down 3 times. Most of the time that third nap he desperately needs doesn't even happen.

He's just so exhausted during the times he *is* awake (ie crabby and fussy) that it's making our days together so stressful. 

Any advice???

I know genuine sleep training shouldn't happen till she's a few months old, but that there can also be some things we can do today to aid/promote longer sleep, e.g. swaddling, white noise, dream feeding etc. However I'm reading some conflicting things about these things, especially when it comes to feeding.

Would love folks' take on these topics!

1) Daytime feeding:

Theory A - feed more during the day, even waking to feed every 2-3 hours and always offering (though not forcing) both sides, so baby loads up on calories and needs less at night. Also definitely add a ""dream feed"" right before bed time.

Theory B - stretch out the time between feeds (eg 15min at a time) so baby gets used to larger meals with longer intervals in between.

Theory C - just feed on demand. Offer both sides when breastfeeding, but don't need to deliberately wake her to feed or stretch out time between feeds.

2) Nighttime feeding:

Generally when baby wakes at night, give her a few minutes to see if she self soothes. If she keeps going, then..

Theory A - every time baby awakens in hunger, do our best to offer a full feed if she'll take it -- eg diapering to wake her up between sides -- to promote longer sleep after. If baby looks super exhausted after just one side / ""mid-feed"", then just listen to her cues and let her sleep instead of forcing even more feeding.

Theory B - when baby wakes to eat, ok to offer more of the ""minimum"" amount or snack that helps hold her over, especially when we've already been feeding well during the day. For e.g., just offer one side, and if she falls asleep, don't wake her up - just let her sleep more. This way we go back to sleep more quickly, and she gets used to less food at night. However this does risk baby actually still being hungry and waking soon after again to feed.

For e.g., just offer one side, and if she falls asleep, don't wake her up - just let her sleep more. This way we go back to sleep more quickly, and she gets used to less food at night. However this does risk baby actually still being hungry and waking soon after again to feed.

Advice appreciated!!"
How to handle night wakings when they're close to a feeding time?,sleeptrain,2,c7iyv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/c7iyv2/how_to_handle_night_wakings_when_theyre_close_to/,3,1561954385.0,"Hi, sorry if this has been asked before, but I couldn't find exactly what I was looking for. We recently started sleep training my LO (6mo). We did full extinction and so far, she's done great. Last night (night 5), she went to sleep within 10 minutes, no crying. 

The problem is, I can't quite figure out night wakings. I know she can sleep until 5 AM without eating -- she's done it multiple times, before we even decided to sleep train. So, we decided that was the 'cut off' time. Anytime she woke before then, we'd let her cry. Two out of the past 5 nights, she woke up around 12/12:30. Both times, it took her about 45 mins of crying to get back to sleep. Then, she'd wake up at 5/5:30 and I'd feed her and she'd go right back to sleep, waking for the day around 7. 

Then, last night, her first/only wakeup was at 4:15. At that point, what do you do? It's before the ""cutoff"" time, so my first thought was that we shouldn't feed her. But she ended up crying until 5 am anyway...so do you feed her at that point? Or does that reinforce the idea that if she cries for long enough, she'll get fed? 

Or, would it be better to just eliminate night feeds altogether? Her doctor says she doesn't *need* to eat during the night, so do I just cut those feeds cold turkey? 

Appreciate any insight.","How to handle night wakings when they're close to a feeding time?Hi, sorry if this has been asked before, but I couldn't find exactly what I was looking for.

She fell asleep in ***ONE MINUTE***. I think I am still in shock. When I saw her lay down on the monitor, I thought for sure she would spring back up in a couple mins to cry, but NO.... she stayed asleep! Well, she cried a little when I turned on the water in the bathroom, but she settled quickly.

Then she slept until what is becoming her first stir time--4:40a. So, she essentially slept from about 7:10p - 4:40a! AND, at 4:40a, she didn't have a big cry, she soothed herself within a few mins and fell back asleep until 5:45a. When she woke up at 5:45a, she wasn't even crying. She was sitting up and hanging out calmly. Then she even laid back down with her eyes open. Right on 6a she started crying though (right as we were about to get her). She had a poop, so I think that's why she was crying.

What a fantastic night. I *never* thought she could fall asleep that quickly on her own, let alone sleep all of that time happily. I am so proud of her and so happy that we have stuck it out. It is really paying off and I couldn't be more grateful for all of us.

Pulling to stand tips,sleeptrain,1,c7b3yj,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/c7b3yj/pulling_to_stand_tips/,7,1561914274.0,"Hi everyone, I'm looking for some advice on how to handle a baby (9.5 months) who relentlessly pulls to stand in his crib at bedtime. Has anyone got any tips?

Some background for context below, but essentially that's the question above.


Our baby has GORD, which meant that early on, sleep training wasn't an option. We even briefly hired a sleep consultant who told us that essentially until the reflux subsided there wasn't a lot we could do (except for all the standard things like raising the head of his crib, etc). Things improved a great deal around 7/8 months, and I was able to do some training by putting him down awake, and letting him roll/crawl around until he fell asleep, or sometimes gently holding him in place until he calmed down. This coincided with a massive reduction in night wakings, down to one or two a night! We also started scattering dummies/pacifiers around his crib after he fell asleep so that he could find one in the night if he needed it.

However, after a series of teething and illness, we are back to holding/rocking him to sleep, and the night wakings have increased, the naps have gone off, and even putting him down at the start of the night has become harder.

The problem is that if I put him down, he immediately goes to the side of his crib, pulls up and grins at me. If I put him down again, he does it again. If I leave him he eventually gets overtired and cries. I can't hold him down gently anymore because he struggles and gets worked up. As soon as I release him, he rolls over, goes to the side of the crib, and pulls up.

Has anyone else experienced this as a stage? How did you beat it? My wife and I both hate rocking the baby to sleep at this age (he's heavy and grizzly), and he hates it too! We all need more sleep!","Pulling to stand tipsHi everyone, I'm looking for some advice on how to handle a baby (9.5 months) who relentlessly pulls to stand in his crib at bedtime.

It took her 40 - 50 mins of crying before she finally fell asleep last night. I think there were a couple factors that played a role in the time-to-sleep bumping back up (although I realize there might also be no explanation I could point to). Her top teeth look like they are starting to break through. I had to go in a couple of times to replace the binky string (I know this is controversial, but we are comfortable with it). I think the checks riled her up a lot.

She then kept having periods of intense crying on and off for a couple of hours. I hated every second of it. I wanted to go in there and scoop her up, although I know I never would have. 

She finally seemed to settle for the night between 9:30p-10p. I don't think she then really stirred until 4:50a. It is possible I didn't hear her, but to my knowledge she slept a solid slog through this time period. Fantastic progress! When she was up at 4:50a, I though *oh no*. But I left her and she fell back asleep, or maybe just laid down and relaxed until 5:45a. Yay. We then waited until 6a to get her. During this period she had some intense cry moments, but she also babbled, sat down, and even laid down for a little while. We are trying to go in and pick her up when she isn't in a hysterical period, because we don't want to reward the crying.

So the night had more positives than negatives, but it was still hard for getting her to sleep. Sometimes I wonder if she will ever not be hysterical when we go to put her down. Have other people still been struggling 6 nights in? I feel like so many stories talk about the first few nights and then it is smooth sailing. I am not trying to be a downer, and I can definitely see the progress, I guess I just wonder when we will ever have a night where she settles in under 15 and sleeps through. I suppose I should just be patient and grateful for the progress and remember how far we've come in a week from where we were when we were bedsharing. Also, we are finally installing her black out curtains today. I’m hoping this makes a big difference!

It took her 40 - 50 mins of crying before she finally fell asleep last night. I think there were a couple factors that played a role in the time-to-sleep bumping back up (although I realize there might also be no explanation I could point to). Her top teeth look like they are starting to break through. I had to go in a couple of times to replace the binky string (I know this is controversial, but we are comfortable with it). I think the checks riled her up a lot.

She then kept having periods of intense crying on and off for a couple of hours. I hated every second of it. I wanted to go in there and scoop her up, although I know I never would have. 

She finally seemed to settle for the night between 9:30p-10p. I don't think she then really stirred until 4:50a. It is possible I didn't hear her, but to my knowledge she slept a solid slog through this time period. Fantastic progress! When she was up at 4:50a, I though *oh no*. But I left her and she fell back asleep, or maybe just laid down and relaxed until 5:45a. Yay. We then waited until 6a to get her. During this period she had some intense cry moments, but she also babbled, sat down, and even laid down for a little while. We are trying to go in and pick her up when she isn't in a hysterical period, because we don't want to reward the crying.

So the night had more positives than negatives, but it was still hard for getting her to sleep. Sometimes I wonder if she will ever not be hysterical when we go to put her down. Have other people still been struggling 6 nights in? I feel like so many stories talk about the first few nights and then it is smooth sailing. I am not trying to be a downer, and I can definitely see the progress, I guess I just wonder when we will ever have a night where she settles in under 15 and sleeps through. I suppose I should just be patient and grateful for the progress and remember how far we've come in a week from where we were when we were bedsharing. Also, we are finally installing her black out curtains today. I’m hoping this makes a big difference!

Question about six month old,sleeptrain,5,c6cm82,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/c6cm82/question_about_six_month_old/,5,1561706611.0,"We sleep trained LO about a month ago and she will put herself to sleep. But only after crying a lot. Not for longer than twenty minutes or so but every time we lay her down she gets so upset! It’s been a month of this and I’m wondering if there’s something wrong? Shouldn’t she be used to the routine by now? Looking for advice.

Edit: It is more than just fussing. My older one fussed for a bit before sleep but this sounds different to me. She does wake up happy each morning and when she wakes for her 2am feed. I just feel so bad that she is still crying it out after over a month. I want her to be content in her crib before she sleeps.","Question about six month oldWe sleep trained LO about a month ago and she will put herself to sleep. But only after crying a lot.

He has a strong nurse to sleep association and required my help to fall back asleep every time he woke.

Things are going very pear shaped and it's breaking my heart.  I have been following the full extinction guidelines in precious little sleep.  The desired wake time is 6am, and I'm happy to still nurse once or twice a night (no earlier than around 11/12pm).

Night 1: Put him to bed at 6pm, **cried an hour**, asleep at 7.  Woke at 8:30, **cried 30 mins**. Slept 2 hrs til 11, nursed, fell asleep easily.  Slept 2 hrs, fed at 3am, then **cried 1.5 hrs**.  Slept 1.5hrs til 5, then fussed an hour.  He fell asleep right on 6am and I didn't have the heart to wake him. Woke at 7.

Night 2:. Bed at 6, **cried 30 mins**, asleep at 6:30.  Slept 4.5hrs.  feed at 11pm, asleep by 11:30.
Slept for 1 hr, then **cried for 1.5hrs**.  Asleep at 2:30 for 3.5hrs.  woke at 5:45, let him chatter til 6 then got him up.

Night 4:. Bed at 5:30; **cried to sleep** by 6.  SLEPT 8HR and 45MINS til 2:45.  Fed.  (No idea what happened here, maybe catching up on sleep debt??  That day was comprised of several short naps 30-40 mins duration.)  Slept 3:15 til 6.

Night 5: bed at 5:30, **cried to sleep** by 6. Woke 45 mins later.  **Cried less than ten mins**, slept from 7 til 10.  **Cried 20 mins**, slept 10 til 3, feed.  Slept 3 til 6.

Night 6:. Bed at 5:15, **cried to sleep** by 5:30.  Slept 3.5 hrs til 9, **cried 30 mins**.  Slept 9:30 til 1, feed.  Slept 1:30 til 4:30.  Feed. ** Cried 5 til 6**.  Feel asleep right on 6 for 45 mins.  Got him up.

Night 7: bed 5:45, **cried to sleep** by 6:15.  Slept 1.5 hrs, **cried 20mins**.  Slept 8:30 til 12, feed.  Slept 12:30 til 4, feed.  **Cried from 4:15 til 5:15;** slept 1 hr, up at 6:15.

Night 8 (writing this at 4am):. Worried that the early (pre-6pm) bedtime was causing the 4am crying, I tried to allow a late catnap/later bedtime.  
Catnap went well, bub woke happy at 5:45 after 20 mins sleep, but got fussy incredibly fast.  Only managed to keep him up about 45 mins before his fussiness got out of hand and I put him to bed at 6:45.
Bed at 6:45, **cried to sleep** till 7:15.  Slept 40 mins, **cried 10 mins**.  Slept 10 mins, **cried 20 mins.**  Slept 2 hrs, **cried 45 mins**.  Slept 1 hr, feed at 12:30am.  Slept 1am til 3am.  **Cried 10 mins**.  Slept 10 mins.  **Cried 30 mins.**  Now 4am and I'm writing this post and hrs just fallen asleep.  

What has gone so horribly wrong????  I can handle the crying at bedtime if it means he sleeps well at night, but things have gone from moderately better, to terrible, and it's breaking my heart listening to him cry several times a night.  

Comments and observations:

-  I guess the late bedtime was a flop - but I didn't expect it to be such a disaster

- everything I read says baby's last wake window of the day should be longer than normal, but I have noticed this doesn't seem to fit my bub.  He seems to burnout more quickly at bedtime, no matter how hard I work to make naps happen in the day.

- he only naps on me after nursing or rocking, some days he will have several short naps (30-45 mins), others he will have 2-3 long naps of 1-2hrs +.  

- some things I read sat to cap his naps at 2 hrs (he is very cranky when woken), others say never to wake sleeping baby as day naps will encourage night sleep.  

- today (day 8), he had a 3.5 hr nap from midday til 3.30, and started getting fussy at 5pm (hence the extra catnap after that).

- early in the week I don't think I was separating nursing from bedtime enough but since about night 3 or 4 I have separated it a lot.  

- on earlier nights I worried hunger was waking him, but when he feeds later in the night he doesn't seem ravenous, and weissbluth reckons wakeups aren't to do with hunger.

- temp in his room is about 67f/19c.  He is wearing a singlet, long sleeved onesie, sleeveless fleece sleep bag.  He has a waffle Jersey blanket folded in half.  

- Dark Room on his own, cot, white noise.  

-  I only read today that weissbluth doesn't seem to bother with separating nursing from bedtime??

Last night was definitely the best night so far. She fell asleep in 22mins. She didn't have any major meltdowns, although she did wake a couple of times and cried between 5-20mins (we didn't do checks).

She woke up at 5am though... eep. This girl has always been an early bird, but I am trying to see if I can stretch her until 6am. So I left her for awhile. She cried a bit. Then babbled. But then she did a much worse cry and I didn't feel right leaving her. I picked her up at 5:30a. Turns out, she had a poopy diaper. I based her first nap time off of the time I picked her up, not the time she first woke up.

Is there anything else I can try for the early waking? I had a dream that after sleep training, she would sleep until 6-7a ha. I understand I am supposed to leave her until our ""ideal"" wake time. But what if she is hysterical? There is no way she is going back to sleep at 5:30a. Her bedtime is 7p - 7:30p and where it falls in there is usually dependent on when she wakes from her last nap. She has historically only gotten 10hours of sleep overnight on her good nights, but she definitely isn't getting a full ten during sleep training.","UPDATE 6: Ferber/CIO Night 6 (really night 5)...best night so far, but early wakings are brutalIf you want to see previous posts, just click on my name and you can see them all there.

We have a really hard time at bedtime, Nugget goes down for the night and then wakes up every 10-20 minutes for the first 3-4 hours of the night and needs to be held and bounced back to sleep. I have to hold him in a specific position, stand, and bounce with a certain rhythm. Then he will sleep for a 5-6 hour stretch, wake up and party for an hour, get rocked back to sleep, and sleep another 2-3 hour stretch. At this point I know the holding and rocking is a sleep crutch, and I was planning to start CIO a la takingcarababies tonight. But here is the problem:

We have had 0 healthy days since March. Right now he is at his best, with a rattly cough, mild wheezing, and eczema that covers his entire trunk, neck, and both arms and legs. His last official diagnosis was croup 3.5 weeks ago, but we have also had all the things, all the time. Most notably, he has also had 2 separate instances of what seems to me to be vomiting allergic reactions. Both times were the only times he has had eggs, and he ended up vomiting approximately every 10 minutes for 4-6 hours, and then was fine afterwards. Went to the allergist today really hoping they would find some food or environmental allergies and then we would know, okay we can avoid these things and you will be healthy. Except all the skin testing came back negative, the allergist completely dismissed my concerns that the eczema could be allergy related, and she seemed to not even want to consider the idea that he could have FPIES because it is so rare and his reactions were so delayed (12 hours and then 4 hours after eating). We are doing some blood tests but I don’t think we will find anything. The allergist wants us to start reintroducing the foods we have been avoiding and we will just see if it happens again? We would follow a slower introduction schedule but the problem with vomiting reactions are that if you are having a minor one it would just be nausea or stomach cramps or whatever and we absolutely wouldn’t know if those were happening except that he is sad/crying/etc.

Also, after the initial bedtime struggle he often wakes up from his long stretch coughing, and can’t stop. Also if we leave him to cry at bedtime it frequently turns to coughing. When he is really sick we will take him into the bathroom and steam him until he stops coughing. Now when he is just mildly sick I often hold him upright or will feed him. He can go all night without feedings but I feel like if I woke up coughing in the middle of the night I would want a drink.

So, should I start trying sleep training? Am I going to be able to leave him to cry not knowing if he is having some minor reaction to something that makes his stomach upset? What about when he starts coughing? Will picking him up when he seems sick undo all the work we do? And to further complicate matters, I know Cara recommends you be home for 30 days when you go through this process, and at the very minimum do the 14 at home. We are traveling 1 week from today for 4 days (at my parents, where I am okay with some crying but don’t want to set him back too far with an unfamiliar environment), and then once we get back will be traveling 10 days after that for 5 days (to my grandparents where she will probably not be okay with as much crying, and the environment will be totally new and a one hour time difference), then after that we have a long weekend trip 18 days later with friends. And we might sneak another long weekend trip in before or right after that too with a different set of friends. The next time we will have 30 days in a row at home will probably be in September. Can I keep surviving the crying until then? Part of me thinks I should just start and deal with whatever happens as it happens, he might do well and be over it in 3 days, and part of me is terrified I am going to have a whole summer with hours long scream fests at bedtime.","Crosspost from my Monthly Bumpers: Nugget is 8 months old, bounced to sleep, bedtime is rough.I need sleep help:

We have a really hard time at bedtime, Nugget goes down for the night and then wakes up every 10-20 minutes for the first 3-4 hours of the night and needs to be held and bounced back to sleep. I have to hold him in a specific position, stand, and bounce with a certain rhythm. Then he will sleep for a 5-6 hour stretch, wake up and party for an hour, get rocked back to sleep, and sleep another 2-3 hour stretch. At this point I know the holding and rocking is a sleep crutch, and I was planning to start CIO a la takingcarababies tonight. But here is the problem:

We have had 0 healthy days since March. Right now he is at his best, with a rattly cough, mild wheezing, and eczema that covers his entire trunk, neck, and both arms and legs. His last official diagnosis was croup 3.5 weeks ago, but we have also had all the things, all the time. Most notably, he has also had 2 separate instances of what seems to me to be vomiting allergic reactions. Both times were the only times he has had eggs, and he ended up vomiting approximately every 10 minutes for 4-6 hours, and then was fine afterwards. Went to the allergist today really hoping they would find some food or environmental allergies and then we would know, okay we can avoid these things and you will be healthy.

Update 2: 10:40 literally as I finished writing update 1 he woke up. He cried for 30 .... seconds!! and put himself back to sleep. That’s really really encouraging. He’s never really gone back to sleep after crying without intervention. Hopefully this is progress already.

Update 3: 12:05 woke up and I fed 5 oz bottle. I’m watching him on video monitor attempt to self soothe right now after the feeding. He’s not actively crying, just working it out. This is the first night without the swaddle, and without the paci... so it’s just a lot different.

Last night was a bit harder for me, but that is, I'm sure, in part because she skipped her last nap so bedtime was thrown off. She had been awake nearly 5 hours by the time she went to bed, which is *not* her usual. Her routine meltdown was intense, as were her first cries when we laid her in the crib. She was crying so hard. She fell asleep within 15 mins (improvement on previous nights), but she stirred frequently over a period of time.

I went in at about 35-45mins (I think) to settle her and it seemed to calm her while I was there, until I left the room. So I am not sure if it helped or hurt (or maybe both).

She slept until 5:20a. So she got about 9.5 hours or so. Ideally, we'd prefer a 6a wake-up, but I couldn't imagine her falling back asleep at that hour.... Should we let it go to our ideal wake time?

Correcting an Overtired Baby using Ferber?,sleeptrain,3,c5iu43,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/c5iu43/correcting_an_overtired_baby_using_ferber/,6,1561540616.0,"Hi there,

Stay at home dad of a 12.5 month old son, K. 

Long story (sorta) short, K has been a pretty decent sleeper. STTN at 9 weeks with no method needed. Typical 4 month sleep regression and resumed STTN. Around 10 months we hit another regression that caused him to begin waking up 2–3 times a night and requiring long periods of rocking, songs, etc. 

So my wife and I decided to utilize the Ferber method. And it went as well as it could have gone I think. Night 1 he cried for an hour and then put himself to sleep and STTN for 9 hours. And then it improved dramatically from there so that within a few days there was little to no fussing for both naps and bed time. 

That all went well until we went to Italy for two weeks... and everything (for a variety of a factors that I won’t go into detail here) fell completely apart. He slept for naps and night for the first three days despite the six hour time change and then for the next ten days only slept 1-3 hrs at a stretch. We were all miserable. We barely got by by taking shifts and cosleeping which we had never done before, and none of us slept that well that way either. Realized he was cutting one maybe two teeth and also might have an ear infection. 

We are back home now and K is incredibly overtired. He’s a happy active baby during his wake times but naps and bedtime are still a mess. Everything we’ve read says go back to your routine after vacation and it will all fall into place, but he seems to be at such a sleep deficit. He got at most 9 hours of sleep in a 24 hour period for the last 11 nights when ordinarily it was 12-13. 

What’s more important here? Re-establishing routine and re-Ferberizing starting over with 3 or 5 minute checking? Total extinction? Just getting him to sleep well by any means necessary? 

My guy instinct says K needs to be well rested and not teething and cleared of an ear infection, if any before trying to sleep train again, but in order to get him well rested at this point we’re probably going to establish some sleep associations that will have to be undone. 

Any help? Our trip was a complete disaster, seems incredibly selfish in hindsight, and we’re all exhausted. 

Thanks in advance for any feedback.","Correcting an Overtired Baby using Ferber?Hi there,

My son is sick for the first time since sleep training - how do I handle this?,sleeptrain,10,c5b7nn,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/c5b7nn/my_son_is_sick_for_the_first_time_since_sleep/,14,1561509397.0,"A week ago I was so excited because my 4 year old and 15 month old both slept through the night in the room they share. Awesome!

But now my son is sick, and I'm waffling about how to proceed.

We did Ferber.

He isn't nap trained. At all - we lay down and snuggle together. When his sister was in school, he and I would nap together. Now that she's home, I lay down with him and leave after he falls asleep, but watching him on the baby monitor. This hasn't been an issue - he had been going straight to bed at night and sleeping all night. 

But he's sick. So two days ago, he woke up maybe 30 minutes into his nap that's usually 1.5-2 hours. I rode it out and let him cry until he fell back asleep, maybe 20 minutes. That night, he cried a for a full 10 minutes before he went down, then woke up and cried for five more minutes and then went back to sleep.

Yesterday my, ""oh, but he's sick!"" outweighed my, ""He has to sleep on his own!"" He slept maybe 15 minutes at nap time and then cried for 30...and I screwed up and picked him up. Then last night he cried for another 30 minutes before going back down, but he kept coughing himself awake and I eventually (midnight or 1) went and brought him in our bed. It was awful. He thrashed around for a couple of hours but eventually fell asleep.

Right now he's asleep on me in the living room so I can watch my daughter and he can definitely sleep.

Here's the thing: he's honestly sick. His nose is so stuffy that it's uncomfortable for him to lie flat. He's got a nasty, juicy cough. No fever, but his sister had one and they have the same thing.

So what do I do? I'm afraid that letting him cry for 30 minutes and then picking him up gave him the impression that if he cries long enough, I'll come running. I'm fine for him to be in our bed right now, but is that going to absolutely ruin our sleep training? We're going on vacation next week so I was already expecting some retraining later. Is that just the deal?

Nothing with the routine or timing has changed.  He’s pretty easy with naps, will chirp for a bit but falls asleep (4ish hours of naps a day). Naps are 75% in the crib in his room; all night sleep is in his room). Bedtime is 6-6:30 depending on the timing of the last nap. 

When we first sleep trained he would wake up once at 3 or 4am and I would go feed him.  So I started setting an alarm for 2:30 or 3 and would just go wake him up and feed him - I was thinking that maybe him crying and my going to him in the middle of the nights would reinforce the crying. 

In the last week or two he has started waking up at midnight and I go feed him and then he will wake up again around 5, we treat it like nighttime, feed him and put him back down.  He will sleep until 8-8:30.  Around this same time he has started crying at night before falling asleep, which sucks after weeks of him chirping until sleep.  

I’m going back to work next week and would love if we were able to get back to one wake up a night.  Or if two times a night is just going to be our normal for a while, I would love some reassurance that we are doing it right.  Should I be waking him up for feedings rather than responding to his cries?

Naps are 75% in the crib in his room; all night sleep is in his room). Bedtime is 6-6:30 depending on the timing of the last nap. 

When we first sleep trained he would wake up once at 3 or 4am and I would go feed him.  So I started setting an alarm for 2:30 or 3 and would just go wake him up and feed him - I was thinking that maybe him crying and my going to him in the middle of the nights would reinforce the crying. 

In the last week or two he has started waking up at midnight and I go feed him and then he will wake up again around 5, we treat it like nighttime, feed him and put him back down.  He will sleep until 8-8:30.  Around this same time he has started crying at night before falling asleep, which sucks after weeks of him chirping until sleep.  

I’m going back to work next week and would love if we were able to get back to one wake up a night.  Or if two times a night is just going to be our normal for a while, I would love some reassurance that we are doing it right.  Should I be waking him up for feedings rather than responding to his cries?

Any insight or advice?  Thanks so much!"

Why are naps so much more difficult to sleep train?,sleeptrain,3,c5agb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/c5agb9/why_are_naps_so_much_more_difficult_to_sleep_train/,6,1561506287.0,"Our 4.5 month old does awesome at night (we started ferber about 3 weeks ago) outside of some hiccup days he usually doesn't cry more than about 10-15 minutes when we put him down around 7pm.

However naps are a complete crapshoot. I mean he can't sleep in his swing (he's too easily distracted by the light/sounds in the bedroom) but he cries hardcore when we put him in the crib (and we've increased the naps in the crib over the past week) but he's been going in the crib for at least 1 nap for the past weeks.

I really don't know what else to try. He's definitely tired and we watch wake windows and for obvious signs of tiredness (eye rubbing/starting to get fussy and whiney) and try to put him down before he gets too tired...but basically everytime he cries.

Nighttime he usually cries a little bit, but not for as long. But it's been 3 weeks...shouldn't naps have improved?

The only thing im going to change up that I can think of it adding blackout curtains (because while the room is ""dark-ish"" during the day, some light still shines in through the rigged up blanket we have over the blinds in the bedroom window). We have white noise and everything else going like usual.

Usually he sleeps about 30-40 minutes and then wakes up and starts crying again. We usually leave him in there for an hour total regardless, but typically once he wakes up he aint going back to sleep. He's clearly still tired when he wakes up too.

FWIW he sleeps great at night. We put him down at 7pm and he's usually ""awake awake"" by about 7am, and usually will sleep for his first nap pretty good till about 9am.

Is it worth sleep training if baby can fall asleep independently and can self soothe?,sleeptrain,0,c5c74m,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/c5c74m/is_it_worth_sleep_training_if_baby_can_fall/,8,1561513285.0,"Hello everyone,

&#x200B;

I am a lurker of this sub and finally decided to post since LO is exactly 16 weeks old today. Since he was about 6 weeks old I have been obsessed with getting him to sleep through the night since uninterrupted sleep is very important to me.  


Some background on my son's sleep: 

My son ate every 2-3 hours round the clock until he was about 10 weeks old, and since then he has been slowly stretching out his night sleep. I have been practicing ""drowsy but awake"" since he was 6 weeks old and he does a good job of falling asleep independently. I give him his last bottle (he is EFF) around 7-7:30 and put him in his snoo with eyes wide open (on weaning mode, so it is not rocking him), kiss him good night, and leave the room around 7:30-8; he usually falls asleep without any issue within 10 minutes but occasionally if he is overtired he will need some gentle SNOO rocking. We will then dream feed between 9:30-10 and depending on how much he is willing to eat then, he will sleep anywhere from 3-5 hours (his personal record is 5 hours and 40 minutes), eat about 3-4oz, then fall back asleep. That puts his night feed between 12:30-3. If it's closer to 3 he will sleep through until 6:30-7 and take a full feed (5-6oz) , but if it's closer to 12:30 he will wake up and snack (2-3oz) between 4:30-5.

As for naps, he takes 4-5 a day of varying length usually between 30 min - 1.5 hours. I don't plan on doing anything with naps at this time as long as he is getting adequate day sleep.

&#x200B;

As far as I can tell, his sleep habits are not terrible and are developmentally appropriate. Since he sleeps at least a 3 hour chunk minimum even on the worst nights, I know he can connect his sleep cycles.  I do let him fuss for a couple minutes when he cries and occasionally when he has trouble self soothing, the snoo can help him get there, and during times when he can't, I do soothe him with a shush/pat and/or paci. I don't feed him unless it's been about 4 hours since a full feed (or 3 hours since a partial feed), and I never offer a full feed between 10-6 in the hopes that he will night wean himself.

&#x200B;

I guess I am posting here because I can't help but feel a bit envious of the babies my son's age that are regularly hitting 6-8 hours without a feed, and am wondering if there is anything else I could be doing to help this process along. I've done a lot of research on various sleep training methods and all of them are about eliminating bad sleep associations and falling asleep independently, which he is already doing. 

&#x200B;

I am not opposed to CIO, even complete extinction, because I do want to encourage good sleep for him since I know we will both be happier that way. I just don't know if formal sleep training is something that could help him leap forward in his sleep journey or if I simply have to wait it out until he's older. I of course don't want to force him into anything that he is not developmentally ready for just for my benefit, either.

I thought I would ask here before hiring an expensive sleep consultant. Any and all advice would be appreciated!","Is it worth sleep training if baby can fall asleep independently and can self soothe?Hello everyone,

The nursing to bed is quite time consuming too, when mom lays down to nurse him to sleep, I might not see her for 30 to 45 minutes. And the awkward position cosleeping contorts her body into has given her a lot of back and shoulder pain.

So right now his schedule is Wake up 6:30-7:00AM. First nap \~9:30 (cuddle to soothe to bed) Second nap \~2:00PM (cuddle to soothe to bed). Bathe and sleep routine at 7:00PM. In Bed by 7:30 nurse to sleep. From then usually 30 minutes to bed, and wakes 2 to 3 times until mom gets into bed and cosleeps.

&#x200B;

Beginning with the July 4th holiday, I intend to use the extinction method as recommended by the book Healthy Sleep Habits. So I'll do the usual bedtime routine, then put him in the crib and just monitor him from a different bedroom. Possibly will take up to 45 minutes the first night, but may be longer. Mom will be in a hotel.

&#x200B;

Questions:

Do you think the extinction method is appropriate considering his age (13 months) and history (nursing to sleep/cosleeping)

Since naps require cuddling to sleep, should that be approached the same week? Or is it better to tackle one thing at a time? 

What should I look out for during the night? I'm worried he might get very sick from crying. Or what if he gets a dirty diaper from crying. When is it appropriate to go in and check?

So for naps he usually cries hardcore now for about 10-15 but then naps 40 or so. We've been leaving him in the crib a little longer and he occasionally will put himself back to sleep....but not usually for long

However the real problem is here lately when we put him to sleep it's a friggin nightmare. He screams like crazy and even doing checking makes it worse (whereas before it calmed him down).

Is this some sort of extinction burst due to him napping in there more? He just seems super cranky here lately. He is sleeping fine once he is asleep but man....

He did have one day where he got stuck staying up for wayyyy too long. But that was like 5 days ago.

Any ideas? FWIW he has increased his food amount by 4 to 6 oz....but were making sure hes eating. Maybe this is just some leap of some sort.

It is really more like her 2nd night, because night 1 was us caving in under 15 mins (see [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/c3awer/update_1_ferber_night_1_fail_we_caved_and_i_need/)). Her 1st real night was horrendous (see [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/c3piac/update_2_ferbercio_night_2baby_barely_slept_4/)). I always found these posts useful, so I hope this is helpful to someone. It also helps me process it all.

She started to cry as soon as she knew she was getting put in her crib. We decided not to check on her until 40mins and this was mostly to make sure she hadn't pooped (she stress pooped twice last night). We then did two more checks after 30mins each and only because her feet were between the crib bars (she keeps sitting up). We did a fourth and final check after another 13mins, again due to her legs through the bars, and she finally fell asleep after 1hr and 50mins. I realize we can't always help her with this, but this is a massive change for her, and we feel ok getting her legs unstuck. We don't go in when she is just sitting up and nodding off.

Woke up 25mins later and cried on/off for another 30mins or so.

Then from about 10:30p-4a she was *mostly* asleep. Although she would cry on/off, we didn't check on her, and she managed to soothe. I'm so proud of her.

At around 4a, my husband went in because she was crying pretty hard and we wanted to make sure she didn't have a poop. He did a diaper change and put her back down (no poop though). She settled in about 15-20mins and slept until 6:10a.

It was still rough, but compared to last night, such a definite improvement. I'm so happy for her that she figured more of it out and that my husband and I had the strength to stay out and let her do so. We didn't feel comfortable not checking at all, but I think we did a good job of waiting and reading her cues and cries.

While I know tonight will be hard too, I'm not full of the super dread I had yesterday.

We still haven't tackled naps yet, as the first night was too brutal on all of us. We plan to probably start those in the next couple of days.","UPDATE 3: Ferber/CIO Night 3...

Always wakes at different times each morn, usually between 5-6. The other nights are either horrible or not great (a lot of wake ups). I can’t find any correlations with why or how, so FIRST QUESTION: is this normal?! 

My other questions are about nap training, which I’m dreading a million times more than the night training, and wish I didn’t have to but not only do I not get a single moment to myself all day to get anything done, but I’m about to start a part-time job and I can’t go on like this (I haven’t slept for more than 2 hours or showered regularly since she was born). I currently have to hold her for most of her naps bc she wakes and cries when laid down. If she doesn’t wake when laid down she’ll only sleep for 20-30 mins in her crib, but will nap forever when held. 

So my nap questions:
•Should I be waiting to nap train until nights are better/more consistent? 
•What sort of wake windows are appropriate for a 9 month old? 
•How do I nap train?! Same as night? (We started our Ferber but checks made her more upset.)

She’s been sleep trained for a few months and after the training it fixed the early am wakings, until now.  Her normal schedule was a wake up between 6/7am and bedtime at 7pm.

We:
- Are careful with wake windows (3-4 hrs).
- Don’t let her oversleep during the day (2 naps total 3 hrs of sleep).
- Allow for 4 hrs wake window before bedtime and are flexible with our bedtime routine depending on the time of her last nap.
- Have her room resembling Dracula’s lair with white noise.
- Make sure she gets enough calories during the day.
- Do pop-in’s when she wakes up early or let her settle on her down until our desired wake up time (6am) (Pop-in’s aren’t working to get her back down, neither does not going in, both result in her babbling to herself without going back to sleep).
- Do our best to put her down for 9am when she wakes up early to still have her first nap be 3h after the “desired wake up time”, but if she wakes up too early we don’t let her get over tired and try to extend the window by 15 min every day (today we made it to 8:30am).

UPDATE 2: Ferber/CIO Night 2...baby barely slept 4 hours and cried on and off the whole night.

Because we were unsure it was right for our girl. We regrouped the next day and re-committed to beginning again last night.

&#x200B;

It was **HELL**. She barely slept 4 or 5 hours total and cried on and off the entire night. I feel like a monster. And I also don't know if it what happened is normal? 

&#x200B;

We started off doing checks at 3, 5, 7. It became clear checks weren't working well around 35mins, so we stopped. But at about an hour and 15mins/an hour and a half we went to check if something wasn't wrong. She had a poopy diaper, which must have been from stress, because she never poops at night. We changed it. She then kept falling asleep, sitting up and holding the crib bars. Eventually, she fell asleep face down on her tummy after an hour and 45mins.

&#x200B;

40mins later she woke up and was crying for nearly an hour before going back to sleep. I think we did a check or two here. Then, she woke every 45mins to an hour and a half.  We would do one check at 3mins, and then she would fall asleep within about 10mins after that. We didn't go in again, as her cries indicated she was trying to self-soothe. But then around 3-6am she was just up on and off the whole time crying....sometimes sitting up and bobbing in and out of sleep, sometimes hysterical, sometimes standing.

&#x200B;

It was INSANE. I think maybe our ""sometimes"" checking messed it up? Like I just gave her intermittent reinforcement. I know it is a massive change for her, because when she would stir in bed next to me at night and sit up, I would just cuddle her into me. So she has never learned fully how to ""lay herself back down"". And I know there is a wide range of normal... but is it within the realm of normal to have a first night like this? It seems extreme. I was planning to do naps at the same time, but there is no way my husband and I feel comfortable doing that today. So she will be napping on me today and we are planning to tackle them once she seems to cope with nights better. We are contemplating just doing full extinction tonight from the beginning. But when is it worth checking for a poopy diaper? Our video monitor arrives on Monday so I can't watch for her ""poop face""...

We tried it last night and we caved within 15mins. We did our bedtime routine as per normal. Then I laid her in the crib. She didn’t start crying for a couple of mins and then I did a check at 3mins. She was standing and hysterically crying when I came in. I sat/laid her back down and gave her pats and verbal reassurance and left. My husband did the 5min check and she was trembling, almost hyperventilating, and furiously swapping between two binkies and vigorously sucking. My husband came out and said he wasn’t sure this was right and explained she was trembling etc.

So we stopped. We comforted her and then I took her into bedshare. 

I feel so defeated. But I am also unsure if this is normal crying behavior in such a short period of time? She has been through A LOT of change the last couple of months with Dad being out for two weeks then a big interstate move where she had to be in the car for days, plus hotels, plus new home. So her separation anxiety has been amplified. She is also about to cut her top four teeth. Is that the reason her crying was so severe? Or is that just normal for Ferber? When I’ve read other stories, the crying hasn’t been described that way and I’m worried maybe the method is wrong for her temperament? Or are we just being softies?

Our 9 month old often (like 50%+) wakes up screaming an hour after going to sleep at bedtime (never at nap time). His freakouts are often under a few minutes, but sometimes last much longer (15-20 minutes). He is sleep trained and generally sleeps very well at bedtime and naps. No nighttime wake ups, few early mornings. 

There is no obvious rhyme or reason, though they seem to happen more frequently during leaps and if he hasn’t napped well during the day. Other than that, we can’t pinpoint any triggers. The only consistency is that they ALWAYS happen an hour after he falls asleep, so they seem to align with sleep transitions. 

This has been happening since he was three months old. Our sleep consultant thought it was odd but not concerning and thought it would end after sleep training. It hasn’t. We’ve mentioned it to his doctor who also thought it strange, but isn’t concerned. 

So...while we aren’t “concerned”, we would rather he not be distressed and would like to help stop it if we can.

My 4 month old has completed three nights of extinction, per pediatricians instructions. He’s 17 pounds and has not been eating throughout the night for 2 months. Pediatrician says he’s getting enough through the day.

Anyways, the past 3 nights have been rough, but not horrible. My question is I do not feel comfortable sleep training for naps yet. It’s too much crying and being overtired at night sets him up for failure. Since he is on day 3 of no swaddle for nighttime sleep, he is having a horrible time getting down for naps without it. He’s not rolling yet but is hitting every milestone so I think it’s close. Has anyone swaddled for naps and not for nighttime? Would that be too confusing? We also have the zippadee zip which is safe for sleeping for up to 2 years. Should I be using that in lieu of a swaddle?

So tired I can’t think of a title,sleeptrain,4,c2wys1,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/c2wys1/so_tired_i_cant_think_of_a_title/,4,1561071093.0,"The back story:
We have three kiddos, 11, 8, and 8mo.  The older two always slept with us.  The littlest did too until she stopped sleeping all together at 4mo.

We started sleep training at 5 mo with FIO SWAP (precious little sleep), it was going great, but hubby botched it by continuing to go in to give her the pacifier immediately when she started fussing.  

Sleep has gradually worsened until now, 8 mo, baby is in her crib in our room (don’t have another room for her), often sleeping for several good hours when she first goes down, but then waking frequently (1-3 hours) all night to nurse or be soothed (rocking and walking around until she falls asleep, only to wake up immediately or within 30 min of being put back down in the crib).

So I decided we were going to go full extinction CIO because we are so tired that we can’t remember what “the plan” is in the middle of the night for FIO.  Hubby took our two older kids out of the house for the night last Saturday and I did the deed.  

It went great!  Cried and fussed for 20 min at 8pm bedtime, then slept until 1:15, fussed for 5 min, then back out until 2, fussed more than 5 min so nursed back to sleep, slept until 7:30, then snooze button nursed and slept again until 8:30.  

2nd and 3rd nights were more of the same only with less crying and fussing (hallelujah!).  

4th night was pretty much the same, but she wouldn’t go back to sleep at 1:00 so I nursed her, still wouldn’t go back to sleep, thought she had pooped, changed her diaper (I was wrong), still wouldn’t calm, so nursed her again and she finally went back down, slept until 6:30.  Not too bad except for that 1 hr.

Then night 5, last night.  Only cried for a few minutes at bedtime.  Woke at 10, cried 10 min then back to sleep, woke at 10:25, cried 25 min then back to sleep, woke at 11:30, cried 5 min and I decided to go in and nurse her.  She fell asleep but woke up as soon as she hit the crib mattress.  Hubby and I were tired and ready for bed (remember we’re all in the same room).  I left her to cio while I put my pjs on.  Hubby freaked out about vocal cord nodules because she is now hoarse from all the crying so he aborted the cio and tried to sooth her back to sleep by rocking.  Didn’t work.

Fast forward 2.5 hrs and hubby has nixed the whole cio plan.  Baby was in bed with us (we slept with our older two who still have a hard time independently sleeping at 8 & 11) ping ponging back and forth until she finally nursed to sleep around 2am.  

Needless to say I didn’t sleep very well the rest of the night.  And now I have a fussy, clingy baby, and I’m a grumpy, sleep deprived mama.  

So here’s my dilemma, I don’t think full extinction CIO is going to work for us because we have to all be in the same room.  Sharing a bed is not working for me this time, I just hurt too much and don’t sleep that well.  Waking up every 1-3 hours to nurse and sooth all night long is crazy town, and leaves me and hubby and baby all grumpy and sleep deprived.

Does anybody have any thoughts on something else that might work for us??","So tired I can’t think of a titleThe back story:
We have three kiddos, 11, 8, and 8mo.  The older two always slept with us.  The littlest did too until she stopped sleeping all together at 4mo.

We started sleep training at 5 mo with FIO SWAP (precious little sleep), it was going great, but hubby botched it by continuing to go in to give her the pacifier immediately when she started fussing.  

Sleep has gradually worsened until now, 8 mo, baby is in her crib in our room (don’t have another room for her), often sleeping for several good hours when she first goes down, but then waking frequently (1-3 hours) all night to nurse or be soothed (rocking and walking around until she falls asleep, only to wake up immediately or within 30 min of being put back down in the crib).

So I decided we were going to go full extinction CIO because we are so tired that we can’t remember what “the plan” is in the middle of the night for FIO.  Hubby took our two older kids out of the house for the night last Saturday and I did the deed.  

It went great!  Cried and fussed for 20 min at 8pm bedtime, then slept until 1:15, fussed for 5 min, then back out until 2, fussed more than 5 min so nursed back to sleep, slept until 7:30, then snooze button nursed and slept again until 8:30.  

2nd and 3rd nights were more of the same only with less crying and fussing (hallelujah!).  

4th night was pretty much the same, but she wouldn’t go back to sleep at 1:00 so I nursed her, still wouldn’t go back to sleep, thought she had pooped, changed her diaper (I was wrong), still wouldn’t calm, so nursed her again and she finally went back down, slept until 6:30.

Baby wont nap in crib.

Up until now his normal nap routine is to go into his bouncer with a blanket and his stuffed monkey. It works wonders. He will sleep like this for 2 naps a day (8am-ish and noon-ish).

 For night time he normally falls asleep in his bouncer. We will wake him up to put him in a sleep sack and nurse him before putting him in a playpen in his room. If we do this he will happily roll over and go to bed. For what ever reason he wont sleep in the crib.

Daycare requires he sleep in either a playpen or a crib. I really dont know how to do this. I have tried before but he will start crying hysterically and then even if i put him in the bouncer he will refuse to sleep at least for another 1-2 hours. 

As i write this i am sitting in his room while he cries in his crib. He cried for an hour for his 8am nap before i gave up. This afternoon nap looks like its going to be the same..

I could really use some advice. I am worried about traumatizing him or making his bedtime impossible. Idk. I feel so defeated.

Edit: i dont mind if he sleeps in a playpen until we move him to a toddler bed. I just need him to get out of that bouncer for naps and into either into a  crib or playpen.

"Looking for Ferber advice/support for super attached, bedsharing, rocked to sleep, 8 month old girl",sleeptrain,10,c2hgl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/c2hgl9/looking_for_ferber_advicesupport_for_super/,34,1560981731.0,"We are planning to start Ferber with our very-attached-to-Mum 8 month old baby girl and I’m looking for advice and support (especially by anyone who has had success doing it with a super attached baby). Sorry for the long post, but I wanted to include as much info as I thought was relevant for anyone who is willing to give advice or support.

She currently bedshares with us after I rock her to sleep in my arms with her pacifier and butt pats. Note, she can crawl and stand, so this means I’ve been GOING TO BED with her, as we can’t leave her unattended on our bed. Her bedtime (which means MY bedtime) is 7-7:30p and she has a bedtime routine that she has had for months (bottle, *sometimes bath, brush teeth, diaper, massage while same lullaby playing, dad brushes hair, get dressed, books, sleep). She usually goes down in my arms within 5 mins with very little fuss. She wakes between 5-6a, although it’s almost always 5-5:30a. She has been sleeping through the night a lot of the time, but sometimes she wakes and is up for 30min-2hrs and just seems to want to be up. It takes forever for her to get back to sleep. Her nighttime sleep is 9.5-10hrs. I stopped giving her the bottle overnight when she woke up, after she was sleeping through, because I thought she didn’t need it. But the last couple of night wakings, I’ve given her some, because I worry she is hungry (she is still only 16lbs at 8mths—always been a tiny peanut).

ALL naps are in my arms... ALL of them. She has three a day, with the first two usually being 1hr 15mins and the last nap varying from 30m to an hour. So she gets about 3hr 15min of naps a day. Her wake time between naps varies but is usually 2hr 10min after first wake up, then 2.5-3hrs for others. These seem short, and I can push them sometimes, but a lot of times she seems to need to go to sleep. I can’t help but think she isn’t getting enough quality sleep at night.

There is a long story to explain all of these sleep associations, but this is already a long post, so I’ll skip that unless anyone wants to know. What I will say is that I never thought I’d be in this position.

I’m exhausted. I’m a PhD student and I’m getting almost nothing done. I have ZERO time to myself. I’m also pregnant with my second. We need to change her sleep patterns now.

Our plan is to try Ferber and keep the pacifier, as she can put it in herself. Our plan is to start with nights and then try naps, but I’m open to advice on whether we should just do all of it at once?

Questions:
1. How long do you stay in the room during checks? 30sec? One min?
2. Should we both go in at every check or should we alternate?
3. I’ve read that Ferber doesn’t work for every baby... is there a way to know it isn’t the “right” method for ours?
4. I know this will probably take 2-3 weeks to work, but when should we start seeing improvement?
5. If she wakes up and cries in the night, do we just start the clock right away and do the whole interval thing again?
6. After how many nights do you increase the intervals?

Thank you in advance for any advice or support.

We have yet to achieve drowsy but awake (though we are experimenting with FIO from Precious Little Sleep while we wait for her to be old enough to sleep train). For now she falls asleep in our arms as we bop on a yoga ball. She is up for the day between 6:00 and 7:00 am, and is fed during the night roughly at 11:30 pm, 3:00 am, and 5:00 am.

My mother and father have both asked me why I don't just go by the baby's schedule. I'm convinced if I did, she wouldn't nap more than once a day (before I learned about her wake span a few weeks ago, my tiny newborn was staying up for more than 3 hours at a time, yikes!) and would have to cry it out at night (which I don't think she's ready for yet). I guess I've been operating under the assumption that developmentally appropriate sleep/wake times are more important at this stage than independent sleep (which we will hopefully achieve around 4-6 months).

How to push my 5.5 month olds bedtime?,sleeptrain,1,c2au40,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/c2au40/how_to_push_my_55_month_olds_bedtime/,2,1560936954.0,"Hello all. 

My 5 1/2 month old daughter never needed sleep training (or I think she didn’t). 

She falls asleep on her own after our bedtime routine. Sometimes I have to go back in and put her pacifier in but she’s getting to the point where 90% of the time she does it herself. 

I know sleep training is sleeping without any crutches but I’m fine with the pacifier as she sleeps through the night with one to two feedings depending on teething or even how much she ate that day. We’re going through a phase right now where she eats lots one day and a bit less the next. 

My problem is with the time she goes to sleep. She used to sleep 7:00PM-8:30AM and that was great. But after Ramadan where we were out late most weekends due to breaking of the fast, her schedules been off. 
No matter when her last nap is, she gets cranky and starts showing sleep signs around 5:30PM (sometimes a bit later). 
Ideally I’d like her to sleep till 8:00AM. Even 7:00AM would be great. But lately she’s been up at 6:00AM every morning. Not going back down. 

Her bedtime now is 6:00PM. Or later depending on when she exhibits her sleep cues. 

I’ve tried a later nap but naps are an issue as well as she doesn’t have a consistent schedule due to my doctors appointments (I’m getting pre-cancer screenings and I’ve had many appointments in the last couple of weeks). 

Her last nap is usually around 3:00PM and lasts sometimes 45 minutes; sometimes over an hour. But she’s usually up around 4:00-4:15PM. 

I’ve tried making the last nap later so she’d wake up later but she still exhibits those cues and gets cranky around 5:30-6:00PM. 

I’d really love to be able to get up a bit later than 6:00 every morning.

""Even on the hardest days, I still prefer attachment parenting to sleep training. Babies are little for such a short period of time. I want to remember snuggles, not tears.""

This really resonates with me. I am the same. However I have had to sleep train for the sake of my marriage and my mental health.

I'm doing my best, and it breaks my heart that I've had to be tougher on my second than I was with my first, who I never let cry for even a couple of minutes.

My LO is coming up 9 months now and she's thriving, and finally sleeping from 7pm to 4/5am without calling for me. While training I didn't leave her if she was crying her really upset/distressed cry, she usually just cried her annoyed ""come feed me back to sleep"" cry.

But it still gave me nightmares, and still makes me feel uncomfortable, still makes me feel like an awful mother, even though my head acknowledges what I'm doing is the best overall pathway for our family. Without sleep training I can see a broken family in our future- the sheer exhaustion of 9 months of terrible sleep is breaking our marriage apart.

My little one actually seems happier during the day now, perhaps because she's getting better sleep. And she's just recently made huge leaps in her development. And it doesn't seem to have hindered her bond with me.

However I feel such guilt for sleep training her, for not going to her when she cried for me, when every fibre in my body wanted to run to her. I do think it has hindered my bond with her from my perspective- I have felt guilty.

Everyone I have spoken to of my parents generation said they left their babies to cry, that it was normal. I've spoken to two Drs and both said it wasn't hurting her, that she needs to learn to sleep through the night Etc etc etc.

Yet why does nature make it that the mother's instincts are to go to her baby as soon as she crys, why does it feel so wrong to leave her.

My husband is 100% into sleep training, and now that baby is sleeping better we are back on track marriage wise, and I'm back on track mental health wise, but gosh looking back over the past 5 months (I did the first step of sleep training when she was 4 months old- I taught her to go to sleep by herself) I feel uneasy and sad and guilty.

Does anyone else understand where I'm coming from?

On rare occasions, he wakes up at 5am and ready for the day, or sleeps in until 7:00am. He does two naps a day, usually 1.5hours long each. So that makes it roughly 12:30-13:30hrs a day in total. Isn't that too little for this age? 

Some fellow trainers have pointed to me that his night sleep is not enough. Even though it's not really convenient for our life style to change things, I am willing to move to earlier bedtime if it makes kiddo happier. Now here are a couple of contradicting observations that I don't know how to interpret.

1. If I put him down for naps after less than a 3.5 hour wake window, nap will almost certainly become 0.5 hour instead of 1.5 hours. Although he is really hard to keep up after 3 hours. But I rather him sleeping a little longer than missing a whole hour of nap, right? 


2. On a few occasions, I co-slept with him for his afternoon nap, and when he was up after 1 hour, I nursed him back to nap and he went for another hour or even more! So maybe he needs to sleep more? How can I encourage him to nap longer?


3. I haven't found any meaningful relationship between bedtime and wake time, but I think usually earlier bedtime caused earlier wake time. Like he won't really sleep longer than 9.5-10 hours at night. Admittedly, I haven't been consistent to an early/late bedtime for a week to be sure.

Ferber Expectations vs Reality,sleeptrain,13,c1mqh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/c1mqh9/ferber_expectations_vs_reality/,15,1560802022.0,"We are a little over 2 weeks into Ferber and some things have gotten better, but some things have not.  I guess I’m wondering how normal this is.

Background:  Kiddo is 4.5 months old.  Before Ferber, he would take 1+ hours to put down for bed (nursing and bouncing + lots of crying) then wake up 45 minutes later wanting to party.  He would self soothe himself back to sleep in the MOTTN, but that was incredibly rare.  He would wake up anywhere between 1-5 times per night and there did not seem to be much of a pattern to it.

The first night of Ferber he was asleep after 18 minutes of crying.  DH and I were giving each other high fives and feeling awesome.  He would wake up a few times at night before it was time to eat and could put himself back to sleep after about 20 minutes of crying.  I would feed him on a 5-3-3 type of schedule if he woke up.  I’m always concerned about weight gain so I did not want to eliminate feedings if they were needed, but I knew he did not need to be waking up 5 times a night.

Two weeks in and he still cries anywhere from 4 minutes to 20 minutes before finally falling asleep.  It is still that angry, omg why are you doing this to me cry.  One night there was only 1 minute of fussing but I think that is because I put him down almost asleep so he didn’t really have to do any work.

He still wakes up 1-2 times a night at times that are too soon to need to eat.  Sometimes he fusses a bit and puts himself to sleep.  Sometimes he cries loudly for 20 minutes.  There does not seem to be much of a pattern.

MY QUESTION: So is this normal 2 weeks in?  I always read the Ferber success stories and they are like “my baby didn’t cry by night 3!!!!”  But I also know those might be anomalies.  I’m ready for the crying to end so I fell less like I’m torturing him!

We are no longer doing checks because he doesn’t usually cry longer than 20 minutes.  Occasionally I’ve had to go in and pull him out from the corner of the crib because he gets stuck banging his head repeatedly.

6:00-6:30 wake up for the day
8:00- nap 1 (40 mins-90 mins)

My DH and I were agreed to sleep train our daughter by 4 months using CIO. Now, we have our doubts. We decided to postpone sleep train DD because she is going to put on helmet for flat head and, at the same time, she needs to go to daycare. Besides, DD is a very insecure and sensitive baby, we feel it is not the right time to sleep train her as well. So my question is how do you know what the right method is for your baby? More specifically, what points make you realize CIO doesn't work for you or no cry out method doesn't work for you?
To give you some background of my DD sleep situation.
 DD normally sleeps 12 hours from 8pm to 8am. We bottle feed her 3 times in between (4,3, and 3hrs). Our problem is DD sorta wake up a lot during night time. She screams or yells while her eyes closed (not in a fully awake mode). We have to comfort her by putting pacifier back, touch her, or tell her"" we are here"". However, if we don't do it fast enough, she will go screaming cry without opening her eyes. Even though we almost never need to pick her up to rock her back to sleep, we both still feel too tired to continue comforting her at night. (her bassinet is right next to our bed and we only need to reach out our hands to comfort her. ) We really want to reduce her ""wake time"" at the night, but not sure what to do is the right way.
As for why I feel DD is a sensitive and insecure baby. Here is an example, MIL came to help taking care of DD so DH and I could go watching endgame. When we got home, I saw DD sat in the swing and her eyes stared in the emptiness. MIL said DD barely slept and cried for an hour or more before she shut up... MIL couldn't comfort her and DD wouldn't go to sleep even though she tired herself out. Another example, DD develops yell/scream to get our attention. I suspect DD wants to get DH's attention while he plays video games so she yells/screams. 

I don't plan to stop rocking her at night time anytime soon, but I really want her to learn to fall back to sleep without stressing her out.","How do you choose the sleep train method for your baby?My DD is almost 5 months old. My DH and I were agreed to sleep train our daughter by 4 months using CIO. Now, we have our doubts. We decided to postpone sleep train DD because she is going to put on helmet for flat head and, at the same time, she needs to go to daycare. Besides, DD is a very insecure and sensitive baby, we feel it is not the right time to sleep train her as well. So my question is how do you know what the right method is for your baby? More specifically, what points make you realize CIO doesn't work for you or no cry out method doesn't work for you?

6:30am: start the day. If/when she’s up before that, we go get her at this time anyway.

Baby Fights Sleep Hard,sleeptrain,3,c124b1,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/c124b1/baby_fights_sleep_hard/,12,1560661519.0,"Disclaimer: I know my baby is way too young for sleep training, but I have been trying to lay a foundation for healthy sleep, and I’m running into some trouble when it comes to naps in the crib and bedtime in the bassinet. Maybe this is more of a rant? FTM having no clue what’s normal or not?

Baby is 6 weeks old. I try to follow EASY, but feed him on demand (he’s breastfed). This is typically every 2-3 hours, but if it’s been 3 hours between feeds, I do wake him from a nap. He’s been doing 6-7 hour stretches at night on his own since about 4 weeks old, and I’ve gotten the rare 8 hour stretch, so I feel bad even complaining, but actually getting him actually settled and down in his crib or bassinet is a BITCH. 

Between 2-4 weeks, the 5 Ss worked like a charm. Now, that soothing technique is completely useless. He just screams in the swaddle while being shushed and bounced for 30-60 minutes before he actually goes down. Once he sleeps, often he’s up in 5 minutes and I have to repeat the process over and over again. Sometimes it results in a good nap, and sometimes he’s up after 20 minutes and I just feed him and start over. 

Because this is not a fun process for anyone, I usually babywear for one or two naps/day, and he naps in the car seat while I run errands. He still cries before sleep most of the time even in the car or wrap. 

What can I do to soothe him? Is this just normal newborn behavior? He doesn’t cry much otherwise unless he’s woken up hungry or with a dirty diaper. He just really doesn’t seem to want to sleep, the little bugger. Maybe I’m being to hard on myself, but it’s frustrating to feel like I can’t calm my own baby.","Baby Fights Sleep HardDisclaimer: I know my baby is way too young for sleep training, but I have been trying to lay a foundation for healthy sleep, and I’m running into some trouble when it comes to naps in the crib and bedtime in the bassinet.

Baby is 6 weeks old. I try to follow EASY, but feed him on demand (he’s breastfed). This is typically every 2-3 hours, but if it’s been 3 hours between feeds, I do wake him from a nap. He’s been doing 6-7 hour stretches at night on his own since about 4 weeks old, and I’ve gotten the rare 8 hour stretch, so I feel bad even complaining, but actually getting him actually settled and down in his crib or bassinet is a BITCH. 

Between 2-4 weeks, the 5 Ss worked like a charm. Now, that soothing technique is completely useless. He just screams in the swaddle while being shushed and bounced for 30-60 minutes before he actually goes down. Once he sleeps, often he’s up in 5 minutes and I have to repeat the process over and over again. Sometimes it results in a good nap, and sometimes he’s up after 20 minutes and I just feed him and start over. 

Because this is not a fun process for anyone, I usually babywear for one or two naps/day, and he naps in the car seat while I run errands. He still cries before sleep most of the time even in the car or wrap. 

What can I do to soothe him? Is this just normal newborn behavior? He doesn’t cry much otherwise unless he’s woken up hungry or with a dirty diaper. He just really doesn’t seem to want to sleep, the little bugger. Maybe I’m being to hard on myself, but it’s frustrating to feel like I can’t calm my own baby."
Moving from bed sharing to crib?,sleeptrain,3,c11pz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/c11pz2/moving_from_bed_sharing_to_crib/,12,1560659175.0,"My son is 9 weeks old today and Mommy is hoping for some clarity on what intermediate steps I can take between moving from what we do now, which is “bed sharing and nursing to sleep for naps and nights” to little one “falling asleep independently in his crib”.

We saw the paediatrician yesterday and he told me I am spoiling my son by bed sharing and it’s going to be very hard to sleep train him. I’m under the impression that sleep training is hard and sucks - no matter if your moving away from “rocking to sleep” or “nursing to sleep”, and that the first three months are more about surviving than spoiling...

Bed sharing has helped us all get more sleep, as I can quickly soothe him when he wakes. However, he is starting to wake a lot more frequently through the night now than in past weeks, and it seems like he spends so much time attached to my nipple at night. He doesn’t sleep for more than a 2.5 hr stretch at a time, most often stirring after 50 mins, and will fully wake if I don’t offer him the breast promptly.

How do I know when he is able to “self soothe” so that he can fall asleep independently? Is it the ability to suck his hands/thumb/fingers that I am looking for? He has started sucking on his hands/wrists, but hasn’t gotten a thumb/fingers into his mouth for more than a second or two. He has just spat out every pacifier we have tried, so I don’t think that will be an option for him...

I’ve read PLS to prepare for sleep training after 4 mo and made a bunch of notes and have read a ton in this sub. But now I am doubting myself and wonder if I shouldn’t be at least trying to see if my son might be able to fall asleep on his own.

Should I be testing the waters to see if he might sleep in his crib instead of attached to my nipple?

Have you successfully trained your little one to sleep independently in their crib after bed sharing and free-feeding?

I have heard the first day is typically the worst. Last night she was up her usual every 2 hours. However, I usually cosleep. So she usually goes back to sleep relatively quickly. 

Last night we were doing timed checks. And sometimes I would be next to her crib and rub her head to calm her down. She was up every 2 hours and then it took her 1hr + to go back to sleep each time she woke up. I'm somehow even more exhausted than usual. I had close to no sleep. 

I'm REALLY not looking forward to tonight. 

Someone give me some encouragement 😫 

I'm also wondering how to cut out feeding every 2 hours at night? She absolutely would NOT go to sleep without a feed. And like I said it was an hour plus. So I was so exhausted I fed her. I was trying to nurse for a shorter period.","Ferber for 9 month oldI'm currently doing Ferber with my 9 month old.

At his one year appt I mentioned the waking up to his dr, but the dr said it's normal and if he knows how to fall asleep on his own then he'll stop waking up to nurse when hes ready. It's really not a huuuge deal that he does this, but I would like to move him to the other room sometime in the near future lol.

I have thought about maybe sleeping on the couch for a night so that I'm not there and potentially ""tempting"" him to cry for me. But lately his first wake up has been like 11 when I might not even be in bed yet, and he just screams and screams until I go up to get him.

We're trying to get into a groove before it's time for sleep training so baby is the only one who will need to adjust to it.

Our baby is 9 weeks, 5 days and has been turning into a great sleeper now that her reflux is clearing up. I'm following her ques for sleep training, she's not quite ready for it which isn't surprising because she's so young.

But I do want to start a bedtime routine. Moreso for my and my husband's sake. This way we're already in the groove of it when she's ready for sleep training and she'll be the only one in the house who needs to adjust.

Here's what I was hoping for, last bottle around 6:30, in the bath by 7, done with book and in bed by 7:30.

Here's the problem. My husband doesn't always get home at 6. Sometimes it's almost 7 by the time he gets home. I'm doing my best to have everything set up and ready to go by then but there's so much to get done (including our dinner) that I'm struggling. It'll be easier once she gets older and I can bathe her on my own and use bath time just before a nap.

Last night we discussed if it and my husband was wondering if there's any way to eliminate the bath every night. So I'm wondering if anyone has a bedtime routine that doesn't involve a bath. 

I know we could put her to bed at 8 but that means my husband would need to be the one to do it every night (worried about creating a sleep crutch) since evenings are the only chance I get to shower at the moment. Which means I won't be getting done with that until 8:30. Which will give me a half hour to eat and spend time with my husband before I need to get myself ready for bed. An 8pm bedtime just doesn't fit in for our lifestyle. Plus she's getting better at clonking out by 7:30

What am I dealing with here?,sleeptrain,3,c0e06w,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/c0e06w/what_am_i_dealing_with_here/,8,1560503484.0,"OK parents, I’m coming up on sleep training soon and need to know what I’m dealing with here. Apologies for length but details are important.

1. My kid was born FT but was super shrimpy at 4lbs 10oz, so our instructions were to fatten him up. In the first month he ate about an ounce every 45min or so. BF didn’t work out so we do those RTF bottles of formula that are 2oz each. 

2. Fast forward to now at 3 months, he’s topped 9lbs, and wears clothes fit for 6 months because he’s in the top 1% for length. Tall and skinny. 

3. Daytime Eating: He has no consistent eating amount or schedule. He eats at random times during the day, usually about 2oz in one sitting though will snack on more occasionally. It doesn’t help that my SAH husband feeds him whenever he cries but that’s a conversation for another day.

4. Bedtime: I do a bedtime routine (food, long bath, rocking, bottle to sleep in my arms, swaddle, into crib in his own room). Sound machine, blackout curtains and nightlight. Asleep usually by 7:30 or 8pm after eating about 4oz.

5. Night Sleep Part 1: This ends at around 11:30pm which gives him about 3-4 hours of sleep. Then he wakes and eats 4oz while I rock/swaddle him back to sleep. It takes about 20-30 min for this whole ritual. 

6. Night Sleep Part 2: This goes from about midnight until maybe 3am-ish. It’s my husband’s watch so I’m not there to see what happens at this moment so I’ll relay what my husband says. Basically he’ll eat either 2oz or 4oz and gets rocked/swaddled back to sleep. 

7. Here’s where it gets random and either of the following happens. The baby keeps this consistent sleep/wake pattern up until 7:30am when I come back and be all “good morning yaaay”.  Or the baby wakes up and is super AWAKE at like 4am and does the random nap/cranky-cry/eat pattern he does during the day (dubbed “asshole mode”). If husband can get him back to sleep during “asshole mode” the baby only sleeps for like 20 minutes and then gets cranky as hell. The baby does this until 9:30am when he crashes for 3 hours on his first nap.

From what I can guess, he needs more sleep during the day but that’s my only theory. How can I help my kid sleep more hours during the night stretch even if it’s broken up into 3-4 hour chunks? How can I possibly sleep train at 4 months when he still eats small amounts more often?","What am I dealing with here?OK parents, I’m coming up on sleep training soon and need to know what I’m dealing with here.

5. Night Sleep Part 1: This ends at around 11:30pm which gives him about 3-4 hours of sleep. Then he wakes and eats 4oz while I rock/swaddle him back to sleep. It takes about 20-30 min for this whole ritual. 

6. Night Sleep Part 2: This goes from about midnight until maybe 3am-ish. It’s my husband’s watch so I’m not there to see what happens at this moment so I’ll relay what my husband says. Basically he’ll eat either 2oz or 4oz and gets rocked/swaddled back to sleep. 

7. Here’s where it gets random and either of the following happens. The baby keeps this consistent sleep/wake pattern up until 7:30am when I come back and be all “good morning yaaay”.  Or the baby wakes up and is super AWAKE at like 4am and does the random nap/cranky-cry/eat pattern he does during the day (dubbed “asshole mode”). If husband can get him back to sleep during “asshole mode” the baby only sleeps for like 20 minutes and then gets cranky as hell. The baby does this until 9:30am when he crashes for 3 hours on his first nap.

From what I can guess, he needs more sleep during the day but that’s my only theory. How can I help my kid sleep more hours during the night stretch even if it’s broken up into 3-4 hour chunks? How can I possibly sleep train at 4 months when he still eats small amounts more often?"
Nap help,sleeptrain,5,c0btmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/c0btmz/nap_help/,11,1560490886.0,"I have no clue where to start with nap training my 5.5 month old.  Most people say to nap train the same way you night trained but we never had to...

Some background:
He never required any form of sleep training and never went through a regression. He sleep from 845pm-830am without waking every night. He’s been doing this for the past 2 months. Falls asleep on his own within 5 minutes of being laid down in his crib. Doesn’t cry or fuss himself to sleep. Just turns over and falls asleep. 

His first nap is very reliable. 10:20 I lay him down in his crib and by 10:35 at the latest he’s asleep. He usually sleeps until at least 11:30. 
His other two naps are awful. I’ve tried different wake times (2 hours, 2.5 hours, 3 hours) but nothing helps. I’ve left him to CIO for up to 30 minutes but he won’t fall asleep. I end up going in and rocking him for the remainder of his nap. I don’t really mind rocking him but I know I have to stop eventually.

For bedtime how hard was it to close the door and stay out for 12 hours?

We recently started sleep training my 4.5 month old. I'd like your advice on what his wake window should be before bedtime. 

**Background**: he usually takes five 45 minute naps. We are nap training at the same time as sleep training. The first 2 days he went down with just a bit of fussing for his first 4 naps but cried for his 5th nap so it got skipped. That meant he was awake for about 3 hours before bedtime. Those nights went to bed within 10 min or so with just some fussing. 

**Current situation:** The last two nights, he took 3-4 naps only (the 3 nap day he had one 3 hr long nap- beeeautiful), and was awake for about 2 hours before bed, and he cried for 45-1hr. 

**What should I try?** 

\- should I try a 3 hour wake window before bedtime? During the day I stick to 1hr30 min wake windows, but sometimes they go a bit longer if a surprise diaper comes up or something similar. I feel like 3 hours is way too long for him, but from the data I have it seems to suggest the 3 hour window is what he needs. 

\- My pediatrician recommends keeping babies his age up for no longer than 1 hr 30 min, so my other option is to try a shorter wake window.

\- other option is to stay with the 2 hour wake window and chalk his recent increased crying up to an extinction burst.

How did you decide intervals for MOTN feeds?,sleeptrain,16,bzdgls,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/bzdgls/how_did_you_decide_intervals_for_motn_feeds/,19,1560293529.0,"Getting ready to pull the trigger on full extinction tomorrow night with our 6 mo daughter. Our story seems to be a common one around here...ok going down by herself, but waking every 2 hours or so and needing to be nursed back to sleep, which results in me bringing her to bed with us because it's easier and I'm tired.

I think we've got everything ready...we plan to rip the band-aid off all at once and move her to the crib from our room at the same time we do CIO. I swear most of her night wakings are a result of her waking up and sensing we are in the room with her/smelling milk on me like a bloodhound, so we're moving her to her own space. 

We've already got a good bedtime routine and we're committed to CIO because checking on her just seems to amp up her crying, but what I'm really puzzled about is WHEN to feed at night? How did y'all settle on an acceptable length of time?

I know that developmentally, she probably doesn't really need to eat at night anymore, but I'd like to get her sleep patterns more established before I try to completely night wean.

Our story seems to be a common one around here...ok going down by herself, but waking every 2 hours or so and needing to be nursed back to sleep, which results in me bringing her to bed with us because it's easier and I'm tired.

I think we've got everything ready...we plan to rip the band-aid off all at once and move her to the crib from our room at the same time we do CIO. I swear most of her night wakings are a result of her waking up and sensing we are in the room with her/smelling milk on me like a bloodhound, so we're moving her to her own space. 

We've already got a good bedtime routine and we're committed to CIO because checking on her just seems to amp up her crying, but what I'm really puzzled about is WHEN to feed at night? How did y'all settle on an acceptable length of time?

I know that developmentally, she probably doesn't really need to eat at night anymore, but I'd like to get her sleep patterns more established before I try to completely night wean.

I have a 5.5 month old and I’m a teacher. Summer vacation starts on THURSDAY (!!! Yes!!!!) and LO is going to go to a parent led day and night schedule because we also have a 22 month old and I’d like to get both kids napping at the same time at least once during the day and I’d like to know when we can plan on getting out of the house each day. (Both essential keys to my sanity.) So I have broken it down into a few smaller goals, but I’m seeking input on the order in which I should go about them. Planning on using Ferber method, as we did this with kid 1. 

Here are my goals: 
-baby needs to sleep in her own room
-baby should be able to be set down drowsy for nighttime and naps 
-3 daily naps: 9 am, 12pm and 3 pm (7 am wake up and bed time) for about an hour each. 
-eliminate night time feeds (too early? What do you think?)

Toddler naps from 12:15-2:15 and is on the 7 am wake up and bed time plan. 

 So what do you think? Simultaneously? Night time, then daytime? I’d love to hear the feedback.","Help me figure out the order for my plans!Hi peeps!

She was waking up nearly every hour.  I was desperate.  I even ordered the 1200.00 SNOO one day out of pure exhaustion (after realizing how crazy spending that much money was,  I am returning it). I reached out to all my mom friends for advice and  I was recommended the Merlin Magic Sleep suit to try.  I was hesitant as  I have tried so many different things with my girl. She was currently using the love to dream swaddle (it worked alright for her).  Since early on we worked on my daughter learning to put herself to sleep. Never CIO, but would put down drowsy, pick up if needed etc. it  took us several tries at bedtime for her to finally fall asleep on her own. Sometimes up two hours a night.

Ideal 6 month old schedule?,sleeptrain,1,bymo2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/bymo2c/ideal_6_month_old_schedule/,1,1560130152.0,"Tl;dr: While I know each baby varies, what would you say is the ideal 6 month old sleep schedule? 

Our girl is a carptacular sleeper but we are working on this by slowly backing off how much we assist her to sleep at bedtime and she’s putting herself back to sleep overnight quite a bit now.   She is having some tummy issues that are waking her up - Doctors appointments this week to get the ball rolling in sorting out what it is because changing poopy diapers 8 times a day when you don’t have a newborn is no fun for anyone!  Naps are painful, currently still doing 4, two in crib and 2 in her carrier. On an average day her schedule looks something like this:

- Start the day: 6:30am
- 1st nap: 8am in crib (35-42 minutes)
- 2nd nap: 10:20am in crib (35-42 minutes)
- 3rd nap: 1pm in carrier (1-1.5 hours)
- 4h nap: 4pm in carrier (30 minutes)
- Bedtime between 6:30-7pm

She wake on average 2 times to eat (which I’m ok with) and usually 1 to.... 4 other times needing resettling, which can take 3 minutes or 3 hours (like last night.... send coffee and/or wine!). This gives us about 3 hours of daytime sleep and on average 10 hours of nighttime sleep due to the wakings.

Bedtime routine is bath, lotion, diaper, nurse, Merlin suit (which we want to wean off of soon too), say good night to things in her room, sound machine on, lights out, rock and sing for 2 minutes then in to crib where we see what she does and reassure her that she’s ok with our voice and occasional touch when she fusses and starts to cry.  If she gets hysterical or is approaching it, we’ll pick her up, calm her down, and put her back in to the crib.  The last 3 weeks she’s been falling asleep within 15 minutes on average.

I know she is old enough for CIO but my husband and I are not ready for that (yet) as we see that she can put herself back to sleep when she wakes overnight, so I’m just looking to make some schedule changes to see if that would help at all.  Or should we keep on trucking along as is until her tummy gets sorted out? (I’m thinking another allergy causing the green mucousy diarrhea - besides dairy and soy cuz I’ve already cut those out!).","Ideal 6 month old schedule?Tl;dr: While I know each baby varies, what would you say is the ideal 6 month old sleep schedule? 

Our girl is a carptacular sleeper but we are working on this by slowly backing off how much we assist her to sleep at bedtime and she’s putting herself back to sleep overnight quite a bit now.   She is having some tummy issues that are waking her up - Doctors appointments this week to get the ball rolling in sorting out what it is because changing poopy diapers 8 times a day when you don’t have a newborn is no fun for anyone!  Naps are painful, currently still doing 4, two in crib and 2 in her carrier. On an average day her schedule looks something like this:

- Start the day: 6:30am
- 1st nap: 8am in crib (35-42 minutes)
- 2nd nap: 10:20am in crib (35-42 minutes)
- 3rd nap: 1pm in carrier (1-1.5 hours)
- 4h nap: 4pm in carrier (30 minutes)
- Bedtime between 6:30-7pm

She wake on average 2 times to eat (which I’m ok with) and usually 1 to.... 4 other times needing resettling, which can take 3 minutes or 3 hours (like last night.... send coffee and/or wine!). This gives us about 3 hours of daytime sleep and on average 10 hours of nighttime sleep due to the wakings.

Bedtime routine is bath, lotion, diaper, nurse, Merlin suit (which we want to wean off of soon too), say good night to things in her room, sound machine on, lights out, rock and sing for 2 minutes then in to crib where we see what she does and reassure her that she’s ok with our voice and occasional touch when she fusses and starts to cry.  If she gets hysterical or is approaching it, we’ll pick her up, calm her down, and put her back in to the crib.  The last 3 weeks she’s been falling asleep within 15 minutes on average.

Sleep Coach?!,sleeptrain,6,byd6c5,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/byd6c5/sleep_coach/,12,1560060311.0,"Hey all,

Our 6 month old is feeding twice a night and waking up 3-5 times, but what has always been decent was the fact that her bedtimes were fast and she would fall back asleep within 5 minutes in the middle of the night. HOWEVER, now each awakening is taking 30 minutes or more and driving us off the wall, starting ever since we took a holistic sleep coach (wife's idea) to help us with getting her back on track. She advocates for listening to the baby's daytime cues to help her eat and sleep, to comfort her and to pick her up at night and calm her down when she gets riled, but we are not moving in the right direction and we need different help.

Can anyone recommend a sleep coach that will take our family and child and draft a day/sleep plan just for us? I've read alot of books but my wife has not been able to read the same since it's not in her native language and her hands are full 24/7. So if anyone knows of a sleep coach or service who will individualize a plan instead of regurgitating a book I already read, it would be greatly appreciated.","Sleep Coach?!Hey all,

He definitely has a long string of long naps at night with feedings in-between. I don't think his arm is waking him up because sometimes he stays wrapped up, so I think the hunger is waking him up.

9mo LO starting sleep train on doctor reco. Looking for advice and books to help get us started.

We found ourselves into a routine that’s been working very well so far. Dad comes home 6pm helps feed baby, watches baby while mom eats then around 7pm bathe baby, then 
Mom puts baby to bed and cosleeps with baby on a floor mattress in baby’s room, dad eats dinner and goes to bed in other bedroom to get sleep for work. LO breastfeeds before sleep and screams and cries for about an hour before falling asleep with mom, and wakes a couple times during the night crying and mom often feeds to help LO get back to sleep.

Our paediatrician strongly recommended today that mom stops feeding her in the night and we start sleep training her. Paediatrician said that breastfeeding in the night disrupts healthy sleep patterns and LO will develop an over reliance on mom and breastfeeding to sleep in the future. Doc also said that there is a higher risk of ADHD in a baby who had these types of disrupted sleep. Also mom will be going back to work in 3mo time and will need her own sleeping independence to get proper rest for work.

We’ve talked about sleep training when LO was around 6mo, but always felt like LO would have a difficult time of it, and were never sure how to start so we just kept doing what was working for us, thinking it would be fine.

Grandma will be coming to live with us for 6mo as a nanny and our plan was to have her switch out and sleep with LO in place of mommy in the babies room.

There seems to be a lot of conflicting studies and “best practices “ or “methods “
Regarding sleep training and the purpose of this thread is to try to get some advice and books to read that can teach how to best approach this tricky transition for our particular situation.

We were looking at the Ferber method of checking in on LO every 5min until she sleeps but Our LO can be quite finicky and fussy and has a deep attachment to mom. We talked about having me (dad) try to be the one to soothe LO when she wakes during the night since I won’t be associated with breastfeeding, but I’ve found that when LO is upset nothing other than mommy can console her. I’m not sure that she’ll get to sleep easily with me. Often she just screams louder when I try to soothe. I guess that’s part of the training? Also she’s not accustomed to her crib, she’s gotten used to sleeping in freedom on a mattress with mom. Not sure how she’ll adapt to being confined to her crib.

How should we approach this? Any good reading material you guys can suggest to get us started quickly? Preferably something written by a professional/doctor that’s popular?

Mom puts baby to bed and cosleeps with baby on a floor mattress in baby’s room, dad eats dinner and goes to bed in other bedroom to get sleep for work. LO breastfeeds before sleep and screams and cries for about an hour before falling asleep with mom, and wakes a couple times during the night crying and mom often feeds to help LO get back to sleep.

Our paediatrician strongly recommended today that mom stops feeding her in the night and we start sleep training her. Paediatrician said that breastfeeding in the night disrupts healthy sleep patterns and LO will develop an over reliance on mom and breastfeeding to sleep in the future. Doc also said that there is a higher risk of ADHD in a baby who had these types of disrupted sleep. Also mom will be going back to work in 3mo time and will need her own sleeping independence to get proper rest for work.

We’ve talked about sleep training when LO was around 6mo, but always felt like LO would have a difficult time of it, and were never sure how to start so we just kept doing what was working for us, thinking it would be fine.

Grandma will be coming to live with us for 6mo as a nanny and our plan was to have her switch out and sleep with LO in place of mommy in the babies room.

There seems to be a lot of conflicting studies and “best practices “ or “methods “
Regarding sleep training and the purpose of this thread is to try to get some advice and books to read that can teach how to best approach this tricky transition for our particular situation.

We were looking at the Ferber method of checking in on LO every 5min until she sleeps but Our LO can be quite finicky and fussy and has a deep attachment to mom. We talked about having me (dad) try to be the one to soothe LO when she wakes during the night since I won’t be associated with breastfeeding, but I’ve found that when LO is upset nothing other than mommy can console her. I’m not sure that she’ll get to sleep easily with me. Often she just screams louder when I try to soothe. I guess that’s part of the training? Also she’s not accustomed to her crib, she’s gotten used to sleeping in freedom on a mattress with mom. Not sure how she’ll adapt to being confined to her crib.

How should we approach this? Any good reading material you guys can suggest to get us started quickly? Preferably something written by a professional/doctor that’s popular?

Thanks!"

We are working on transitioning out of the swaddle, and she sleeps at night in her own crib in her own room. Goes to bed around 7:30/8, wakes once to eat around 4am, and then would typically sleep until 7 or so though this week she started at daycare and we have to be out of the house earlier so I'm having to wake her up to go :( poor babe. Currently her naps are hot garbage - but I'm attributing that to new surroundings at daycare and I'm not super worried about it yet.

&#x200B;

My question is - when putting a baby down ""drowsy but awake"" how ""awake"" do they mean? At bedtime we'll do our routine: bath, jammies, bottle, story/song in the rocker with her pacifier. By that point she's usually super sleepy if not asleep in my arms. Then I'll wrap her in her swaddle which will wake her up just a little. Then I lay her in her crib, put the pacifier back in, and pat her a few times on her belly. When she goes into the crib she's not typically deep asleep - but she's not super awake. Sometimes that's it and she's out for the night - sometimes she wakes up and cries a few times - we go in, replace the pacifier and pat her back to sleep (takes <3 mins) 

&#x200B;

Should I be trying to put her down more awake? I'm not trying to take away all soothing just yet - I know she's still too young, but I do want to set us up well for the future.","How awake is ""drowsy but awake""?I have a 12 week old - we are not trying to ""Sleep Train"" yet but rather want to instill healthy habits now to help us down the road.

Is there any way to stop the early morning wake ups?,sleeptrain,3,bxid4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/bxid4p/is_there_any_way_to_stop_the_early_morning_wake/,16,1559865446.0,"My 4.5 month old baby has been waking up at 5-5:30 am for weeks now. Does anyone have any advice to get him to sleep until 6:30 am? Ideally 7 but 6:30 is fine.

I’ve tried feeding him and putting him back down to sleep longer but he won’t go back to sleep. This is my go to method but I have also tried CIO with check ins for a few days now since he doesn’t appear to be that hungry when I feed him. This hasn’t been working either. Should I keep it up? I don’t want to get him up for the day at this time because I’m worried he wouldn’t be getting enough sleep. Is this incorrect?

I feed him every 3 hours starting at 6:30. I can’t do any more frequently because he’s just not hungry and spits up all the time. I try to stick to 90 minute wake windows. It’s hard because all his naps are so short (30-45 minutes). I try and give him 4 naps but the last one is a 20 minute catnap. It’s the only nap where he can’t fall asleep in his crib and so I rock him in my arms. If I don’t force a catnap out of him, he is super cranky by bedtime and won’t fall asleep well.

Bedtime is usually around 7:15-7:30. He is usually way too tired and cranky to go any later. 

Bedtime routine is put on a sleep sack and diaper, turn off the lights and use a night light, feed, read two stories, short massage, prayer and lullaby. He usually falls asleep on his own for bedtime. We use black out curtains and a white noise machine. 

I dreamfeed at 10:30 pm. I did sleep train him using The Happy Sleeper “Sleep Wave” method recently as he was waking up every hour. He responded well to this and never cried longer than 5 minutes. This was after getting the green light from his doctor.

Sorry if this is overly detailed...why is baby sleep so hard to figure out? Lol

Edit: I also meant to add I tried skipping the dreamfeed one night to see what would happen and he woke up at 11:00 pm crying so I’ll probably keep the dreamfeed up for a while.","Is there any way to stop the early morning wake ups?My 4.5 month old baby has been waking up at 5-5:30 am for weeks now.

Two weeks ago he was waking up every two hours to feed. We did CIO and only went in to feed if he cried after 3am because I felt (feel?) like he's too young to drop all night feedings even though he's 99th in height and weight. That got us to him crying at 4am for a feeding and 6:30am for a quick feeding where we would bring him in our bed to sleep until 7:45am. Not ideal but I was happy with it.

After a week long vacation, he's waking up at 2:30 wanting to nurse, then at 4, then 5 or 6 and at that point we bring him in our bed and he will sleep until almost 7:45am.

In the past I was hardcore against any form of sleep training because I felt that he would do it when he’s ready and I’d be okay with that. Newsflash, I need sleep and time to be myself and I feel like I’m drowning in baby. I’m a SAHM and with my kid literally 24/7 outside of the random hour or so that I get to myself when I have drs appointments every few months. He is so attached to me that I can’t leave his sight without him losing his shit and I can not handle it anymore. I can’t even shower without a meltdown. He’s also breastfed and is still feeding 3ish times a night. When he wakes up to nurse, I’m not able to go back to sleep for a while and it’s making me a monster.

The last 3 nights we’ve put him to sleep in his crib. Bedtime is dinner, bath, jammies, lights out/white noise, and rocked in his room then transferred to his crib. Then he usually wakes up 15 to 45 minutes later and cries. I’ve been having my spouse go in because he doesn’t expect nursing from him and I thought that would help. It’s not working because any time we try to put him back in his crib, he wakes up and screams. Literal screaming. 

 I cannot put him to sleep without nursing, it’s been a crutch that results in horrible crying for hours. He naps in his crib during the day and usually has no problems and ironically does better when my spouse is home, even if he’s not the one that puts him down. The last two days have been fucking awful. He won’t eat so then he just wants to nurse on and off and it’s throwing our schedule off. Today I put him down for his nap at 8:30 because he woke up at 5:45 (another issue that could be fixed by sleep training). He slept until 9 and then woke up and wouldn’t settle back down, and is just now back asleep at noon and our schedule is fucked. I spent from 9 until 12pm trying to get him back to sleep and I finally just left at 11:30 because I couldn’t handle his crying. I came back at 12 because he was still full on sobbing and making himself wretch. Now he’s asleep in my arms in his room and I’m a mess. He was pretty much nonstop crying for over an hour and just stood in his crib trying to climb out. He never once laid down without me doing it for him. 

Usual schedule is wake at 6:30, nap at 9 until 10, next nap is at 2:30-4, bed time is 7:30 and asleep by 8. This is compromised by him being anemic and one of his symptoms is being constantly tired. It’s something we’re working with his doctor and Hemotologist. I feel that his wake time would be later if he didn’t wake up when we did, my spouse works early and leaves by 7 so I try to see him before he leaves but that doesn’t really work when my son has been cosleeping. 

This post is a mess because I’m a mess and I apologize for format or rambling. I need help and I keep looking online for methods but I feel like everything I’ve found you have to pay money for or sign up and they send you one email a day for x amount of days. I feel need an example schedule that I can read and go by that isn’t 30 pages long because honestly I don’t have the brainpower for it right now. I’m so overwhelmed with all these methods and courses and I just need something simple that I can comprehend. 

I feel like an idiot for waiting so long to do this but I’ve loved our cosleep situation until recently. I realize that every age has its pros and cons but I couldn’t bring myself to sleep train until now and now I feel like I’m being punished and punishing my son for my mistake. I’m alone all day and I don’t have anyone to help me when I have days or weeks like this. My spouse tries to help and does what he can but he works full time and has been picking up my slack around the house because I just don’t have the energy to do my normal housework. My kid’s lack of sleep is sucking everything out of me and it’s forcing me to shut down.","Trying to night wean and crib train 1 year oldMy son just turned one and has been co-sleeping since he was 3 months old. In the past I was hardcore against any form of sleep training because I felt that he would do it when he’s ready and I’d be okay with that. Newsflash, I need sleep and time to be myself and I feel like I’m drowning in baby. I’m a SAHM and with my kid literally 24/7 outside of the random hour or so that I get to myself when I have drs appointments every few months. He is so attached to me that I can’t leave his sight without him losing his shit and I can not handle it anymore. I can’t even shower without a meltdown. He’s also breastfed and is still feeding 3ish times a night. When he wakes up to nurse, I’m not able to go back to sleep for a while and it’s making me a monster.

The last 3 nights we’ve put him to sleep in his crib. Bedtime is dinner, bath, jammies, lights out/white noise, and rocked in his room then transferred to his crib. Then he usually wakes up 15 to 45 minutes later and cries. I’ve been having my spouse go in because he doesn’t expect nursing from him and I thought that would help. It’s not working because any time we try to put him back in his crib, he wakes up and screams. Literal screaming. 

 I cannot put him to sleep without nursing, it’s been a crutch that results in horrible crying for hours. He naps in his crib during the day and usually has no problems and ironically does better when my spouse is home, even if he’s not the one that puts him down. The last two days have been fucking awful. He won’t eat so then he just wants to nurse on and off and it’s throwing our schedule off. Today I put him down for his nap at 8:30 because he woke up at 5:45 (another issue that could be fixed by sleep training). He slept until 9 and then woke up and wouldn’t settle back down, and is just now back asleep at noon and our schedule is fucked.

Help decode what our son is doing?,sleeptrain,1,bxc9mv,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/bxc9mv/help_decode_what_our_son_is_doing/,9,1559822961.0,"So about a week ago we decided that our 5 month old needed to start sleeping in own room in the crib. A few days before that we (successfully?) got him on 1 feeding at 9pm until morning 7:30am

So we’ve been trying to train him since his naps constantly required rocking him or getting him to fall asleep before putting him down. Otherwise he just wouldn’t calm down. 

We’ve also transitioned him in this last week to a sleep sack since he was fighting the swaddle and wanting to roll on his side. 

Naps are going good. Kiss him, give him a comfort thing and he’ll usually go down within 10-15 minutes usually. He’s a kicker and has to do his thing before he finally falls asleep. 

He naps at 8am and it’s sporadic. Sometimes 30mins sometimes 1.5hrs. Regardless his second nap is usually 2hrs later. Again, he’s been going down well now. 3rd nap is a stroller ride which he loves being pushed in. He’ll sleep the entire 1.5hr walk. So his last nap is 2pm - 3:15-3:30pm

We then play with him, give him a bath and feed. Usually by 4:45-5 we’ll finish up and try putting him down at 5-5:15pm. I’ve tried pushing it to 5:30 but it seems he gets over tired and cranky. Even though I know we should be pushing for closer to 7. 

Anyways here’s the problem, he will not go down easily like he does with his naps for the last 4 days. He will whine and cry for 15 and then it’s full nuclear melt down and crying like someone is cutting his arm off. Takes 5 minutes to calm him back down and have to put him on my lap and rock him for 30 mins until he dozes off and put him back to the crib. 

sorry for the super long winded post, but any ideas why it’s such a battle at this time ? He’s usually fine then at his 9pm feeding and usually goes back to sleep quickly. Sometimes he cries when he wakes at 9 until we feed him and change his diaper.

Is he not tried, getting anxious about going to sleep and fighting it ?

The first night he cried for about 45 minutes and gradually less with each passing day. Now it takes him usually 10 minutes (20 on bad days) and he's out. Even his naps are better with only a minute of crying before he passes out.

Baby just turned 3 months old

1) I can only get her to sleep while nursing 
2) her naps suck and after nursing will only sleep in swing
3) when to start sleep training and move into her own bedroom?

This May seem jumbled but my head has so many thoughts and I’m currently writing this as I lay on the couch nursing because baby woke up from a nap after 40 minutes and I’d clearly still tired -.-

I’ve seen in various articles that I should wait til 4 months, but I’m sure there is some stuff I could start now?

We usually head upstairs between 730-830, do a diaper change, play a little bit, get on jammies, swaddle and then nurse- the actual eating part doesn’t take very long but she stays on the boob. I can usually do up her swaddle and get her into her bassinet between 10/11, this always varies. She may stir a couple times in the night but doesn’t wake up until between 6-7. We nurse again then go downstairs for the day and she’s in her swing by 730 and asleep around 8 until anywhere between 10/11am. Then she eats, plays and I offer one more feed Incase still hungry then try to get her down for second nap between 12-1. This is also in the swing. Usually she gets drowsy at the breast or even falls asleep, wakes up for s minute or two then back to sleep. Sometimes this nap lasts 2-3 hours, or could be like today and yesterday where she wakes up, clearly still tired and I end up nursing ( because her eyes open as soon as I take my boob away) for the next hour to make sure she sleeps. Next she’s usually up around 330/4 and we either get a short nap out if her at some random point between then and bedtime, sometimes it’s the swing and some times on hubby. Then bedtime starts again.

She has taken a couple short naps in her nursery - thought I’d give it a try, but won’t settle once awake.

Wondering if anyone had any advice on how to get through this or if it could be the eight month sleep regression?

My LO had just turned 8 months, and dropped to 2 naps at 7.5 months.

Just lately his naps have been crap, not long enough and so we end up with an early bed time.

Today he went 5 hours between his last nap and bedtime, way too long! I tried and tried to get him to take a catnap bit he refused. He went down easily at bed time and was no more cranky than usual.

He typically wakes at 6am after 12hours unbroken sleep, however I'm returning to work next week and would love him to have a bed time of 7pm instead of 6pm so I can give him bathtime.

His day today (and how most days seem to be lately)

Wake 6am
Nap 8.45am - 9.45am
Awake 9.45am - 12.15
Nap 12.15 - 1pm
Awake 1pm - 6pm

As you can see his naps were only 1hour and then 45 minutes. This is a reoccurring problem, he is nap trained, falls asleep independently in his crib, pitch black room with white noise.

Am I missing something here?

My 4.5 month old is an OK sleeper once she’s asleep. We recently moved her to her own room and she’s doing pretty good. Waking up two to three times, for a diaper change or feed and sometimes will just fall back asleep while eating and I can swaddle her back up and bounce a little and then put her back in her pack n play (we’re waiting on a full crib until we’re sure she’ll stay in her own room). 

But for the initial sleep and naps it take FOREVER to get her down. We have a solid bedtime routine- start at 8pm, soft lighting, bath, pjs, nurse, swaddle, bounce on the ball while other parent reads- start to finish 30 minutes and we were both fine with it. 

Since moving her to her own room, it can take upwards of 30 minutes to get her to fall asleep. However this did reduce her night wakings. Around 6am, she wakes up to eat and she sleeps for another couple hours in bed with us (we are also fine with this)

I’m very hesitant to sleep train her, she doesn’t have a happy disposition to begin with and I’m worried she will not actually self soothe. And I don’t think I’d be comfortable until at least six months. As frustrating as it is, personally I’d rather spend all that time putting her to sleep than let her cry for long periods. 

So I guess in all of that, I’m looking for feedback of how to help her go to sleep better for naps and initial bedtime? Gentle sleep training methods?

If he wakes crying at 530 is there any point in continuing to train? Or do I just pick him up and start our day? Am I giving in to him both crying and getting picked up, plus allowing him to get up too early?

I would love anyone's thoughts!!"

I am currently putting off sleep training my 7mo. 
She is baby #2 and for some reason I am struggling with sleep training. With my son we sleep trained him at 6mo by letting him CIO, and it worked great. 
Here is the problem I am having this time. We live in a two bedroom apartment. So she is in a crib in our bedroom. She was super dependent on being swaddled since birth so the transition was really tough. 
Our current bedtime routine is: bed time at 7, she sleeps in the Halo sleep sack, nursed, placed in crib and then this is when it gets tough. I give her the soother and usually have to hold it in her mouth or she spits/pulls it out and cries. Most of the time she can’t settle and just flails her arms and grabs her face, so I end up holding her hands. I stand there until she is asleep. She usually wakes every 2 hours, sometimes 3. I have tried to just give her the soother and stand there until she is asleep, but she just wakes up again once i get into bed, so i end up nursing her back to sleep. She is super attached to me and i am the only one who can get her to sleep. I usually end up bringing her into the bed when she wakes at 3 and she will sleep until 7 no problem. 
There have been a few nights where I have just put her down and let her CIO, but for some reason I just cant bare it this time around.

Now it seems like it may be an issue with his silent reflux (already being treated with Max dose of zantac) because he fights me any time I try to feed him while awake. Even during the day he prefers to eat right before napping and I can't seem to separate feeding from sleeping right now. I always wake him up as I put him down for naps/bedtime and he always cries for a couple minutes before falling asleep so he is definitely still self soothing.

But the past few days he has been eating less during the day and eating a LOT during the 2-3 times he wakes up during the night. I'm so done with night feedings.

Bedtime routine is: diaper change, Merlin sleep suit, book, kiss goodnight. He sleeps in his own room in a crib with a white noise and a ceiling fan (he runs hot).  He is able to hang out in his crib and put himself to sleep without fuss. However, he has been waking up around 11:30 PM or midnight, again at 3:00 AM, and again at 5:00 AM (up for the day at 8:30/9:00 AM). All he wants when he wakes up is food. So much food. He eats 4-6 oz formula each feeding at night and goes instantly back to sleep.

&#x200B;

During the day, he is not a great eater, nor is he consistent. He averages between 25 oz-30 oz formula within a 24 hour period, half of that would be during the day and half at night. When we try to offer him a bottle during the day and he isn't hungry, he will push the bottle away with his hands or his tongue. You cannot force feed this baby and he picked up his eating habits from a bird. 

&#x200B;

During his naps, he will often wake up in the middle of the nap hungry, eat, then go back to sleep for another hour or so. He does not require a bottle to fall asleep for a nap initially.

&#x200B;

A month ago, at 4 months, our pediatrician recommended a version of CIO where we would feed him a bottle the first time he woke up (so anytime between midnight-3:00 AM) and wait 6 hours after that bottle to feed him again. We tried this for 8 nights. So wake up around 12:00 AM, feed him, back to sleep, but then he would cry non-stop upon waking up for the second time (maybe 4:00 AM or so) and would not stop crying until he was fed at 6:00 AM. We stopped this method after 8 nights because he was still crying for an hour, two hours every night for food and we were not seeing any improvement. The crying didn't seem to bother him and he is very good-natured and confident in general.

Another short crap nap a few hours later.   
Half the time we will get a three hour nap around 3pm.

My baby is 5.5 months old. He is a champion at bedtime, and we’ve worked hard on it. He does not nurse to sleep, and can fuss himself to sleep at his bedtime of 7pm-8pm 9 times out of 10 without assistance

Our problem (is it even a problem?) comes with MOTN wakings. On a good night he’ll sleep a 5-7 hour stretch, wake to feed, 3 hour stretch, wake to feed, then 2-3 hr stretch. 
On a bad night like last night he’s up every hour and a half.

Which technique would you use for MOTN wakings? How do I tell if he’s ready for night weanings?

So we did full extinction because we knew it would be fricking hard and we didn't want to make it worse which we felt check ins would..

Nice bedtime routine, fed her first instead, timings were all good so she was getting sleepy when we put her down at 7:30. Then the crying. I thought given all the factors we were in for at least an hour. Guys she cried for 10 minutes then she fell asleep. We were shooketh. Snuck a peek and she was asleep on her tummy.

Then at 10:30 She woke up crying, but it wasn't very convincing, not intense and kept stopping and starting and I wanted to not feed before 12. So that went on for 20 minutes then she fell asleep again.

She slept until 1:30 so I gave her a nice big feed she was still all sleepy put her back then we had a few mins crying (I think about 10) then she went back to sleep.

Guys she then slept until 7am.

I can't believe it.

I was so prepared for hours of crying, it was such a success but is it too good to be true? Was it a fluke? Could tonight be worse?

I really enjoyed sitting with my DH drinking a tiny amount of wine (I'm a lightweight and haven't drank in 18 months) and watching something, it felt so luxurious as normally I go to bed when she does and he sleeps elsewhere.

I bought ‘precious little sleep’ and I’ve been trying to remove my nipple before she lets go in the hope of breaking it slowly like the book says.

If I use SITBACK and it doesn’t work will it make CIO even harder? I’m terrified of caving in. I know my husband can’t bare it so I’m planning to do it when he’s away. Should I have a time limit? She’s breastfed so I can’t expect her to cry for 4+ hours and not offer her a ‘drink’? Should I start with a drowsy put down? That will definitely involve a feed.

Feeding while ST!,sleeptrain,8,bvf7em,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/bvf7em/feeding_while_st/,1,1559379159.0,"I posted not an hour ago and here I am posting again. 

It’s our first night trying Ferber for my 5mo daughter. 

I think I messed up because I fed her too early.  We don’t have a feeding schedule as she’s never taken to one. Some days she eats more and some less. I throw out a lot of formula that she won’t eat. 
Today, she woke up at 4PM and ate at 5PM. 
For the last couple of weeks she’s been falling asleep around 9PM and I thought she might have another nap around 6. ( her naps are usually 35-40 minutes long). 

Well she never had another nap but was showing all the cues. I tried to put her down with her pacifier (the pacifier association is what I’m trying to break with Ferber. She’s been a great sleeper otherwise. Wakes up twice a night to dream feed. But last couple of night have been torture with her waking up for two hours between 3-6am). 
She didn’t want to sleep with the pacifier so I started the routine. Tried feeding her around 6:30 and she didn’t want a drop. 
Gave her a bath, sang a song and put her down. 
She cried. A lot. Took me an hour to get her to sleep. 
But towards the end I noticed that she would sleep for 20-30 seconds and wake up again. After a couple of cycles of this I decided to feed her. 
Picked her up, fed her. I made sure she was awake when I put her back down and I watched on the monitor as she fell asleep on her own. 

Now my question is how much did I mess up with feeding her when I did? I’m pretty sure she wouldn’t have fallen asleep unless she ate because it was 3 hours since she ate last and she only ate about 2.5oz. 

I’m hoping to feed her closer to 6:30 tomorrow and put her down at the same time as tonight.","Feeding while ST!I posted not an hour ago and here I am posting again.

I plan to confirm this with her pediatrician at her 6 month appointment but given my daughter's health and weight gain (both excellent) I'm confident the pediatrician will give us the go ahead to just feed once a night at six months.

Ideally I would like her to wake to eat between 3-4 because this gives her the best chance of making it through to a 7am wake up. So how do I do this? Just let her cry until the desired time? Let her cry again if she wakes after her one nightly feed?

Night 5 CIO progress regression?,sleeptrain,3,bv5dx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/bv5dx2/night_5_cio_progress_regression/,4,1559323695.0,"We’re on night 5 of CIO for our little one, 5 months old. The first 4 nights went great. It was clear that he needed his own space and own crib. We saw a great improvement in the amount of time and ease it took for him to fall asleep on his own, stay asleep, and settle himself back down if he awoke before a feeding.

Our first four nights went like this: fall asleep after 15 minutes of crying, wake up briefly 2 hours later, cry it out on his own for less than 10 minutes, back to sleep until 2.5-3.5 hours later for first night feeding and diaper change. After first feeding, asleep for another 3ish- maybe 4 hours until second feeding, back to sleep for another 2 ish hours, then up for the day. We had very minimal crying after he would fall asleep the first time.

Last night, we started our routine about a half an hour later than usual because he took a later than usual nap (probably my first giant mistake). He went down sooooo easily last night. He barely cried and fell asleep beautifully. He was awake screaming 3 hours later. We tried to let him CIO for a few minutes but figured that he was hungry since he hasn’t cried that hard in the middle of the night since we started training. I fed him, put him back down awake, until he woke up after another 3 hours with the same loud, robust, screaming cry. We let him cry for 30 minutes until he fell back asleep on his own. He then woke up an hour later, again, scream crying, where I came in and fed him for the second time and changed his diaper. He cried much more than usual when I set him back down drowsy but awake. The last 4 nights, he really wouldn’t cry at all when I set him down after middle of the night feedings.

He’s been eating more during the day, as I’ve been trying to stay cognizant of his need for extra calories to help his sleep stretches. (He used to nurse practically all night before sleep training began).

Is this normal? Did I screw it up with the late nap and later bedtime? Is he simply just hungrier tonight than previous nights? Although being hungrier doesn’t explain the increased crying after setting him down drowsy after a feeding...

Editing to add that check-ins don’t seem to help or worsen things for baby, so we kind of just play it by ear, sometimes checking in after a while with quick pats and calming words.","Night 5 CIO progress regression?We’re on night 5 of CIO for our little one, 5 months old.

My son had a big case of FOMO (fear of missing out) he would not go to sleep at night without crying. I would do a whole 0 bedtime routine but as soon as we went into the bedroom he would start crying. As we had paper thin walls in our apartment (have since moved) I felt awful letting him cry. I couldn't handle it emotionally to leave him in the dark and I wanted to be able to say to out neighbors that we are there for him. 

My method of training him is a bit different, I rocked him to sleep in complete darkness, no sound, no light, no nursing, but in my arms in the rocker. He would cry hard for 10 mins max (we are lucky) at first the calm down and be willing to go to sleep. I would cry with him most of the time but I knew I was there for him, no way could he feel abandoned, and I knew he was safe. After a few nights he would calm down within a few mins of rocking and I could put him down awake or asleep. Soon it became or routine and he was easy to put to bed. 

Now  at 18 months we do our bath and play/read until sleepy cues. I pick him up, he chugs water, I close the curtains, turn on his red light/white noise machine. We then do hugs and kisses and then he leans towards his crib. I put him down, he blows kisses and says bye bye. We blow kisses back and say bye bye, close the door and he rolls over and goes to sleep. Easiest kid ever, we are lucky but it did take some tears from both of us but now we have an easy sleeper. I wish you all success and long sleep filled nights, success is not defined by one path but by the one path that is right for you and your baby.","Success with a low cry methodDisclaimer- we were lucky

8 month old still a terrible sleeper. FTM.

My 8 month old will only nap for 40ish mins or less, and when we lay her down for bed at night in her crib she only sleeps for 1-3 hours at the most before waking up. If we try to lay her back down in her crib, she’s up again in less than 30 mins, often 5 mins. So I gave up after going through hell for months and now I bring her to my bed after this first wimpy stretch of sleep. 

Wake times are 2 hours, 3 hours, then about 4 hours before bed. Sometimes I hold her to make one of her naps longer during the day or else she’s so whiny bc she’s still tired (since she only sleeps for maybe 40 mins, sometimes less), and if not then she needs 3 naps which makes her bedtime so late to meet the appropriate wake window after that nap. 

We’ve had nearly the same bedtime routine since she was 2 mos old: bath, diaper, massage, PJs, bottle of pumped milk, books. 

She was a decent sleeper until she was 3.5 mos old bc I was doing all the “right things” I learned in the Taking Cara Babies classes I took, but then it changed and we went through 2.5 months of absolute nightmare nights which is when we eventually started co-sleeping after her first wake up of the night, and I developed a bad habit of nursing to sleep. I swear these new habits were out of absolute necessity and they did save my sanity, and even if her dad puts her to sleep without nursing it’s the same story. 

I briefly tried pick up put down (no difference in sleep) and tonight I let her cry for 20 mins with two checks and I just couldn’t handle it. She was crying so hard she couldn’t catch her breath.

Naps are a different story. She only naps on me and refuses to nap in her bassinet or crib.

I'm wondering if it'll be too confusing and I should either nap train in the bassinet in the bedroom and transition to the nursery later when she moves there for nights or just wait to nap train in the nursery when she moves there for night sleeping.

We're going into night 6 of Ferber method and I've noticed small improvements night over night, for the most part. The one thing we seem to be struggling with is after about 1 am (when I feed her), she'll cycle between ~10 minutes of crying/fussing and then ~10 minutes of quiet, and so on.

I'm never really sure if I should go check on her or not because just when I am about to, she quiets down, but then starts back up 10 minutes later.

She also has a really hard time going back to sleep after 4 or 5 am, but that's probably a whole other story...

Has anyone experienced this and how did you handle it? Or, does anyone have any recommendations for how to approach it?

Baby is 7 months old and very small so I'm trying to still feed her 1-2 times a night, generally around 1 and 4. I wait until she wakes up and it’s been at least 3.5-4 hours since I last fed her.

We just finished doing a week of sleep training that went quite well. We created a nap and bedtime routine, and then did progressively longer intervals of going in to comfort him (up to 10min max, never had to go that high I think 8 was the longest interval we got to that week.) 

We were triumphant and so proud that we were able to get rid of the swaddle, the pacifier and transition him to the crib, and he went from waking every 45mins to one or two wake ups per night! 

Now, all of a sudden he’s back sliding and resisting the process. He now REFUSES to nap. He’s been up since 7am, it’s currently 1:10. He’s clearly exhausted but I’m getting all the way up to the 10minute interval and having to reset. 

Here’s what I’ve been doing at nap time: 

Nap Time Routine 

-breast feed 

-burp

-change and lotion rub

-lights out and white noise machine on

-sing a ~2min song in rocking chair while snuggling. (Not always the same song, I cycle through a few.)

-lay him down in crib with stuffed animal and stroke his head while singing a short “sleepy song”, (~20sec).

-say “sleepy time, I love you!” And leave the room (Usually he starts to wine at this point) 

-set 4minute timer. 

-If he’s still crying when timer goes off I go in and stroke his head again while making shushing sounds to the same rhythm as the “sleepy song”. (This is about 50/50 whether it calms him or not.) i then whisper “sleepy time, I love you” and leave the room. 

-add a minute to the timer and repeat the process. 

-If the timer is up to 10minutes and he still didnt get to sleep during that 10min interval I pick him up for a ”reset”.

-reset: carry and snuggle till he calms, play with him for ~15 minutes, then restart the routine. 


The last few days I’ve been having to continually reset his naps 2-3 times, which means I end up fighting him all day basically spending the whole day trying to get him to nap. The naps and feedings start overlapping and I get super stressed out cuz I can’t get anything done. This sucks! I miss my friendly smiley little guy but he can’t play, or listen to books or dance or sing he is too exhausted! It feels like we’re torturing each other! He’s lovely right in the morning when he wakes up we get 2-3 good hours before I try to put him down and he’s a wreck again for the rest of the day. I’ve tried shortening the interval between naps but that seems to make him more furious... back when he was being more normal 2-3 hours seemed to be the sweet spot for awake time any longer than that and he gets over tired. 

When he does actually manage to get to sleep he wakes up again at the slightest noise and wakes up after 30-45 minutes no matter what and won’t go back down. He has no sleep associations left and seems able to soothe himself back to sleep at night so what is his deal? He’s then grouchy and tired cuz the nap wasn’t long enough and it screws up our whole routine. I feel trapped at home because I am spending so much time and energy working around “nap time” which never seems to end. :( 

Daily Routine (estimated, of course I shift this as necessary based on his behaviour, but this is generally the plan.)

7:00 wake up and feed

9:30 Start nap routine

10:00-12:00 nap

Am I doing something wrong? Any advice or alternate methods I should try? Thanks so much for reading all this and for any help you can offer.

We have an 11.5 month old who has a seven thirty bedtime and regularly gets between two and three hours of nap time a day. However, he consistently wakes up every morning between five and five thirty. He also will have a night waking around midnight/one am every other day, which I'll go shh him for and he usually falls back to sleep within an hour, and he also has a waking between two and three when he gets a night feed. This all adds up to about eleven hours of sleep total every day, which seems like enough for him, and he never seems too tired during the day.

So do we just live with the early wake time, or should we push for a later bedtime (eight or eight thirty?) That just seems super late for a one year old.","Early waking but plenty of sleepHi,

He goes down for naps with hardly any fuss and I use age appropriate wake times/tired cues to determine nap times. Everyday, no matter what time my son wakes up, his last nap will end around 4:00-4:30pm. He typically naps for a total of four hours in a day, spread over 4-5 naps. He follows an eat/play/sleep rhythm. So for bedtime, I like to follow an 1.5-2 hours wake time for the last window of wake time. My son is always showing heavy tired cues around 5:30pm.

We sleep trained around 4 months (extinction), gave up after 2 weeks of poor results, then started over around 5mo. Relatively smooth sailing since, including naps.

LO just turned 1, so we are trying to drop the binky. He only uses it for sleep and car seat as it is, but we want to cut it out completely this summer. His daycare “year” runs til June 15 or so, and the night binky-throwing-then-wailing-til-help-comes was getting annoying, so we decided to start with nighttime first. So 1 month ago we stopped giving the binky at nighttime. He handled it well and after 3 days of CIO he was pretty much down to crying for 5-10m when put in bed. He still gets it for naps when he’s at daycare, but we’ve dropped it for home naptime also.

The problem is, he can’t go back to sleep in the early mornings anymore. He WAS waking up at 6:35 when he heard our alarm going off in the next room, or sometimes sleeping in all the way til 7 (about 25% of the time).

Since we cut out binky at night, he is waking up at 5:15. 😭

I wondered if it was just a coincidence, an unfortunately timed sleep regression. But the other morning I was exhausted from a night playing Zelda...so at 5am when he started wailing and didn’t go back to sleep after 20m I went and gave him a binky (I was weak!) and he went back to sleep for another hour.

Has anyone else experienced this? Is it just the end of 6:30 mornings, and I need to become a 5:15 person?

Our baby is 4.5 months old. I've been working on gently teaching him to go to sleep on his own for the last two months. It wasn't working- it was taking 30+ minutes to put him down at night, and (the bigger problem) he was waking every 1.5-2 hours.

10 days ago we started more formal sleep training, letting him cry with checks every 5,10, then 15 minutes. We had high hopes as this worked very well for our daughter (though we started closer to 6 months with her). We've done our best to be consistent with the method, though it's hard.

My problem is that we're not seeing much improvement at bedtime. It takes him anywhere from 5 to 45 minutes to fall asleep at bedtime, and only twice has it been 5 minutes or less at bedtime. It's also not like the crying gets less every night- the last 4 nights have been 5, 27, 17, 40 minutes (tonight i jumped in at 40 minutes and rocked him to sleep, which I probably shouldn't have).

Nights are better- he wakes 3 times to eat, goes back down without much fussing, and sleeps in a bit later.

I've tinkered a lot with hi daytime schedule, without much effect. A typical day: wake 6:45. Nap 1 8:45-9:30. Nap 2 11:30-2. Nap 3 4:15-5. Last feed (breastfed) at 6:30, then Pjs/book/song, and bed 7:30.

Bottom line...We're trying to figure out where to go from here. We don't want to lose the progress we have made, but I also feel like we've tried this method long enough, and that it's clearly not right for him. After a long discussion, our tentative plan is to shorten the intervals for check ins to 3-6-9-12-15 minutes. We discussed full extinction also, which we just don't feel right about, especially since he is rather young. Any other ideas for us?

8 month sleep regression - will I regret giving paci back at night?,sleeptrain,1,btti32,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/btti32/8_month_sleep_regression_will_i_regret_giving/,9,1559032254.0,"We have an 8 month old who is overall an amazing sleeper. She has been sleeping through the night since 10 weeks and falling asleep independently at bedtime since we sleep trained at 4 months. We stopped using a paci at bedtime a long time ago because she had a brief period of waking for the paci to be reinserted. She does use a paci for naps without a problem, and occasionally uses one during the day but we have been intentionally cutting back on using it during awake time. 

I guess we have hit the “8 month sleep regression” because she is suddenly screaming at bedtime like she did during sleep training. Tonight was night 4 of 30+ minutes of screaming. She’s also been waking early (though thankfully going back to sleep) and was awake from 2-3 am one night too which is completely abnormal for her. 

Two of the last 4 nights we have caved and given her a pacifier and she has then fallen asleep within 5 minutes. If the paci falls out she can find it and put it back in herself. Am I going to regret this in the future if we give her back a paci at night? Any other tips to help her stop screaming at bedtime? 

Her schedule is:

- 6-6:30 wake but we don’t usually get her up til 6:45 
- 8:45-10:05 nap (she is a clock - 1 hr 21 min nap every time) 
- 1ish nap for 1 hr 40 min-2 hour
- bedtime sometime between 6 and 7 depending on when her nap ended; we aim to have her asleep after 3.5 hours which was always the sweet spot until a few days ago 

I know that’s a lot of total sleep but she has always been on the high end of sleep needs and was very much thriving on this schedule. But I also recognize things can change as she gets older. I don’t love putting her to bed at 7 because then it is past 7 when she falls asleep and if she goes to bed past 7 she always wake up in the 5 am hour.","8 month sleep regression - will I regret giving paci back at night?We have an 8 month old who is overall an amazing sleeper. She has been sleeping through the night since 10 weeks and falling asleep independently at bedtime since we sleep trained at 4 months. We stopped using a paci at bedtime a long time ago because she had a brief period of waking for the paci to be reinserted. She does use a paci for naps without a problem, and occasionally uses one during the day but we have been intentionally cutting back on using it during awake time. 

I guess we have hit the “8 month sleep regression” because she is suddenly screaming at bedtime like she did during sleep training. Tonight was night 4 of 30+ minutes of screaming. She’s also been waking early (though thankfully going back to sleep) and was awake from 2-3 am one night too which is completely abnormal for her. 

Two of the last 4 nights we have caved and given her a pacifier and she has then fallen asleep within 5 minutes. If the paci falls out she can find it and put it back in herself. Am I going to regret this in the future if we give her back a paci at night? Any other tips to help her stop screaming at bedtime? 

Her schedule is:

- 6-6:30 wake but we don’t usually get her up til 6:45 
- 8:45-10:05 nap (she is a clock - 1 hr 21 min nap every time) 
- 1ish nap for 1 hr 40 min-2 hour
- bedtime sometime between 6 and 7 depending on when her nap ended; we aim to have her asleep after 3.5 hours which was always the sweet spot until a few days ago

I have a 10-week old that was born 4lbs 10oz and 18"" long, with no complications besides being a skinny shrimp. The Dr's orders have been to just feed him and get his weight up which we've been able to do. He's now 10 weeks old and doubled his weight and height (hooray!). 

&#x200B;

So what's the problem? The typical milestones for the amount he's supposed to be eating during a feeding only make sense if he was born twice as big. So at night he rarely sleeps more than 3 hours at a time before waking up insanely hungry. Will that mean sleep-training will take longer or have to be delayed because he'll have more night feedings?

Thankfully there's a level of predictability emerging here for when his night sleep finally starts but I'd really like to know when I can start training him legitimately.","Born Full Term but Tiny, When Do I Start Training?I just found this group and am so happy it exists!

Questions on night wakings!,sleeptrain,4,btg3c9,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/btg3c9/questions_on_night_wakings/,7,1558949991.0,"I apologize if these questions are redundant in this sub- I tried searching and couldn’t find exactly what I was looking for.

We are sleep training my EBF 5 month old after getting the ok from our pediatrician. Tonight is our first official night of extinction. I half-assed it on and off. I gave in to multiple night wakings with feedings until I eventually would bring him into bed with us in the early morning to just comfort nurse until he woke up. It was the only way we would both get sleep. I realized this wasn’t helping him at all, and our lack of commitment was just resulting in him crying for no good reason. I wasn’t planning on even considering it until 6 months but he is just ready- can’t get comfortable while bed sharing, wants to sprawl out in his co-sleeper bassinet but gets woken up with every little sound or if he splays his arms out and smacks his hand into the side of the bassinet. It makes me sad that it’s already happening, but at the same time, I’m glad that this feels like it’s on his own terms.

Like I said, we are going the extinction route for efficiency’s sake. My babe usually eats every 2 hours during the day, sometimes more often, which I know is just comfort feeding, but he dealt with some shitty protein allergies that didn’t get diagnosed until he was 2 months that left us with a miserable, colicky, uncomfortable bubs and, as a result, nursing is just his go-to.

My questions are:
1. Does feeding every four hours seem reasonable for a 5 month old baby used to feeding every 2 hours at least during the day? He nurses so often at night that I couldn’t even measure it. The longest he slept before the 4 month sleep regression was 5 hours... once. He’s done a few 4 hour stretches (before the dreaded regression hit).
2. How do night wakings work? Do I go in and dream feed him every 4 hours or do I wait until he wakes up after 4 hours from the last feeding to nurse? Is nursing him when he wakes up crying, even if it’s been a few hours, just indulging his cry and causing a habit?
3. What if baby falls asleep during night feedings? Is he supposed to continually go back down awake, even after night feedings? Bubs is usually half asleep when I nurse him at night and I can’t imagine him staying awake enough for me to put him back in his crib “drowsy but awake” in the middle of the night. 

Thanks for whoever reads this! Can I also just say this fucking sucks? I have to go recite my damn affirmations now.","Questions on night wakings!I apologize if these questions are redundant in this sub- I tried searching and couldn’t find exactly what I was looking for.

What does extinction look like for you - 1 year old & breaking night nursing,sleeptrain,5,bt8mdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/bt8mdq/what_does_extinction_look_like_for_you_1_year_old/,7,1558910239.0,"Back story: I have an older child who I nursed to sleep for the first year, then did pick up/put down after bedtime routine one time and she’s slept through ever since. I was hoping the same would happen for my current 1yo (hah!) but he can’t seem to drop the night nursing. My husband has tried with little to no success for hours to get him to sleep when he wakes and then eventually in desperation, we nurse and he either finally sleeps or is awake for another 1-1.5 hours before crashing. I didn’t want to resort to extinction, but that seems to be where we’re heading. My question is, what does that look like to you?

Current routine is brush teeth, put older sis to bed with books, songs, hugs/kisses and then hang out reading for 30 mins until sleepy cues (yawn, heavy eyelids, decreased activity), then either nurse or walk to sleep (sometimes he doesn’t fall asleep while nursing or refuses the breast). Usually asleep by 8:30-9 (wish it could be earlier, but usually not tired and I have older sis to get to sleep on my own). He goes to sleep well, and usually doesn’t wake until 2-4 in the morning then not again until 645-730, so it’s not the amount of sleep I’m getting that’s bothering me, it’s the nursing. I’m DONE. It’s very painful during ovulation and my period, so I would like to quit. I’ve tried offering water, I’ve tried sending my husband in, tried Ferber (which makes him irate and he takes hours to fall asleep I think due to the tease of the check-ins and he never calms during the check-ins.

Our bedtime routine works ok for me, especially if I’m able to walk him to sleep (usually just takes about 10-15 mins), so has anyone had success with extinction only in the middle of the night? Or do I HAVE to get him to sleep initially with extinction? How long do you go before you feel extinction isn’t working? How many hours of crying? For Days? Weeks? How do you know for sure that nothing is wrong (teeth, poopy diaper, ears hurt) - I think this will be my biggest issue sticking with it because once he gets hysterical, it’s hard to tell the difference in cries. And what do you do about your older children? My oldest can’t sleep with a noise machine on - the sound bothers her. She usually doesn’t wake with her brother’s shorter crying spells at night, but when we’ve tried Ferber for longer periods, she says she woke up in the night. Her room shares a wall with his. Is there a quieter noise machine (use a dohm in her brother’s room) that is still effective? Sorry for the novel. I’m trying to prepare myself for all situations so that I can successfully try this method without doubts. 

Tl;dr how do you implement extinction (at bedtime or only night wakings)? How long do you let them cry/how do you know if something is actually wrong (poopy diaper) vs. protest? How long do you continue with the method before deciding it’s not working for you?

We did CIO with our 5 month old. It was painful but worked! We had some rough patches later but eventually realized it was teething and we got over it. 

So sleep training worked mostly well enough and all was good. 

Until our baby’s dermatologist decided to put her on Propranolol for a hemangioma (it was risking disfigurement so we had to treat it)

Well, my baby is apparently one of the small percentage who experience sleep disruption ( at least that’s that most minor of the side affects!). We stopped the CIO since it wasn’t fair when it was the meds (in consultation with our pediatrician)

We tried a few things including going onto the name brand. We couldn’t tell for sure how she was doing since the training was caput but she still didn’t sleep amazingly

We switched to a medicine that has no sleep side affects and after a week, we’re back at training. We just had 1:40 of crying then she fell asleep for 20 min. She then woke up, cried for 10 min and is now asleep sitting up (who knew babies could do that)

To make a long story as short as possible:

I took 2 baby sleep classes and baby was doing fairly well learning to sleep alone, slept through the night for 2 weeks, then when she hit 3.5 mos old all hell broke loose. Slept one 3ish hour stretch then was up every 45 mins and for 2-4 hours straight losing her damn mind, and I was losing mine too. 

After 2.5 months of this nightly nightmare and sleep-deprived induced PPD hell, we started co-sleeping which saved my sanity. We also somehow fell into the routine of nursing to sleep for naps and nighttime. Oops. But at least I started feeling human again. 

Baby is 8 mos old tomorrow, and sleep has been getting worse again for a few weeks. We have a good nighttime routine and she starts the night out in her bed around 7ish, sleeps for 1-3 hours, then we can’t successfully get her back to sleep in her own bed so she co-sleeps...where she won’t go to sleep without my boob in her mouth. She’s up for 2 times after this, and for a 1-hour stretch each night restless. Then wakes at 6am. 

I’m tired and achy (co-sleeping+breastfeeding is hard on the body), and dad is annoyed and wants to sleep train. I’m conflicted for two reason: not sure I can handle letting her cry, and also afraid this will end our breastfeeding relationship and my supply will dry up (she’s had a TON of feeding issues and for whatever reason will only breastfeed during the night, which was devastating to me, so I have to pump during the day). She’s not a great eater and only drinks about 20oz during the day, and doesn’t eat much solids yet. So she probably would still need a night feed anyways. 

Oh and her naps are lame. She won’t go to sleep for me without my boob in her mouth for comfort, but even if her dad or Mimi puts her to sleep, she only sleeps for maybe 45 mins. Sometimes I hold her to make it longer. 

Suggestions?! Help?! Encouragement?! I’m so tired of trying to figure this out myself. This is my first baby and I just don’t know what to do anymore. 🤦🏼‍♀️","Advice Wanted for 8 mo old Co-Sleeping/Nursing New MomDad wants to sleep train, I’m conflicted...

If I heard that at 2am coming from a neighbors apartment I would be tempted to call the police, which is what we’re legitimately worried is going to happen.

Dear Neighbor,

We would like to request your patience and understanding for the next couple of days as we sleep train our 1 year old. Unfortunately we don’t have an easy sleeper on our hands and it seems that “cry it out” is our only hope. Ideally it should take less than a week with the first night being the worst and each night getting progressively better.

I’m a STM to a happy and cuddly (but not clingy) 3.5 month old. He may be on the young side, but he’s hefty 😂. He’s over 15 pounds as of last week and over 26 inches tall. I have faith in his ability to begin sleep training soon if not immediately. 

Our major issue is not the time it takes to fall asleep (usually less than 5 minutes rocking in my arms) but that he wakes more than necessary for sure. He sleeps in his own room in his crib in a sleep sack. He uses a pacifier too. He’ll go to bed around 6:30pm and he’ll wake at midnight to feed. Sometimes he wakes around 10pm and needs a to be comforted back to sleep, not fed. He’ll wake again around 2-3am and this is where the trouble starts. I’m so groggy but I diligently change him then feed him. From there, he’s up almost every hour. Last night it seemed like he wanted to party at 2:30am. I’m losing my mind. I almost always end up holding him or co sleeping at 4 or 5 am because I’m exhausted and I have a 2 year old who wakes at 7am. He’s also up for at least 45 minutes each time even though he only eats for about 10-15 minutes. I’m def keeping 1-2 feeds because he’s so young, but I’d like to not have to hold him for 15 minutes to make sure he’s ok to transfer to the crib. He likes to be held for sure and I’m wondering if his pacifier is an issue and I’m not getting to him in time to put it back so he’ll drift off. His naps are usually only 30-45 minutes but I’m not concerned about those because I know it’s developmentally appropriate. 

His wake periods are a bit wonky because we’re out of the house almost every week day from 9am-12pm so sometimes it’s over 2 hours before he falls asleep. His sister wasn’t like this at all, she was hard to get to sleep but stayed that way and only woke to eat twice a night and passed out immediately after. We ferberized her at 3.5 months for night and naps which worked beautifully and she’s an amazing sleeper. 

Very long winded tale short, my questions are: 

1.  How can I help him get better at staying asleep for longer than 2 hours in the early morning? 

2. Should I take away the pacifier?

3. I have the opportunity to begin sleep training (likely Ferber) tonight (husband has a 4 day weekend) terrible idea or go for it?

4. Do I need to change him each time or is it just waking him further? We cloth diaper if this is pertinent. I may switch to disposables overnight. 

I may not be asking all the right questions or not know something is a problem when it actually is.

How did you teach your kid to fall asleep on their own?,sleeptrain,2,bs4ebx,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/bs4ebx/how_did_you_teach_your_kid_to_fall_asleep_on/,13,1558654485.0,"My baby can't self-soothe...

How did you teach your LO to sleep? 

My experience is very similar to other posts on this sub...

&#x200B;

We moved 6 month old baby girl out of her bassinet three weeks ago and she's now learning to sleep in her crib. There has been VERY mild success, she has slept through the night one or two times, which was shocking to us. By sleep through the night, I mean she only woke up one time at 5:30, nursed and went back to sleep until 8 am on a Saturday.

&#x200B;

For the last two weeks, she is very difficult to put down and will sleep for an hour before crying again, we will get up to rock her back to sleep, then we rotate, she'll sleep for another hour. I am so weak, she never sleeps in her crib for me, so I bring her to bed. Similar to other posters here, she doesn't sleep well in bed with me, and neither do I. She kicks and fusses, at most we get 2-3 hours in bed, but I am desperate for that sleep.

&#x200B;

My husband is much better at getting her to sleep in the crib. We do not nurse to sleep--We Eat, Play, Sleep

&#x200B;

I'm trying to get her used to crib sleeping during the day. For her 9-11 nap, I rock her to sleep and put her down after 30 minutes, but it never works! She always wakes up and we start all over. The morning naps aren't so desperate, but by the afternoon nap, I am so anxious to get her to sleep before the evening-time, she can 100% sense the desperation and she fusses a lot. Sometimes she won't sleep at all in the afternoon until her dad gets home and rocks her, those are very desperate times for me.

&#x200B;

I checked out multiple books at the library, most of them ""no cry"" sleep solutions. We have not started solids, yesterday we gave her a little banana and it was cute, but we aren't there 100% yet.

Loose schedule:

UP at 7:00am

Catnap 5:30ish

Bedtime at 7 or 8

Then UP allll night again...I'd love to say we stick to the routine, but we don't. We go to baby playgroups and events...she will fall asleep in the car sometimes..She used to sleep much better until recently, she came online and is so curious about the world.

We moved 6 month old baby girl out of her bassinet three weeks ago and she's now learning to sleep in her crib. There has been VERY mild success, she has slept through the night one or two times, which was shocking to us. By sleep through the night, I mean she only woke up one time at 5:30, nursed and went back to sleep until 8 am on a Saturday.

&#x200B;

For the last two weeks, she is very difficult to put down and will sleep for an hour before crying again, we will get up to rock her back to sleep, then we rotate, she'll sleep for another hour. I am so weak, she never sleeps in her crib for me, so I bring her to bed. Similar to other posters here, she doesn't sleep well in bed with me, and neither do I. She kicks and fusses, at most we get 2-3 hours in bed, but I am desperate for that sleep.

My husband is much better at getting her to sleep in the crib. We do not nurse to sleep--We Eat, Play, Sleep

How did you all do it?!?!

Night 1:
In bedroom at 6 or so. Read book
Put in sleeping bag
Put bub in cot
Laid there for about 5 mins before protest crying began 
Protest cry for 5 then emotional cry for 3. Tried to settle in cot but did not work.
Used pick up put down method
Immediate emotional cry
Did this a few times
Left for 2 mins
Asleep 1 min later at 6.35

Woke at 7:05
Left to protest cry
Slowly got worse after the 11 minute mark
Settled a few times then cried each time I put her back down.
Crying finally stopped at 7:59 for less than a minute then resumed.
Stopped at 8:01 then fell asleep

Dream feed at 10:00


12:45woke for 5 mins and settled back to sleep
 
1:55- Woke up 
Cried for half an hour. Feed and immediately asleep at 2:30

Awake at 8am!

I don’t want to sleep train for that long yet but I’d like to sleep train so he sleeps for 7-8 hours without a feed. I am so sleep deprived I can barely function.

My son goes to bed at 7:30 pm and wakes up at 6:30 am (I feed him twice during that time although he doesn’t eat much for the first feeding. He wakes up a lot more times than that but I soothe him back to sleep). Im thinking I can do: 

1. Dream feed at 10:30 or 11 pm and do CIO until 6:30 am. (Planning on doing The Happy Sleeper way which is check ins every 5 minutes).

2. Do the long stretch of sleep at the beginning of the night and do CIO if he wakes between 7:30 pm and 2:30 or 3:30 am or so. Then feed when he wakes up after that time.

The pros of the dream feed is that the CIO would be consistent. The other way I let him cry for any wakeups until it’s past 2:30 or 3:30 am and then I would feed at that time. I feel like that might be confusing for him? Sometimes coming to him and feeding if he cries but not other times...

The pro of the other method though is that I heard the first stretch of sleep is the best for babies so a dreamfeed might disrupt his sleep cycle. And that method he might eventually drop the other night time feed when his body is ready.

How do I start to sleep train? And not nurse to sleep?,sleeptrain,9,brsim9,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/brsim9/how_do_i_start_to_sleep_train_and_not_nurse_to/,24,1558579639.0,Okay. So I’m trying to get LO to only wake up for one night feed. He’s almost 7 months old. He currently wakes up about 4x a night to either eat or be comforted back to sleep and I’m over it. He only wants to sleep while being held which obvs won’t work for us. I usually get up and feed him twice before 3am and get him back to sleep in his crib. At 3am every night he refuses to go back in his crib. He’ll be asleep in my arms/nursing and the second he hits the crib his eyes open. No matter what I do I can’t get him to sleep in his crib after 3am. What am I doing wrong?! I’m thinking I need to reduce night feeds to just once at three am. The problem is every time he wakes up he starts crying. He sometimes wakes up and plays a bit but it always ends in tears (I don’t go to him unless he’s crying bc I’m unrealistically hopeful he’ll fall back asleep on his own). But I always end up bringing him to our bed at 3 bc I’m tired and have to wake up at 6 so I give up. I just don’t know how to get him back asleep on his own. But I can’t keep this up much longer.

It could be that she's teething and getting a too tooth.

The program we were recommended to implement, in my view, is too intense and not necessarily suited to all babies. Aside from nighttime cry-it-out (which I actually am fine with), here is what I don't agree with:

-Baby should be taking two 2-hour naps + a third shorter nap each day. Obviously that would be great if it happened, but if baby wakes during these long naps, let him cry for at least 30 minutes, preferably longer, as long as 45, 60, or an hour and fifteen minutes in order to give him a chance to fall back asleep. 

-Baby needs those naps to go well (at least 4 hours of daytime sleep) and if they don't (if the naps are too short or the third nap is missed) he must be in bed by 5:30pm.

The 5:30pm bedtime is earlier than the earliest bedtime I have ever seen recommended anywhere else. Our baby has been going down at 5:30pm daily and he routinely wakes and cries the following early morning from 5am-6:30am when we get him up for the day. I find it hard to believe this isn't due to the super early bedtime. And as for the naps, I find this unnecessarily harsh and the returns are pretty limited, and it reportedly could take weeks for this to work. The whole appeal of cry-it-out for nighttime is that it's a few brutal nights and then things should have improved. Who wants to do cry-it-out twice a day for six weeks? I personally think this is a bad method. His naps are often too short, but he has long ones occasionally, and I expect/hope this nap consolidation will improve with age. Is it really sound advice to tell parents to let a baby scream for 60 minutes after baby has woken from a 35-minute nap? I know such a short nap isn't ideal, but I'd much rather say ""Oh well, I hope the next one is longer."" I think it's fair to say that doing it this way is not necessary, but it's an option, and an extreme one at that.

Grumble.


UPDATE: I made this post in a fit of pique. While I stand by my criticism of the cry-it-out for naps method, I have to admit that the 5:30pm bedtime has actually worked well, and I cannot credibly blame this for his early morning wake-up/crying sessions, which are incredibly common among babies and were something that he was doing even back when we had him on a 7:30pm bedtime. He's at daycare now and thus not logging enough daytime nap hours, so it's a 5:30pm bedtime for now, but if that improves, perhaps we'll begin to push it to 6pm or 6:30pm. In short, 5:30pm bedtime not as crazy as I thought.","Am I right?We hired a professional to help us sort out our 5 month old's sleep.

I’m struggling currently with setting an attainable and repeatable schedule for my 8-month old son, though. 

Right now he goes to bed at 7:30PM, we dream feed at 10:00PM, then we either have one night feed at 4:00AM or 6:00AM, it varies. Wake-up is sometimes 7:30AM and sometimes as late as 8:45AM. 

The wake-up is the problem - Because it varies so much, the daytime naps are super weird and unpredictable. If he’s up at 7:30 then I have first nap at 11:00, but if he’s up at 8:45 I wait til noon. The first nap is also varying lengths, sometimes 45 minutes and sometimes as long as 3 hours, with no predictability. He’s a great sleeper, and wakes up jolly, but I feel like I’m doing him and me a disservice in having this wonky schedule. He’s been napping terribly at daycare and I think if I can do something that’s more strict, he’ll be better overall.

That being said, what are some schedules that you’re currently implementing / implemented for 6-9 month olds?

Short naps -- these are your options!......Right?,sleeptrain,3,br1dvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/br1dvz/short_naps_these_are_your_optionsright/,12,1558415360.0,"Our 5 month old has undergone a number of sleep training attempts, with varying results (I'd say for night sleep, the result is always ""he's improved, but not really perfect as we had hoped for""). By now, he's not too bad: down for 12 hours at night and gets a 11pm dream feed, but is reliable for zero to two 3-minute cry/whimper sessions and almost always cries during that early morning stretch before wakeup time). We aim to improve, wean him off that feed, but I think he has done well! For daytime, he still can be characterized as a short napper, as he has been since birth. I'd say 60-70% of his naps are 35-60 minutes.  This leaves us with the following options as far as I can tell:

Option #1: When he wakes up, get him up and simply accept that he is a short napper, with 4 naps a day for now (because he's still ready for a nap after about 1.5-2 hours of being awake). 

Option #2: When he wakes up, leave him in the crib for another 30-60 minutes in the hopes that he falls back asleep. We've tried this and it's not pleasant. The results aren't strong enough or consistent enough to make it feel worth it. There's a heck of a lot more crying endlessly than falling back asleep :(  It's sort of like cry-it-out without any results!

Option #3: The middle ground, as in letting him cry for a shorter period when he wakes up...something like 10-15 minutes. It's a little more bearable, I still don't see him falling back asleep but we should at least give him a chance.

Option #4: Stretch those waking times. After 1.5-2 hours he starts yawning and showing signs of sleepiness, but instead of putting him down, maybe distract him in the hopes of keeping him awake and quiet long enough so that we can dwindle down to 3 naps a day instead of 4. Once we're doing 3 a day, maybe two of them will be nice and long?

As an addendum to Option #4, I can't decide what to think about the subject of waking time. The common knowledge is that a 5 month old shouldn't be awake longer than 2 hours, and that tracks with my experience (my little guy seems sleepy after 1.5-2 hours for sure).

Accidental sleep training tonight,sleeptrain,17,bqok3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/bqok3o/accidental_sleep_training_tonight/,7,1558342536.0,"I’ve been lurking this thread for advice awhile now and knew this was inevitable. 

Bub is 8mo and we finally moved him into his own room. It was a combination of him waking up more frequently and also my husband’s snoring/3:30am wake up for work bothering the baby. 

The bub moved from his bassinet next to our bed to a mini crib in our room at 4 mo with no issues. He seemed unfazed by the new bed with little fussing for a couple of weeks until he settled into it. 

We’ve been putting off moving him into his own room but finally did it. He needs his own space and a quiet place without possible interruptions from us and the cats. 

Well, we dived right in.  Put him down for his second nap today in the new room/crib. He was a bit confused but went down fine and slept his usual 30min. 

Then bedtime hit. We did our usual feeding, white noise machine and rocking (I know, I know...)
Ended up doing the routine twice because each time he was placed in the crib he woke up kinda confused and was wide awake. So, I told my husband we need to just leave him be and do timed checks. I fell back on all the advice I had read on here. 

After 2min, I checked on him. Put him back down, he cried again. Then I checked at 5min. Pick up/put down, reassured him I was always here if he needed me, and said good night. 

He immediately started crying again and I set the timer for 7min, feeling like an asshole but knowing I was doing the right thing. By 6min 30sec, he laid down and fell asleep! Holy crap! I couldn’t believe it. I was so nervous I was going to have to move him back into our room and try again next weekend. 

So, has anyone else experienced having to sleep train after moving rooms with baby? Is this normal? Should I expect it to happen again all week? Or will it get worse? 

Sorry for so many questions, I’m clearly new at this and kinda winging it, so I’m surprised by my results this far. Just wanting to prepare for the next week or two.

The bub moved from his bassinet next to our bed to a mini crib in our room at 4 mo with no issues. He seemed unfazed by the new bed with little fussing for a couple of weeks until he settled into it. 

We’ve been putting off moving him into his own room but finally did it. He needs his own space and a quiet place without possible interruptions from us and the cats. 

Well, we dived right in.  Put him down for his second nap today in the new room/crib. He was a bit confused but went down fine and slept his usual 30min. 

Then bedtime hit. We did our usual feeding, white noise machine and rocking (I know, I know...)
Ended up doing the routine twice because each time he was placed in the crib he woke up kinda confused and was wide awake. So, I told my husband we need to just leave him be and do timed checks. I fell back on all the advice I had read on here. 

After 2min, I checked on him. Put him back down, he cried again. Then I checked at 5min. Pick up/put down, reassured him I was always here if he needed me, and said good night. 

He immediately started crying again and I set the timer for 7min, feeling like an asshole but knowing I was doing the right thing. By 6min 30sec, he laid down and fell asleep! Holy crap! I couldn’t believe it. I was so nervous I was going to have to move him back into our room and try again next weekend. 

So, has anyone else experienced having to sleep train after moving rooms with baby? Is this normal? Should I expect it to happen again all week? Or will it get worse? 

Sorry for so many questions, I’m clearly new at this and kinda winging it, so I’m surprised by my results this far. Just wanting to prepare for the next week or two. Thanks in advance!!"
Baby Waking Up Screaming,sleeptrain,3,bqoaju,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/bqoaju/baby_waking_up_screaming/,14,1558340975.0,"My daughter is 4.5 months old and I’ve been implementing the eat wake sleep cycles for about 3 weeks now, before then I was feeding on demand. 

She was sleeping 8 hour stretches most nights until around 3.5 months, now she is waking every 2 hours throughout the night which I why I moved to the eat wake sleep cycles to ensure she is getting full feeds. 

She goes down awake for bedtime and naps, and we will let her fuss/coo/play to sleep and she can usually do this no problem. 

Some nights she can go 8 hours but most night the max is 4. Just recently, for about a week now she wakes up screaming, not just stirring awake and as soon as I pick her up she stops and then I can put her back down and she’s asleep. Sometimes it’s an hour after she goes down, sometimes it’s four hours after she’s gone down. 

A few times I’ve put her back down and she cries but falls back asleep. I’ve tried seeing what happens if I leave her to cry but she just gets more worked up and then won’t fall back asleep at all. I know she can connect sleep cycles because I have watched her lightly wake up and then go back to sleep on the baby monitor. 

Any ideas what might be happening?

She already has two teeth, and yes she may be teething but she does this even if I’ve given her baby Tylenol or baby Advil. 

We have eliminated all sleep props. 

This is her schedule

"Sleep training worked beautifully, but some questions about wake up time!",sleeptrain,7,bqigro,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/bqigro/sleep_training_worked_beautifully_but_some/,2,1558310008.0,"It took about 6-7 days and he's sleeping through the night at 9 months old. I am extremely thankful to this sub. 

Here comes his schedule and my concerns. Currently, his bedtime is around 8:00pm, but since he started sleeping through the night, mornings and naps are a bit unpredictable. If he wakes up at 5:00am, I nurse him, and he takes 40-50min to fall back asleep and sleeps until 8:00 - 8:30am. That means, dad won't see him before leaving for work (they used to hang out in the morning when I was catching up on sleep from 5+ night wake ups). If he wakes up at 6, I nurse him and he's up for the day but he'll be really tired very soon and will nap > 2 hours for the first nap. 

I prefer the second case, but I can't force him to not wake up at 5:00! Besides, with 6:00am wake up, I'm not sure if getting only 10 hours of night sleep is Ok for him. 

What are you suggesting? I'm not eager to move bedtime earlier again because of family time with dad in the evening unless it will mean a drastically healthier and happier sleep for little guy.

In any case, most important thing for me is consistency. Right now, there's a huge difference in the day schedule when he wakes up at 6:00am v.s. 8:30am and I can't plan anything because I won't know how the naps will look like! How can I work on getting that consistency? 

I never tried letting him cry at 5:00am. I don't know how he'll respond, but based on the fact that he's sleeping through the night happily, I think his 5:00am crying is a legitimate cry for breakfast or waking up.

Four Month Sleep Regression Nightmare,sleeptrain,11,bqf1oq,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/bqf1oq/four_month_sleep_regression_nightmare/,7,1558287514.0,"Im not sure if this is allowed here but... Help! I am completely at a loss. 

My little girl used to be the best sleeper. From week 6 until the day she turned 4 months, she would sleep 10-12 hours straight on her own. It was amazing. 

She is now 5 1/2 months and she is literally up every hour every night. I get about 30 minutes of sleep at a time. And even then, she is up and wide awake at about 6 am every morning, so I get maybe four or five thirty minute blocks of sleep at a time every night. I try napping but I feel like a zombie. Since she started this sleep regression thing I’ve gotten sick 3 times (I’ve got a terrible cold right now and I’m convinced it’s because I’m beyond exhausted). 

Anyway, I’ve tried so many different things (or, at least, that’s what it feels like). I’ve tried Cry It Out- nothing. I have her on the strict Babywise schedule (eat awake sleep). She only takes 3-4 naps a day. we have a very consistent bedtime routine. She usually goes to bed around 8 pm. I’ve tried earlier and later bedtimes, and that just makes her sleeping even worse. I’ve tried putting her down in her crib slightly awake so she can learn to self soothe. I’ve tried a pacifier. Nothing seems to work. 

Has anyone gone through this? Is there anything else I can do? If nothing else, does anyone have a pep talk? Thank you in advance 🙏🏻","Four Month Sleep Regression NightmareIm not sure if this is allowed here but... Help! I am completely at a loss.

For background, I have a 3 year old that has slept through the night since 10 months old when I did approx. 3 nights of CIO before that I didn't do any other type of sleep training but at that point was only waking up once a night, definitely out of habit.

My 7 month old is waking up twice a night.  His usual schedule is:

6ish: up for the day

9am-11 first nap

1:30is-3 second nap 

645-7ish down for the night.

He gets up twice usually around 11 or 12 and then again around 3 or 4.

When he goes down for the night he does great, he's breastfed but doesn't need to the boob to sleep, he does like his pacifier. Night time routine is usually sit down with the family while we eat (I've already fed him his solids at this point and milk) and then upstairs for book and a lullaby and he'll go right to sleep.

When he gets up at 11-12ish he's eat and then I can put him right back down and he'll go to sleep no problem.  Last night I tried ferber at the 11-12ish wake up at the 3 and 5 minute mark and it just riled him up more.  I tried to let him CIO, but he fussed and cried for an hour and half until I finally fed him and he went to sleep.  He woke up again at 5 ready to play and then wanted to finally sleep again when it was time to get up at 6:30.  

&#x200B;

I just don't know if he's ready to be night weaned?  Is he napping to long during the day? Both naps I usually have to wake him up once he's hit the 2 hour mark. He's a decent sized kid, 50% for weight and 70% for height.  Do I let him CIO longer?  Is there anything I'm missing?  He has never really slept longer than 5 hours at a time his entire life.
