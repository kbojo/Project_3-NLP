How to store clothes when seasons and weight are changing?,organizing,7,ddokyh,https://www.reddit.com/r/organizing/comments/ddokyh/how_to_store_clothes_when_seasons_and_weight_are/,1,1570317723.0,"Right now, I'm dealing with several types of clothing and wanted your advice on how to best organize them in my small closet (with shelves and hangers)


**Seasonal**

- Summer clothes as it's still hot

- Fall clothes as it's supposed to get colder


**Weight** (due to medication, my weight is increasing or decreasing depending on the month)

- Clothes that fit me now (fall and summer)

- Clothes that are slightly too big (fall and summer)

- Clothes that are slightly too small (fall and summer)


**My Plan**

My thought is to take all the clothes that are too small, and pack them in one box (regardless of season). Label it.

Then, pack the clothes that are slightly too big in a different box (regardless of season). Label it.


Then, look at the clothes that fit me now, and separate between fall and summer.  Keep these accessible.  Then as my weight shifts, I reach for the appropriate box.  


How does this sound? 


Thanks!"

Organizing important personal documents,organizing,3,czha3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/organizing/comments/czha3r/organizing_important_personal_documents/,2,1567608658.0,"I have divided my important personal documents into plastic file folders (the ones with the snap buttons) and then as inidividual plastic file sleeves within each file folder as follows:

* For each individual member of the family, a separate file folder
   * Passport(s) + 3 copies (each) of main page, residence visa (we are living as expats) + 1 copy each of all Schengen visas
   * National ID card(s) + 3 copies
   * Birth certificate(s) + 3 copies
   * Residence card(s) + 3 copies
   * Driver license(s) + 3 copies
   * University diploma(s) + 3 copies
* Common file folder
   * Marriage certificate(s) + 3 copies
* Household file folder
   * Rental agreement(s) + 2 copies
   * Utility agreement(s) + 2 copies
   * Deposit(s) + 2 copies (either for rental or for utilities)
* Employment file folder
   * Employment contract(s) + 2 copies
   * Recommendation letter(s) + 2 copies

That is the rough outline.  The problem is the file folders are quite big and take up a lot of space (since they are bigger than A4/letter to make it easy to put in and out).  I have seen some file folders with a whole bunch of divisions, but most of them are designed for school/business files - not long term personal document storage.

I would like to know what you guys think of the above organization strategy (all criticism and suggestions welcome) and if you have any suggestions for a good folder/organizer to match the above, please chime in."

I'm an HS student, so I have lots of papers from school/extracurriculars/past years. I've tried to wrangle it all into two bookshelves and two desktop organizers, but I find myself never touching most of it. 

This is my problem: I have too much stuff I think I'll use that I'll put away tidily and then never end up touching. I have a bunch of old projects that I don't want to see but that I can't bear to throw out. I have accessories that I hide away in the back of a bookshelf because I'm worried they'll distract me, but they end up taking up too much space. Trying to find a place for all this stuff gives me the paralysis, so I've not been able to keep my floor space clean for productivity. I spent an hour this morning trying to figure out how to remove all color from my desk organizers because I'm afraid of distractions...and didn't put a single thing away.

I realize my question may not be super clear, so I'll ask it like this: how do I get my room to a state where I only see the things I need, and not stay paralyzed all the time from sorting things I won't need?"

I have four drawers under my bed; one for shirts, one for pants, one for sweatshirts, and one for pj's. Here's where the problem starts, I have one of those cube organizers (picture attached) for my underwear, bras, two buckets for socks, one for like random tank tops and spandex, one for swimsuits, and another for random junk that I have collected which I will hopefully soon get rid of. Because these fabric storage buckets are so incredibly deep, I am having a difficult time trying to organize my underwear in there. I used to just throw it all in there and not even fold it but I really want to try and make them all visible to me or at least somewhat visible.

HOW TO ORGANIZE YOUR LAUNDRY ZONE,organizing,10,bcrlck,https://www.reddit.com/r/organizing/comments/bcrlck/how_to_organize_your_laundry_zone/,0,1555197829.0,"Here are a few handy organizing hacks to get your laundry smelling extra clean and fresh from the book Simple Laundry (which you can get for FREE [here](https://mailchi.mp/b2d39de65846/simplelaundryfreegift) for the next few days:)

Short on storage? Consider utilizing every wall space you can, such as the area above the laundry machines. If no storage solution is currently in place, you can install inexpensive cabinets or shelves over the washer and dryer to store laundry supplies. Group like items together in your cabinets so they are easier to reach and find. Laundry detergent, softener, stain removers, and other washing supplies can be arranged above the washer while dryer sheets or wool dryer balls can be placed above the dryer. 

You can also use containers to keep your laundry room tidy and organized. 

*Label them as follows:* 

¬∑ Money

¬∑ Lost and found

¬∑ Garbage

¬∑ Rags in different sizes

¬∑ Lost socks

If you don‚Äôt have enough space for a folding table, use your washer and dryer as one instead. 

Utilize vertical wall space. The narrow wall behind the door is often overlooked. You can easily hook a utility board there for extra storage. 

Over-the-door areas are great places for storage. Install an inexpensive door rack and arrange all your washing products on it. You can also attach a valet rod here for your wet clothes to dry on. 

Consider organizing your hampers horizontally for a more space-saving solution. You can arrange them this way with the help of a tall rack.

For an additional time-and-money saver, a handy trick I learned a few years ago is to use a magnetic dry erase marker. This little helper has saved some of my clothes from ruin. I keep the marker by my washing machine and write little notes on it about what‚Äôs currently inside or what cycle to run it on. Not only does this save you from time-wasting guesswork, but also saves money as you won‚Äôt accidentally run a load twice through the washer or dryer."

I hate laundry. Right now we have 3 small bedrooms and one baby. One room is the closet for hubby and me, the baby gets her own room, and the third is where we sleep. I love the closet in a separate room, our bedroom is always neat since we really only sleep and bang in there. I dry all of our clothes in the closet room and easily transfer them to drawers in two steps, all of the hanging clothes dry right on the hangers. Now with the baby I hate that her clothes are in a separate room  since I have to carry hers over (first world problem I know!) and can only put away when she's not sleeping. So often her clothes just sit in a basket while ours get put away.

We are hoping to have 2 more kids and build a new house. I think a large family closet/ laundry room would work better. The washer and dryer and sink  would be in the same room. Lots of space for everyone's clothes/ drying. When they are older and need more privacy I can possibly Curtain off areas for them?

If I build this room all of the bedrooms would be smaller with no closets. I'm thinking bed with a desk and side table. 

Has anyone tried this before? Would love to hear your thoughts, ideas, pros, cons."

Edited to add: there are usually only about 20 invoices max at one time in the holding tray. These are service invoices that the techs have tried to reach the customer to service, and we're waiting on the call back 
Anyone have any ideas? "
Just moved to a home without storage! - HELP,organizing,5,9soprb,https://www.reddit.com/r/organizing/comments/9soprb/just_moved_to_a_home_without_storage_help/,4,1540940463.0,"I‚Äôll try to keep this short, but I‚Äôm not very good at that!

TL;DR New place is 2x as big with less than 1/4 of storage. I decluttered, but I don‚Äôt have anywhere to unpack the boxes to. Meanwhile we keep digging in the boxes for what we need. 

We just moved to our first owned home from a teeny 1 bedroom apartment. I thought it would be easy to expand into the space, but instead I have boxes against walls. 

The apartment had a bedroom closet, a 10ft long hallway closet, bathroom linen closet and a ton of kitchen cabinets. 
The house I moved into has 2 bedrooms, one master closet that is 90% water softener, 3 upper and 3 lower kitchen cabinets, and that‚Äôs it! No garage and no basement (crawlspace). 

We have pantry items stored in clear totes under the breakfast bar type counter. My husband‚Äôs tool chest is in the corner of our bedroom and none of my crafts have anywhere at all to go (crafts like sewing machine and fabric for our quilted curtains I‚Äôm making.) The counter keeps filling up with stuff that we use and don‚Äôt get put back in the moving boxes. I can‚Äôt cook a meal without getting frustrated, even if I clean as I go.

I decluttered more than I should‚Äôve already. 
The second bedroom is my baby‚Äôs.
Everything that has a space is already put away. 
We plan to remodel, but that‚Äôs hard to do in a cluttered house. 

All that considered, I still am looking for sanity right now. I work from home to be available to care for my child and it‚Äôs so distracting and stressful to see this crap everywhere all day long. 

Does anyone have any ideas on where to start? I‚Äôm willing to buy temporary storage solutions even if it‚Äôs not permanent. Also happy to read articles, but I‚Äôm struggling to find ones that aren‚Äôt saying to declutter more. I‚Äôve always wanted to get fully organized, but I lost a lot of progress when we moved. 

Thanks in advance!"

I'm new here, and I hope this question is OK.

I have a box full of photos - they're old photos that belonged to my dad's aunt, all of people that I don't know and have no way of finding out who they are. There isn't anyone who might want this box (I'm an only child and so was my dad. My grandma didn't have any other children, and neither did my dad's aunt)

I had all the pictures scanned and burned to a CD (they're also in Google Drive). Is it OK to throw away the actual box with the pictures?"

I‚Äôm here to ask for help with a big problem I‚Äôm having. My mom passed away last year, and it‚Äôs up to me (just me) to clean it up, figure out what to give away and what to keep, etc. Her house is sort of an homage to my childhood, and it‚Äôs incredibly difficult letting go those items as well as my mom‚Äôs possessions, which feel like pieces of her. I‚Äôm a strong person and a hard worker, but my childhood was stressful and difficult, so I really feel like that‚Äôs compounding my irrational attachment to these objects (it even has made it difficult for me to get rid of my own objects that honestly aren‚Äôt that important and don‚Äôt mean that much to me). Trying to get rid of most of these things just seems to arouse some sort of panic/guilt/overwhelming sadness in me. 

At this point, I‚Äôm thinking of hiring a professional organizer so that I can stop drowning in my depressive/anxious paralysis in the midst of all these things I can‚Äôt muster the resolve to be decisive about, but if possible, I would rather save the money of course.

Does anyone have some advice on what I can do about this? I would really appreciate any of your words of wisdom on this; I‚Äôm really struggling. Thanks so much in advance. "

Do they really save that much space? It just seems like it compresses things, which I would imagine is great for things like pillows but less so for clothes.

Cel mai probabil, angajatii acestor companii au treburile lor zilnice la birou, obiectivele lor, proiectele lor, care trebuie intrerupte pentru a-si concentra atentia pe organizarea evenimentului. Un eveniment corporate, are nevoie de o atentie speciala. Are nevoie de un buget, de un program, de furnizori de servicii, de un ambient potrivit temei, de un plan pentru situatii neasteptate si de oameni bine coordonati. Informatia este foarte usor de accesat in vremurile noastre, iar internetul va poate face cunostinta cu wedding planneri din diferite locatii, va poate da acces la un minim portofoliu al acestora si va poate lamuri macar in linii mari in ce masura va poate ajuta fiecare.
Evenimentele corporate se impart in doua categorii. Prima e cea in care se sarbatoreste un moment cu importanta si simbolistica pentru companie, si in aceasta categorie avem: petreceri aniversare, petreceri deschidere de sediu sau de final de an, ori petrecerile cocktail. Iar cea de-a doua categorie de evenimente corporate este una mai restransa si are la baza un scop bine stabilit, destinat unor obiective de natura profesionala sau umanitara: gala pentru strangere de fonduri, congrese, simpozioane. Pentru congrese si simpozioane necesitatea este mai mult decat evidenta. Educarea publicului, dezbaterea unor subiecte de interes sau prezentarea unor inovatii, sunt activitati menite sa ofere raspunsuri si provocari oamenilor din domeniu. Practic o necesitate.

In cazul in care veti intra in mediul online, veti avea ocazia de a gasi informatii complete in acest sens. Insa, inainte de a lua in calcul colaborarea cu o firma din acest domeniu, este foarte important sa va asigurati de faptul ca serviciile nu vor lasa de dorit in ceea ce priveste calitatea lor. Odata ce veti face acest lucru, atunci veti fi cu siguranta multumiti de tot ceea ce veti primi. Organizarea unui eveniment poate deveni o sarcina destul de stresanta, mai ales daca ne gandim la toate detaliile pe care va trebui sa le aveti in vedere. In aceste conditii, lucrurile sunt destul de simple, deoarece pentru a va bucura de evenimente reusite din toate punctele de vedere, tot ceea ce trebuie sa faceti este sa va asigurati de faptul ca veti selecta o companie specializata in vederea colaborarii.

Beneficiile serviciilor de event planning
Un organizator de nunta sau wedding planner, cum i se mai spune, are principala misiune de va indruma, de a va pune intrebarile potrivite la momentele potrivite si de a va descoperi pe voi ca persoane si ca miri.Consilier personal. Participa impreuna cu voi la toate alegerile pe care urmeaza sa le faceti, cauta si vine mereu cu idei, variante si recomandari pentru ca toate sa fie exact pe gustul vostru. Uneori poate face chiar lucruri in locul vostru, daca nu stiti, nu aveti chef sau timp sa le faceti. De exemplu sa negocieze contracte cu alti furnizori sau sa caute locatii potrivite pentru stilul vostru. Acest rol al organizatorului se intinde din ziua in care ati semnat contractul cu el pana in ziua nuntii. Supravegheaza si coordoneaza toti furnizorii contractati pentru a se asigura ca totul decurge conform planului. In cazul in care apar situatii neprevazute, gaseste solutii. Acest tip de organizator participa la nunta ta si o coordoneaza.

Pentru evenimente reusite optati pentru serviciile de calitate
In functie de natura evenimentului organizarea poate sa includa: elaborarea unei teme sau concept al evenimentului, stabilirea decorului si a elementelor de entertainment, coordonarea completa cu locatia aleasa si serviciile oferite de catre aceasta (electricitate si alte utilitati), aranjamentele de decor, mese, scaune, echipe de suport si securitate, catering, elemente de signalistica, parcare, curatenie.Organizatorul de evenimente trebuie sa defineasca apoi locatia, activitatile de entertainment, lista invitatilor, vorbitorii si continutul detaliat al evenimentului. Locatiile pentru evenimente sunt nenumarate si diverse si de regula acestea sunt reprezentate de hoteluri, centre de conferinte, sali de receptie sau spatii exterioare in functie de eveniment. Un organizator de evenimente trebuie sa fie capabil de a-si gestiona in mod inteligent timpul alocat pentru organizare si sa creeze evenimente memorabile.

Este cel mai bun sprijin in cazul nuntilor cu un mare numar de invitati, care sunt de cele mai multe ori greu de gestionat de cineva care organizeaza o nunta pentru prima data in viata. Astfel vei evita ca o organizare nepotrivita sa duca la nemultumiri printre invitati sau calitate slaba a serviciilor contractate, nemultumiri care se reflecta in mod vizibil si pe camera de filmat. Orice serviciu care nu e prestat sau orice produs care nu e livrat la cea mai buna calitate posibila, va duce la o nunta cu imperfectiuni. Iar un film al unei nunti cu imperfectiuni nu poate fi perfect, oricat de priceput ar fi videograful, oricat de buna camera de filmat si oricat de ingenioasa editarea. Ca sa poti beneficia din plin de serviciile unui wedding planner trebuie, in primul rand, sa fii dispusa sa fii ajutata. Nu poti consilia pe cineva care nu doreste sa fie consiliat. Trebuie sa ii acorzi increderea deplina, sa crezi ca recomandarile pe care ti le face sunt pertinente si potrivite.

In my bedroom have another 200+ with medicine, receipts, electrical, etc. Another few hundred in my closet, in bathroom, in pantry etc.

I could label each box with a sharpie, but it's really tough to put my finger on something in a hurry when I need it.

I could put a sticker on each box with a number: 1,2,3,4 etc - and then document it in a spreadsheet by alpha. But lets say I have 1-100 in bedroom, 101-200 in garage, and then I have 5 more i want to add to bedroom. 

or let's say next year I want to move 30 into the closet etc. 

Anyone know of an efficient way to catalog an endless number of still growing boxes?

Also... sign up when thinking about ordering something... go ahead and put it in your cart, give them that same email.

And no I am not technology incompetent or new to devices, I am a crazy busy full time grad student, part time pet sitter, part time consultant for 2 direct sales businesses that are basically just for fun extra cash... My problem is is that I end up putting notes in my notepad in my phone, when I'm on the go or just laying in bed and can't sleep so that I can remember them in the morning, I carry around a purse with a planner and a bunch of other stuff I don't really need.. I carry my wallet but am really interested in figuring out how to house all my stuff safely in my phone and eliminate carrying a bunch of stuff I don't need.. I have an iPhone 6S and a MacBook Air that I know have a million features and things I'm not fully utilizing but would really love to figure it all out. I just don't have the time to do that by reading a crap ton of reviews on recommended apps and trying to set up 800 different accounts.

I want to figure out ways to:
1) keep all my calendar dates and assignments organized and run out of 1 place instead of being jotted on pieces of random paper, in my calendar, or in my phone so that I have to look in 3-4 places to remember things.

2) note taking- both for classes and my regular daily jottings -- has anyone ever used the Wacon Bamboo pen? Or bamboo spark? I love handwriting school notes and calendar events but I have issues ever returning to those writings unless it is to type it into the computer.

3) help me to set goals and maintain them... I.e. Getting things accomplished that need to be done by certain deadlines

4) any way to help reduce the amount of spam and somehow transfer only the accounts you care about all to one new email address so that you can delete the old one or just be able to get your email address off of all the mailing lists?

Essentially I am just looking for ways to completely get my life run and organized out of my iPhone and my MacBook and not having everything scattered!

I'd also like to be able to have a way to see when the jobs are scheduled for and when the parts are scheduled to arrive. I know I'm probably over-complicating things but I want to make sure I can stay on top of all the jobs at the same time.
Thanks for any and all help."

Need advice on how to get the most functionality out of my new closet space?,organizing,3,3yxu5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/organizing/comments/3yxu5y/need_advice_on_how_to_get_the_most_functionality/,1,1451616728.0,"So my husband and I just moved into a new apartment, and are in the process of installing shelves, hooks, etc to make the best use of our closet space.  Some helpful info.  We live in a major city, with no garage, basement, attic, or other storage outside of our apartment.  So that means making the most out of every inch of closet space we can.  We have figured out the hall closets and the front closet, but the bedroom and bathroom closets we can't come up with a good plan.  Any advice on how to make the best use of this space would be appreciated.  

The bedroom closets are oddly square and a little deeper but not big enough as a walk in closet.  So the two bedroom closets are identical and are 42"" deep by 43"" wide, by 110"" tall.  There is currently a clothing bar installed at around 62"" from the floor and a 15"" deep shelf above it at around 64-65"" from the floor.  There is approximately 9"" of wall/moulding on either side of the door at the front of the closet, the door measures about 24"" wide. One of the closets would be used by my husband and I, the other would be a kids room closet for baby/young kids.  We are open to moving/removing the shelf and bar that are installed, and I expect to need to purchase at least one free standing PAX closet from Ikea for additional storage.  

The bathroom closet used to be a stall shower that was changed into an open closet. That measures 31.5"" wide by 35"" deep, by 79.5"" tall.  There are currently two 15"" deep shelves installed at 30 and 60"" from the floor.  We are open to removing the shelves in this closet as well.  We aren't sure if we would put a door on this closet or put up a curtain or just leave it open.  

After we finish the plans for each closet and get things properly put away we will probably consider adding door mounted organizers inside closet doors as needed, so any recommendations for ones that work well would be appreciated.

Introducing the Advice Point and User Flair System,Advice,365,bjke3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/bjke3q/introducing_the_advice_point_and_user_flair_system/,100,1556762910.0,"## **Officially launched Open Beta. Feedback appreciated! Please comment your thoughts below.**

See the TL;DR stickied comment for a summary. 

---

Hello advice givers! **We are proud to announce that we are currently testing out a new system.** You will be able to earn points for providing advice, and earn flair levels too. 

Right now, we think that on average, threads do not receive enough helpful advice. There is no incentive to be helpful! Many people ask for advice every day, and a lot of these requests go unnoticed or ignored. We also think that thread creators don't respond enough. We want to encourage both for a more vibrant and robust community. 

**So, we are introducing our Advice Point system!** 


---

## **How it works**

Whenever OP submits a thread, the automoderator will provide a comment with instructions. Long story short, if OP responds to a comment with the word ""helped"" in any way, the commenter will receive an **Advice Point.**

Your Advice Point score can be seen on your user flair. This is a little title that's next to your name. The more points you get, the cooler your title. Here's a list of what we have so far. 

**TLDR: If you are OP, please respond to comments with the word ""Helped"". If you are a commenter, don't do anything different, just remind OP to respond with that specific word if they find your comment helpful.**

Point Requirement | Title 
---|---
1 Point | Helper
5 Points | Unlicensed Counselor
10 Points | Expert Advice Giver
20 Points | Master Advice Giver
40 Points |  Phenomenal Advice Giver
60 Points | Advice Guru
100 Points | Advice Oracle
150 Points | Enlightened Advice Sage
200 Points | Assistant Elder Sage
300 Points | Elder Sage 

---

## **So what's the point of this?**

Well, nothing really. But we have found that people generally like to be helpful. We want to give recognition to the people who have helped our community. These people deserve to be commended and praised for their help, and this is how we want to do it. 

There is no monetary benefit, and having a higher rank title doesn't make your advice any more important than anyone else's. However, it will show the history of your helpfulness. 


---

## **Helpful tips**

- Only OP can award points. If you are not OP, and you use the word ""helped"" in your comment, automod will let you know that no points will be awarded.
- OP can award 1 point per person per thread. 
- OP can award 1 point to *multiple* people in the thread. All advice is helpful and if OP got helped by everyone, that's fantastic!

---

## **We will test this system out for a minimum of one month, to give users a chance to chime in and provide their opinions.** 

Please be patient with us, as this will be an Open Beta test, **you may experience minor bugs or issues**. Please feel free to let us know if anything goes wrong. If people are not happy with this system, we will remove it and return things to normal. 

Finally, feel free to include any suggestions or thoughts below. Happy advice-giving!"
Throwaway because‚Ä¶ well because‚Ä¶.,Advice,266,dij1aw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dij1aw/throwaway_because_well_because/,37,1571223349.0," 

I was raped.

I (mid 30s male) was raped when I was 12 years old, by my older male cousin. He took me to the attic to show me playboys, and then insisted we ‚Äúpractice‚Äù. He penetrated me.

I‚Äôve been increasingly suffering anxiety around sex. I dont know why it is manifesting only now after so many years. I feel the walls close in on me, my heart races to the point it hurts, I tremble and break out in cold sweats. 

It has taken me 20 years to tell someone. I told my wife today, who I have known for 15 years, dated for 10, and have been married for the last 5. When I told her, I still couldn‚Äôt show emotion, I couldn‚Äôt feel emotion, and only once she hugged me and then took our daughter to take a bath did I break down crying.

I dont know what to do. I dont know who to talk to. I am a strong, beardly, tattoo‚Äôd man. I know my outward appearance shouldn‚Äôt effect how I deal with this‚Ä¶. But the stigma around being a male victim of rape is‚Ä¶ daunting.

I think I am finally ready to talk to someone. But I dont know who. Who is qualified to deal with this? What type of therapist? Shrink? Psychiatrist? Psychologist?

Sincerest apologies if this is not the thread for this kind of advice. 

Thank you"
Parents opened my mail and tried taking one of my paychecks,Advice,153,dihg0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dihg0t/parents_opened_my_mail_and_tried_taking_one_of_my/,27,1571215587.0,"Hey just looking for simple advice on this matter, mostly just how to bring up how fucked up this is to my parents.

Long story short I go to college and am on a tuition payment plan. My parents usually pay my tuition but this semester decided they wouldn‚Äôt be able to and I would need to pay it my self. The tuition is paid in 3 installments, first one they paid, second one I was supposed to get my own loan for, third one I pay out of pocket. I had let them know I wouldn‚Äôt be able to secure my own loan with the low amount of credit I have, they pretty much just told me figure it out. Now 2 weeks after it‚Äôs due I obviously still can‚Äôt pay it and my dad is down my neck about it. 

Well my job messed up one of my direct deposits and had to send a check to me by mail. Problem is they sent it to my parents address but I live by my college now. I had told them my paycheck is coming in the mail and I would be picking it up. 

Today I get a text from my mom stating the paycheck came in but she opened it thinking it was something else (obvious lie), and that they will be keeping the check and putting it towards the tuition payment and I would have to pay them the rest of the tuition. 

I have already cancelled the check and had my job send out a new one to my current address. I haven‚Äôt responded to them yet but I‚Äôm just trying to figure out the best way to go about telling them that no matter the situation that‚Äôs an incredibly fucked up thing to do. I have other bills and shit I need to pay for so they can‚Äôt decide to take money that I‚Äôve worked for, especially when I don‚Äôt even live with them anymore.

Just note they‚Äôre obviously more on the strict and hard headed side otherwise I would have already said something. But I‚Äôm honestly at the point where I don‚Äôt even care anymore. I‚Äôm 21 and don‚Äôt live with them, if I have to graduate later because I can‚Äôt pay tuition for now I don‚Äôt mind it. 

Tl;dr my parents opened my mail and took of my paychecks that was sent to their house by mistake because I can‚Äôt afford to pay tuition right now."
Single Dad Stuck in a Vicious Cycle,Advice,754,di6393,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/di6393/single_dad_stuck_in_a_vicious_cycle/,173,1571164955.0,"Quick recap: fell for a girl.  Got her pregnant.  We got married.  Had another child.  But the whole time I was catching her sexting, calling guys for hours while I worked, saying she loves them, it started online on this thing called IMVU until she banged my friend in real life which is when I moved out.  

I kept forgiving her because my dream was the to be a husband and father.   Until it broke me.  Literally broke me.  The last 6 months living with her, all.i did was lay in bed.  Sleep.  Became a potato.   

When I finally moved out, she moved a dude in from.another state she never met in person, only met in imvu, and this full out destroyed me mentally. 

ANYWAYS. I'm now 29, going on 5 years of being single. Rebuilt my life.   But I still feel this thing in my brain.

I feel like I still have no personality after this happened.  I used to be fun and witty and now I'm more serious and quiet and am alone every chance I get.  

I've tried dating. But usually one of us ends up ghosting the other.   I justify not dating by thinking, Do you really want to have to add an adult human in your life? The drama.  The baggage.  Nahh.  Just be single and read books all day.   

I just, have nothing to say anymore.  I dont like to go.on dates because I'm in my head so much.  My head is always thinking about deep stuff.  But I never have anything to say.   

Me on dating sites is - hey, hows life? That's cool.  

Me in dates ""small talk small talk silence"" 

I just dont get it. Before kids.  I could even date anyone I wanted.  People loved me.  But now.  I cant even have good conversations.  

So I end up never going on dates.   Instead I end up finding someone  who is also broken, we get our emotional fix for a couple months until we mutually ghost each other.  And usually it's a situation where we cant see each other.  (The amount of times a girl has said she wants to get tickets to fly out to me is astounding) 

The whole situation with my ex broke my brain.  And it coming up on 5 years, is finally getting to me.  

What can I do? How can I get out of my head? How do I get a personality back? Is this who I am now? The quiet deep thinker who doesnt go out? Am.i destined for just these short online interactions for my love life? 

Anyone have this happen and escaped? Or is this just who I am now?

Welp.  Let's see how my first reddit post goes.

EDIT: maybe my wording sucks.  But I'm over what happened.  And am not sad.  Or anything.  It's more of a, I lack personality, or at least compared to what I used to have.  I suck at conversing.  I'm the guy who can sit quietly staring into nature for hours.  Without saying much of anything.  If that makes sense."

But, this weekend she confided in me that she's thinking of transferring to the boyfriend's college but she's worried, among other things, about what her mom has instilled in her. She's really struggling with this concept (i.e., she doesn't want to look or feel foolish if she transfers, they get married eventually, and then divorced--like we did--or things don't work out for whatever reason, 'cause life . . . right?).

While we are very close to each other, I've never told her why I divorced her mom. The reason, by the way, is because she had not one, but two extramarital affairs. It was 15+ years ago. One was before my daughter was born, and another was afterwards. I had no choice but to divorce her, obviously. I feel as though, if I tell my daughter the actual circumstances, she'll see perhaps that our situation was (I hope) unique to us and she's not destined for the same thing.

Should I reveal or just keep on truck'n without saying anything?"

First of all my mom has schizophrenia, and she doesn't take her medication, because of this she is extremely violent towards me. She abused me physically... But now I'm almost 17 and she's almost 60 and she can't really hit me for obvious reasons, but she does abuse me mentally... I can't study, I can't be with my friends, I can't anything... She doesn't even let me go to school, because she says I'm gonna die if I go (completely crazyness). She puts loud music, screams and abuses me verbally, says my girlfriend and friends are horrible, calls my gf a whore, etc...

Recently I called the cops (I live in Portugal btw) cuz I wanted to go away from her, DEFINITELY. What happened was the worse outcome, first they couldn't do this right away, which is understandable, it takes weeks even to process. The important thing is, they gave me 3 options, thus the metaphor to choose from torture devices:

Option 1: Stay with my mom and suffer till 18
Option 2: Go to a ""child support home"" (idk how they call it in English)
Option 3: Police will go there every time she has to take the medication ad make her take it

1 & 2 Seem pretty neat right? No! Let me carefully explain each one

Option 2: they told me those building are 90% children who are unstable and violent... That's why they put them there, they basically said the reality of it, and that I WOULD get beaten up every day there...

Option 3: the health delegate would come to my house and see my mom is rly schizophrenic, then they force her to take the medication... So my neighbors know the situation cuz they listen and see it sometimes, and they already called the police... She just pretended she was fine and she didn't get anything, it will be the same this time...

So I've been made to pick between being fucked up in school cuz I can't study or, sometimes I can't even run away from her to go to school, cuz sometimes she doesn't let me (option 1 & 3) or getting fucked phisically, quite literally.

There is option 4: someone else take my custody and It would be my new home, but no friends of mine's parents will do that... I talked with them... What should I do? What can I pick? I'm desperate and out of options..."

The participants in a cheering type of competition at my university used The Holocaust as a theme. It feels so wrong to me but other people here thought it was cool. How do I get it across to them that this was wrong?,Advice,2,diku60,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/diku60/the_participants_in_a_cheering_type_of/,2,1571233275.0,"Is this even the right sub to post this? It just happened around an hour ago.

Background: There is an annual cheering event at my school. The university is divided into academic organizations based on their courses and these compete against each other. They are allowed to have themes and costumes and the goal is to make catchy chants with choreography while throwing jabs at each other and praising your own theme. People take it seriously. The people joining are freshmen, so around 17-18 years old.

This year the students all unanimously decided to remove the insult portion of the chants and instead turn the whole event into a platform for bring awareness to social issues. Which is good because our country right now (Philippines) is under a lot of shit and people are restless. My university in particular hosts a lot of rallies and is general more liberal.

What happened was one of the competing teams showed up dressed as concentration camp prisoners. They wore bald caps, over sized ragged shirts, chains and make up was used to depict them as starving and pale. They carried a sign that said ""Concentration Camp"". The cheer leaders were dressed in military uniforms and gas masks. In the end they were gassed and the ""prisoners"" died.

I wasn't even able to understand what social issue they were trying to portray because the Holocaust imagery was really disturbing. But the crowd seemed to love it because they were clearly applauding.

Am I missing something here? They really paid attention to details so I doubt they didn't know what they were doing. The consensus as of now is that these kinds of presentations should be disturbing and should make the audience uncomfortable, but did they really need to mock a tragedy like that to get the shock value?

I'm afraid I can't articulate my words properly when I talk to other people about this."

But my most recent issue is my debilitating anxiety and depression. Though they're not new by any means, but they have gotten extremely worse. I've not left the house in 3 years, including for work and we( me and my boyfriend)also spray painted the house windows black.  I feel trapped. Trapped in this house, even though it's all in my head.  What started this for me is the fact that my boyfriends whole family and friends all live directly surrounding us. Dont get me wrong his family are great people and all, and they would constantly try to buy me things or take me places or just invite me over for some food. And that lead me to start feeling guilty, and that's on me too. I have mommy issues, I dont need a therapist to tell me it's the stem of all my problems. she never cared about me or did a God damn thing to help me so I cant let anyone else do that either because I feel undeserving. Dad ditched when I was born too. Anyways. Having it being my boyfriends family adds more pressure for me instead of just some random strangers because I can just tell myself I dont know them. They really do mean well, but I cant put a toe outside of the door without them trying to approach me or talk to me, or even just with them pulling into our block, there's a pothole so they always drive reeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaal slow and it damn near gives me a heart attack. our house is at the opening so there really is no peace for me. Am I alone in this? I mean sure maybe it wouldnt effect you the way it does me, but is that relaxing to anyone?? Not having a moment to yourself unless you just lock yourself up in the house?? I feel like a dog on a shock collar and every time I see one of his family members, it's going off and teaching me not to go out past that point. 

Another huge issue right now is the lack of activity I'm getting. I used to be pretty fit and super active, my diet was never great though.  It's not that I wouldnt eat my vegetables, it's that I would eat everything and all of it. I never had any self control and my mother would call me a human garbage disposal. It's crazy though because looking back at my old photos I was like damn, If i just ate a little less I could have had abs.  Flash forward to now, I eat way less than I used to, only for budget reasons, still have no control. Only difference is I can control what I'm buying now and it's all almost completely plant based. Except my boyfriend likes to bring home pizza and taco bell way too often. I've gained probably 40 lbs and extremely insecure about it. My boyfriend doesn't mind at all and is still extremely attracted to me, and I know that's all that should matter but nine times out of ten it leads to me screaming at him when he tries to touch me, lifts my shirt up, or walks in while I'm changing. I really dont mean to do it, it's a reaction and I hate that it spooks me so badly. I just feel vulnerable and exposed. 
Okay, last bit. Yesterday, for the first time in a long f-ing time, I decide to sit out on the porch with my cats and coffee. Not even all the way out, still sitting in the doorway in a feeble attempt to keep myself out of view from any passer bys. And ofcourse my boyfriends two female friends pull in that lives on the other side of us, they decide to stop their car to stare at me and then proceed to text my boyfriend, ""yo girl got fat what happened""

So I don't even know what I'm asking for at this point. I do try to work out, but I never make it more than a month consistently and that's the current record since I've moved in here 3 years ago. We want to move out of this neighborhood but my boyfriend can't afford it without me working. I am also depressed and even my hygiene is lacking. If I didnt live with my boyfriend i dont think I would shower.

 So, I don't know what to do, I dont know where to start, but it would have to be small and baby steps. If anyone read this whole scatter brained cluster fuck, I'm sorry."

A girl ( F Grade 12 idk her age probably 17) added me (16 Grade 11) off quick add on snapchat in August. We didnt know each other prior. We talk on snap alot and she goes to the school that's a 10 minute walk from mine. I tell her about my life and struggles and she does the same, you know, casual shit. She has a thing with someone but never mentions it. She's cute and kind so it's all cool to me and being friends is all good.

(She just snapped me as I'm typing this.) So I occasionally go to her school at lunch because I have homies there. I took a snap of the school, sent it to her, and she's like ""whoa you're here?"". I said yes and all that but we never ran into each other. Later that day, I took a step to ask her if she wanted fo meet up that Friday and she said yes. The next day (it was Thursday), she ghosts me ENTIRELY. No snap, no contact no nothing. It lasts till about the following Tuesday.

I didn't think much of it till I got hit with the surprise that I was transferring to that school mid year. I got there and all my friends freaked out cause I hadn't told them I was coming. 

That was two weeks ago.

Up till today, I still haven't talked to her in real life even after asking to hang out during lunch which the response I got was ""I can't"" or ""I'm busy"". Very vague shit right? 

And this is coming from the same woman who I sent a snap to saying ""Sorry for my ugliness"" and she replied back with ""No you're ok why do you think I send the pictures I do to you. And she's RIGHT! She really does send really appealing photos to my phone!

Anyways, I've seen her around the school but I'm starting to think that:

A) She has cripling anxiety and doesnt think we will click irl or feels she's being fake online and cant make up for it in person.

B) Her now boyfriend who goes to another school might find out and break up with her. I have no idea if he's abusive.

C)  She just wants my attention online but doesn't have my time in person.

But I think I've made it more obvious) who I think is bi-curious. They only had a same-sex relationship online and not in real life. Anyway, they recently went to talk to somebody about their church and went to confession. They revealed that they were ‚Äúbi-sexual‚Äù and had a relationship online. I don‚Äôt remember exactly what they told me, but I remember that they said the priest asked them if they were okay to kiss the same sex in real life. Which my friend said that they were afflicted/disturbed by the thought of it. They never really considered having a relationship with a person of the same gender in real life. So they felt confused. After telling me this, they told me that they were going to force themselves to be ‚Äústraight‚Äù so they could be accepted, pure, or something like that. At the time, I was about to tell them that they might just be bi-curious, but after hearing them saying they were going to force themselves to be a heterosexual stopped me. 

Are they bi and attracted to the same sex, but not **physically**?

Are they straight and just **curious** about the other gender?

Are they actually full-on bi, but just **stopping** themselves from **accepting** it because of their religion/what people say about it?

All I could say was that they‚Äôre still that same person, and no matter what they will still be loved. I‚Äôm very conflicted about this, and I don‚Äôt know what to tell them. On one hand, I want to say that they might be just bi-curious and that's all. But on the other, a small part of me wants to say that they should just test it out.

This might be off-topic but, they also say secretly depressing things. Like how they just want to ""die right now"", how they ""don't want to exist"", or how ""they could barely smile that day."" I don't know if this is just from our generation's (gen z) dark humor, and the internet just influenced it, or she's dropping hints about how they are feeling. But just in case, I want to know how to keep them going. It's ~~pRobAbLy~~ because I feel like this, and I don't want her to go through what I felt.

Always stressed, thinking they were a waste of space, bringing everybody down, disappointing people, I don't want them to feel like that. Because it hurts. ~~(lmao tearing up like a little baby.)~~

It frustrates me because on social media the ‚Äúfriend‚Äù flaunts that he‚Äôs this fabulous father who loves his family, yet clearly he isn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know his friend personally, nor do I know his wife, but I feel compelled to tell her. I feel all people deserve honest, loving, respectful relationships. My Bf told me he has tried to tell his friend it was wrong, but his friend did it anyway. 

When I told my Bf I wanted to tell the wife of the cheater the truth, Bf got upset Bc he says I‚Äôm going to ruin their marriage. I said it was already ruined Bc his friend was cheating on her anyway. It can only get worse, or someone else would tell her eventually she would find out. ‚ÄúThe truth always gets out.‚Äù Mainly I wanted to tell the wife Bc if I were in that situation I would hate to continue being with a cheater and would be grateful for someone to tell me the truth, even if it were a stranger telling me. Of course I would be wary Bc I can‚Äôt provide specific details, like with whom he cheated with, but I hope that would open the dialogue. I felt if the cheater and his wife really want to work it out they could see a marriage counselor and he could get help, rather than sweeping his actions under the rug and avoiding any sort of consequence. Or he could continue to lie, but these are all hypotheticals....

I‚Äôd like to know 1) Is it wrong for my Bf to be mad? He insists it‚Äôs not Bc of the bro code that he doesn‚Äôt want the wife to know, but because he doesn‚Äôt want the family to split up. He insists I‚Äôll be the one to ruin their marriage if I tell the wife the truth (it‚Äôs already ruined though?). 

Also, obviously I think it‚Äôs the right thing to tell the wife but Bf also made the comment ‚Äúit‚Äôs none of my business poking my nose in their marriage‚Äù. Reddit fam, What do you guys think?

But, he's not that tragic.

He's also tried to molest his six year old little sister.

Two weeks ago I went and applied for a job in my community. I ended up getting the job, and received the acceptance letter today. In order to get me into training, they need to validate my identity and run background checks on me. I filled out the form giving them consent to check me this morning.

When I checked all the reports they had my name, and some other random persons name below mine. I was like what the fuck??? So on every report, it says 

*Primary name*: LickinNosr

*Alias (AKA)*: This fat bastard using my SSN

I get to the results of the report and it says my SSN trace failed because they were unable to validate my identity.

I profusely apologized the first time, promising it will never happen again, until a month later I forgot.. again.

The family of course wasn't happy the first time, and the second time was just a week ago and I just received an email telling me I wouldn't have to come anymore. 

I curled up in my bed the first time I did it, and the second time I did the same, having to be convinced to go to dinner that I was planning to go before. Now that I've received the email I feel even worse, and I don't know what to make of it as guilt is really a first thing for me. It's the first time I've made someone lose respect for me with the fault being 100% of my own. I enjoyed tutoring but I couldn't redeem myself.

On a side note, I always held myself to a high standard and integrity and the people I've encountered seemed to appreciate it, but recently I've been bombarded with tasks, family problems, administration problems and they're really a toll. Right now I'm not being the person I wanted to be and my then-high confidence is dwindling fast. 

It's obvious that not everyone would like you or be forgiving and it's also obvious that you can't always not slip up but as I'm experiencing it first hand I really do not know what to make of it or what to move on. I find myself being rash, always wanting to go to bed to avoid responsibilities, wanting to be alone (in daily life and in prospect), although to be fair these thoughts aren't just because of this incident. 

Friends have told me it's ultimately not a big deal, and I want to believe them, but I can't convince myself to. Would someone be kind as to dissect what I'm going through and help me do something about it? It's deserved, of course, I don't even have the excuse of ""I tried everything I could"", because I clearly didn't. But I received this email minutes ago and it mentally froze me and I can't do anything. I have this pitiful look on my face and I hate it. I don't have it in me to go ""That was a harsh lesson but I can learn from it"" or something of the sort. I can't manage to assess if I'm exaggerating or downplaying my deserved guilt and my thoughts are all over the place.

Thank you.."

I'm talking full blown screaming paired with scratching and the thuds of the dog ramming it's entire body weight into the door for hours on end. I asked the owners what to do and they informed me it was normal and to just ignore it or put her in the garage. They told me she does this when she gets attached to someone. The owners are an older couple who are hard of hearing so I guess it's not really and issue for them, but it's impossible for me to ignore the sounds even if she is in the garage. I could even hear her through earplugs.  I was told she has to sleep in the laundry room, otherwise she will pee everywhere, but the owners also suggested that I sleep with her in the living room so she would have company . I tried this last night and while I was sleeping she climbed onto the couch and peed on me and all over the carpets in the living room. She doesn't seem to respond to any form of discipline either.

THAT HE WAS ‚ÄúKINA‚Äù (yes. ‚Äúkina. not even ‚Äúkinda‚Äù. like he‚Äôs illiterate or something) TALKING TO SOMEONE ELSE. like, what the fuck?? it‚Äôs so obvious that he doesn‚Äôt like me and never did, so why even give me his number?? was it because he felt pressured by my friends? honestly, he could‚Äôve easily said no and that would‚Äôve made me feel a thousand times better, because now, i thought i had a chance with him that was never there. or maybe, there was a chance there and i just fucked it up? like, did i overdo the texts .. was he never into me .. or what??? idk but the sad part is that i still think that maybe it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs too afraid to come out, and that maybe it‚Äôll all work out one day, but truthfully, that just seems unrealistic to me and i think the chances are astronomical, therefore it won‚Äôt be happening ever. i need advice (duh). i‚Äôm not sure what kind. maybe even just your thoughts/opinions, or maybe just advice on how to get over the only guy that‚Äôs ever made me feel valid.  anything will be greatly appreciated. thanks"

But my parents have shown zero interest in getting to know him. They've only spent time with him during major events like the holidays or my college graduation, and the few times I've brought this up to my mom.... Nothing happens. 

My mom started a new job about a year ago, and it causes her a lot of stress. She also hates having people over because she thinks the house looks messy; this in turn probably due to her being stressed she doesn't have the energy to clean as often. And recently, kind of told me she was unavailable for a couple months due to having to run a special election. 

I feel like I keep making excuses for her and my dad. I don't think I'm the outlier - when I look at my other three siblings, they are/have been the ones getting plans in motion for significant others to hang with them. And I don't know if I have an unrealistic expectation since my boyfriend's parents are ALWAYS inviting us to get togethers. 

I'm not even sure what advice I'm looking for? - How to get my parents to take this situation seriously? Am I overthinking the situation? I plan to marry this man and them not expressing any interest, especially when they live only an hour away, kills me. Thanks for any helpful thoughts."

On Tuesday I met up with another friend (M) after dinner I had w/ my best friend(F) and one of her friends (F).

Some back story: I know this friend (M) through my best friend. At dinner she was not in a talkative mood at all and kept her headphones in and in the car ride room where I dropped her and her friend. 

I met this other friend (M) for about 20 mins ? And went home. 

She has blocked me on everything. I contacted (M) to ask what was up, and he said my best friend is angry at me for not telling her that I saw him for 20 mins.

I was going to tell her through convo the next time I saw her anyways, WASNT like I was hiding everything. However I don‚Äôt understand what I did that was SO bad that I got blocked ??? 

Im very confused. Am I missing something here pls be honest. We are in our early 20‚Äôs , this is very childish behaviour to me"

My parents split up two years ago, but they technically aren‚Äôt divorced yet because my dad refuses to pay for it. I had been living with my dad on one side of the state and my mom and brother moved to the other. When they moved out, my mom left me with one of her cats because I love that cat. 
So I had been living with my dad for a while but he got a girlfriend who is a whiny, over sensitive bitch and she has three bratty kids. My dad started being very mean to me and his girlfriend hated me. The three kids were awful and violent and loud. It got to the point of verbal and mental abuse. They‚Äôd tell me that they hated me and wished I‚Äôd just go away. The kids would hit me and steal my stuff and I was forced to do all of the housework and not allowed to ever leave the house except for school. I got screamed out for the smallest things and my ‚Äústep siblings‚Äù would eat all the food so I often went hungry.
Over the summer, I told my dad I was visiting my mom, and just never went back. I moved in with my mom and got enrolled in my brother‚Äôs school. The only things I had with me were the things I brought with me to visit.
I was forced to leave my cat behind initially. I planned to go back and get her and the rest of my belongings when everything calmed down, but every time I tried to get my stuff my dad wouldn‚Äôt let me. He doesn‚Äôt even like my cat but he won‚Äôt give her to me so he can threaten me with her. Every time I piss him off he says stuff like ‚ÄúDo you really want to piss me off when I have your cat?‚Äù  He‚Äôs holding her hostage and using her to get me to do what he wants because he‚Äôs mad I left. My grandma tried to reason with him and get my cat and my stuff but he won‚Äôt listen. 
I haven‚Äôt seen my baby in three months and I‚Äôm so scared for her. My dad has had animal abuse charges pressed against him and I‚Äôm terrified he is going to hurt, sell or throw out my cat. I care about that cat more than almost anything and if she gets hurt I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll do. If I were to call the cops would they be able to make him give us the cat?

Something is wrong here,Advice,1,dikyx7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dikyx7/something_is_wrong_here/,1,1571234085.0,"My apologies if the title is a bit out of context, the situation itself is... bizarre.

Ok, so a little backstory. My wife, son and I moved from the East coast of the USA to the West Coast just last month. Hard times have seemed to plague our family through 2017-2018 as is an occurrence for most in life and this is our fresh start, a chance for new opportunities in life. I honestly love it out here and do not miss it back home. The road trip was beautiful and the spare time we've had to see the sights have been amazing, but one thing stands in the way for me and it's starting to take a toll on my mind... my wife and son haven't caught on and I honestly want to keep it that way for now.

So we've entered into a transitional housing program as our finances were limited due to the circumstances before we started our trip from coast to coast. I had set up our appointments to get into an apartment here weeks in advance to ensure we had a smooth transition and a roof over our head when we arrived at our destination. Over the phone and online, the environment here came off as accepting, understanding and very friendly. This was the case when we arrived as well, it's nice and everyone here is welcoming and inviting. Except one, the head of the program, we'll call him ""B"". B oversees everything that is done around the property. I have had limited interactions with B but they were just like everyone else, always asking how the day is going, greets you anytime you pass by and asks if you need anything on a routine basis. Normal enough right? Well, fast forward two weeks in and everything is going as well as can be. Or so I thought.

So my wife returns home from her shift at work only to find out that her keycard to access the building had de-magnetized as the cards are very sensitive and seemed to react to the magnetic nametag she wears with her uniform. The way the building had been constructed was in a typical hotel style where all the units are accessed solely from the inside. I was busy with my son at the time and hadn't heard my phone ringing as she was going to have me come downstairs to open the door. When she'd finally gotten back up to our apartment, about 10-15 minutes of waiting around, she'd told me B let her back in. She told me that he had been a complete asshole about it, which pissed me off and I contemplated going to look for him but decided against it. Basically, B had come from around the backside of the building while on maintenance duty and found her out front. When she explained the situation, he argued that she should have waited at the side entrance as the front door was for employees only and the side entrance was residents only. Well... we both knew this anyway and she'd come up to the front since there was no one in sight at the side door and residents are not allowed to open the door for anyone outside in the first place. B basically rambled on about it like a parent and just wouldn't let it go, leaving another staff member to overhear the conversation and intervene to divert B's attention from pushing the matter any further and so they could get the keycard re-activated.

After a while, we forgot about it all together and continued about our day as we chalked it up to B simply having a bad day. All of a sudden though, from that day on, B just avoids us altogether. What's strange is that B will act just as he was when we first arrived to all the other residents, that friendly, bubbly personality. We thought maybe B just has a problem with people who don't follow rules to the exact T and we just stopped giving a fuck about him honestly, things happen and I felt his expectations of residents to be unrealistic at times. Until he started a renovation project in the apartment right across the hall from us. This is where things really take a sharp turn, for seemingly no reason at all, it just doesn't make sense. So here it goes...

It was a Friday afternoon when B started the project as new residents were expected to move in the following Monday. It was your typical project, getting new appliances, new locks, new materials for the bathroom and all that good stuff. In and out, in and out and B wouldn't so much as speak a word in our direction or make any eye contact whatsoever. Whatever, until the evening comes around. About 9pm is when everyone and everything is quiet so B will do what he can to finish up for the day without making much noise and disturbing the surrounding families. I was browsing Youtube around 10pm when I hear a tap at the door... odd I thought. I walked over to our front door and checked the peephole. Nothing. Weird but I thought nothing of it really, as some kids were typically still awake this late on weekends and were probably just screwing around. At 1030pm I was in the middle of checking emails when I heard a distinct tap at the door this time and I know someone had to be there. I checked the peephole again and nothing. I could see B was still across the way, packing up for the night. I saw his cart filled back up with tools and material sitting by the door but he was nowhere in sight. Maybe B hit the shitter. I had decided to head to bed after that as we had an early start the next day for a trip to explore the town on our day off and forgot about it.

Saturday afternoon was quite relaxing, everyone was in bed early after a long day in town and I was back on the laptop doing my thing when this time, around 9pm again, I heard someone at the door. It wasn't the typical tapping from the previous night, more like someone was pulling at the door handle to come in. ""What the fuck?"" I thought as I crept over to the peephole. B was again across the way, working on the apartment. I had a clear view inside the apartment across the way and didn't see B anywhere, just his cart. No noise, nothing. I was a bit put off at this point and ruled out any of the kids as being the culprit, it was just too quiet. I closed my laptop, threw on my jacket and quietly slipped into the hallway to make my way to the balcony where I could have a smoke. While I did, I kept my eyes peeled for the person fucking around in the hallway. I waited to no avail only to see B return to continue his work and he hadn't gone near our door. I decided to have another smoke in the hopes that if I waited long enough, I would see someone come to our door as I can see it from the balcony. Still nothing. It was too cold to sit outside any longer and I returned inside to my apartment. Around 11pm I was finally ready to call it a night. I decided I would check the peephole one more time just to be safe. B was just now leaving the apartment as I looked out and as he was pushing his cart out to leave, he stopped, eyed our door for what felt like an unnerving amount of time and he had no idea I was looking out from the other side. He then sharply turned away, wheeling his cart with him as if he knew that someone was watching. ""Fucking creepy"" I mumbled as I walked to bed. I avoided telling my wife the next day as not to cause any discomfort for her.  

Finally, Sunday night arrives and I continue my routine. Everyone is in bed and here I am, wondering what the fuck is next? I felt it had to be B, but why? What's the purpose? Tonight was the last night before the new residents moved in and B's last night working on it and there seemed to be little left for him to do, I figured he'd be out of there early tonight. All the meanwhile I had been contemplating a camera but there is no way to post one discreetly enough as we are not allowed to install them anyway. All I had was a peephole and my ability to get to the door quick enough if anything else happened. At first, I had planned to just ignore it, it wasn't worth it, until around midnight when I heard the lock on the door actually fucking click. When the lock clicks, it's because a keycard was swiped. The only reason I didn't immediately grab a kitchen knife and prepare to stick someone was that the lock lit up red upon the keycard being swiped. I knew it wasn't one of our keycards due to the fact both of ours is where we left them earlier this afternoon. For just a moment I thought maybe a new resident got mixed up on which unit was theirs, crazy but it happens and thankfully they couldn't get in anyway. All of a sudden I froze, I heard a male voice mutter ""Fuck it."" That voice, was B. Even with the limited interactions, I knew it was him, his voice is very distinctive. It took all my willpower not to open that door and stick him. I slipped over to the peephole and found him walking to the stairwell, no cart in sight, no tools, nothing. The apartment across the way dark and the door shut... I didn't sleep at all that night, for obvious reasons.

A week later and I still have not come out to anyone at the complex about this, not even my wife. I have been thinking it over constantly, as B is the director and I fear retaliation and losing our housing if I put him on the chopping block. Strangely enough, I found out that B is on ""vacation"" as I have not seen him lately and the timing is too suspicious as he took off after that night. I do not know when B will return but I felt that I need to do something before that happens, but what? The situation could leave us on the street as I have not saved enough to free ourselves from depending on this program just yet. I would need a couple of more months. I will update as things go on but what are your suggestions?"

I'll keep it as short as I can. I'm doing my master's degree abroad and there's another American in my group. Clean cut kid, very; very quiet and polite.

Lately he's become more and more quiet, participating in class less often (though the program is cell/molecular bio focused and he was a psych major, so maybe he's scared to ask questions?)

Anyways, he didn't show up to class today and didn't respond to anyone's messages. Our program is small so the group chat blew up with texts asking if anyone knew where he was or had gotten a hold of him. My first thought was the loneliness of being in a new country and not being in a program you're suited to (I majored in it and this stuff is tough) might drive someone to suicide. Idk. He finally answered his phone and people were pissed but then relieved. I think everyone else was thinking the same thing.

I've known three guys who've killed themselves and I told myself I will do anything to prevent a 4th. Idk, something just seems off about him. I try to say hi as much as possible and talk with him outside of class but he's always been hard to talk to. Almost avoidant."

I (F, 28) work in a very male dominated environment - basically the only female on a male team.

It's a casual environment and I'm very good friends with the guys there. In particular with someone named Doug

So Doug is a buddy of mine and last month while I had a pony tail he decided to come and lightly smack my head. I said uhh wth?? And just casually laughed it off.

Fast forward to a few days ago, Doug comes by and smacks the top of my head again!

This time I was Stern and said to stop doing that, it's not funny. He got serious, apologized, said he wouldn't do it ever again, and we moved on.

Now - why is this bothering me the more I think about it?

Doug is a friendly guy who everyone loves, he's a great coworker and friend, and he obviously didn't do it with the intention of harm. I wouldn't go to hr for this (but if this was someone else I 110% would).

I told him to stop and not do that again, but for some reason I still feel like I need to talk to him about it.

I'm not sure why it bothers me .. is it because my boyfriend has and will never do that to me? I have anxiety and history growing up with an alcoholic father - is that what triggered it?

It seems like I have been getting these symptoms about one minute before I have to use the restroom. Not while on the toilet but just regularly out and about. I am age 30 and never had thiS 160 LB 5'8. I hope its just IBS related to Anxiety and Stress as I have been having panic attacks lately. I had a CT abdomen scan in January of this year and everything was ok per doctor. I went in for Frequent urination at that time but that is about the only baseline I have. No blood or anything else that is a sign.** 

""People with IBS frequently suffer from anxiety and depression, which can worsen symptoms. That‚Äôs because the colon is in part controlled by the nervous system, which responds to stress. Evidence also suggests that the immune system, also responding to stress, plays a role. IBS can also make you feel more anxious and depressed."""

How To Stop Being Toxic?,Advice,1,dikl9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dikl9e/how_to_stop_being_toxic/,3,1571231777.0,"I'm a female, 23yo. I feel like in my entire life I'm very toxic. At first I didn't notice it but since my ex bf told me that I am suffocating, I realize that I actually am. At some point, I didn't really care since I felt like I'm always alone anyway. Now I found some nice people that I would call friends (online, i dont really have any irl friends) and I start being toxic again. I wanted to talk to them a lot (my ex told me that he got no time for others because of me and he didnt wanna spend time with me) but I know I shouldn't. I like talking a lot, even if it's about nothing much but what I do today etc. A lot of the time tho, it went to negative feelings that I talked about and then felt bad about it later on. I felt like I put too much stress to people I talk to.

Long time ago, I kept everything to myself and I was scared to talk about all my feelings but I've changed since then and I realize that I quite enjoy talking about it (via text). It wasn't exactly good for me (maybe) but I think it's better for people around me. Lately I've been thinking about it a lot, how toxic I am and I'd rather be back to how I was before than suffocating people around me. I appreciate them being around for me, I don't deserve any of this kindness towards me especially that I am very toxic but I also want to keep them around since they are here already. I like having people around me as a friend. I like having friends. I wonder if I'm being selfish to want to keep them but they can leave me whenever they want to, and they know that. I won't text them first, so if they don't want to text me ever again, all they need to do is to stop texting me and I'll be gone.

My main issue would be keeping my problems to myself. I don't wanna talk about it, I don't wanna even hint about it to anyone. Any advice on how to do it? It happened before but idk how to trigger the fear of talking again."

College class is structured poorly,Advice,1,dikjkp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dikjkp/college_class_is_structured_poorly/,9,1571231498.0,"We are learning this software called GIS.  The format of the class is as follows:
You are assigned a set of exercises each week.  You do readings that teach you about concepts that are involved in the exercises, but not directly how to do them.  The reading is extremely dense, and hard to retain, but it is clear.

The class is just 30 minutes of lecture purely on definitions and terms per week (2 two hour classes per week), and the rest is lab hours to work on the exercises (with instructor present.)

My problem with the course is they expect you to learn basically everything from the book, but don't teach any of it in class besides definitions that have little to do with the actual homework.  The teacher is just there in case you need help.  When I inevitably ask for a lot of help, the teacher seems to become frustrated.

To me it seems like the class is set up lazily by the instructor, when he should be actually showing us how to use the program.  I would guess most people learn better by demonstration as opposed to only reading a book.

Am I crazy or does this class seem to be poorly structured?"

A basic run down is it‚Äôs supposed to be a college/life preparation class. It covers things like what occupation would you like to have after high school, or at what age would you like to be married and how many kids are you planning to have? Personally I think it‚Äôs nobodies business what I do after High School and overall I think it‚Äôs a useless class which is the general consensus with my peers and the majority of my school‚Äôs teachers and staff so the class will likely be discontinued in a few years. Also It‚Äôs absolutely miserable in the class because none of my friends are in it with me right now and most of the people in the class are people I don‚Äôt want to associate with, so most of the time I just do my work and just start reading a book when I‚Äôm done (which is the majority of the class period.)  However after a few controversies I had with the teacher he now has a personal vendetta against me and is failing all my work no matter what I do. This is very easy for him to do because they work we‚Äôre assigned has no real guidelines or right answers so he basically decided whether or not he likes our answers. One thing I did that ticked him off is that for ‚Äúmy lifestyle surveys‚Äù I closed the most minimal life style possible and set it up so it could be easily supported by minimum wage. I thought this was okay, but a week later he would tell me to change some thing like ‚Äúoh you can‚Äôt but 50 dollars as your monthly clothes budget, it must at least be 150.‚Äù And ‚Äúyour rent money is too low!‚Äù(the reason why he thought it was low was because I live in an area where the rent is too damn high. When I tried to explain to him I don‚Äôt plan on staying in this state an plan on moving somewhere else he just wouldn‚Äôt hear it. So I did change the stuff, but then once again a week later he told me to change more things right before the deadline.(which I quickly completed.) But that didn‚Äôt stop him from giving me an F anyways, on another one of the useless surveys we had to take I was kind of in a bored mood so I answered the survey like I was a mafioso(which I know is something you shouldn‚Äôt do for a serious assignment but he never read the other surveys anyways so I didn‚Äôt think it would matter[also it was ungraded anyways.]) Well, after the Teacher started getting ticked off at me he decided great a week after I had already turned in the survey(which was online) he would actually read it. On one part I put for something I would like to do in my work environment or whatever I wrote ‚ÄúWhacking People‚Äù which at the time I thought was funny especially when my Teacher started to lecture me on why ‚Äúkilling people is bad‚Äù I was just like ‚Äúwhat are you talking about, whacking doesn‚Äôt mean killing people. I mean, people get whacked all the time. Kids get whacked when the piss off their parents and college kids get whacked with batons all the time.‚Äù He did not like my sense of humor and decided to report me to the counselor‚Äôs office. But that didn‚Äôt go anywhere because I didn‚Äôt actually break any rules and it was clear that I was just joking.  

Okay now I know I have been rambling, and yes I know  I haven‚Äôt been taking the class very seriously especially a few weeks ago. But now I‚Äôm in a situation where even if I do my very best and try not to make any jokes or anything like that my Teacher will still fail the assignment and claim it didn‚Äôt meet the requirements when it most certainly did. Now I would normally be fine with failing this class because I‚Äôm not learning anything and I don‚Äôt even think it gives you any credits. However if I don‚Äôt pass it I‚Äôll have to retake it next semester and if I don‚Äôt pass it again no matter how good my grades are in my other classes I‚Äôll have to repeat my grade!

I‚Äôm dealing with a lot of crap here, and I don‚Äôt really know where else to turn for advice by now.  The short version is that my (M16) long distance gf (F15) has so much going wrong in her life that she‚Äôs desperate to die. She‚Äôs mentally ill and not wanting to get help, and I‚Äôm unable to get in touch with people who can help her. 

I met a girl some months ago online. We only planned on being friends, but it sprouted into a relationship. Since then I‚Äôve found her to be absolutely incredible in just about every way, and I want her in my life more than anyone. 

She had a very bad home life. I helped her escape it, but she had an array of issues because of what she went through. She has an eating disorder, seems to have something like borderline personality disorder, and might even be schizophrenic. She experiences severe hallucinations (auditory, visual, and tactile).  She‚Äôs also constantly bullied and attacked at school. She‚Äôs stuck in the foster system and at this point, I‚Äôm the only person in her life that she actually cares about. Because of all of this stuff though, she is very suicidal. It‚Äôs getting worse by the day. 

The problem is that she has been careful not to give me her address or the phone numbers of people like her foster family, because she knows I‚Äôll do something to help her. I have nothing more than a full name and a very large city. This means that, so far as I know, the only way I can help her is by convincing her to seek help. Unfortunately, she‚Äôs very resistant to it. She‚Äôs scared that she won‚Äôt have the option of suicide, she won‚Äôt be able to self harm, they‚Äôll make her eat properly, and she‚Äôll be treated like she‚Äôs crazy. And that probably is what would happen if she sought help. 

So I have no idea what to do. She‚Äôs been the only light in my life in years and I can‚Äôt lose her, but I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs anything else I can do. She‚Äôs desperate for a way out and I don‚Äôt know what more I can do to stop her. There‚Äôs no immediate danger at the time of posting this, but I don‚Äôt wanna wait until then. Anything y‚Äôall can do to help is appreciated. I know it‚Äôs a heavy topic, but I‚Äôm desperate."

And I would definitely like to say that I am not seeking legal advice. Just moral help on how to deal with a locally owned business employer.

My employers refused to schedule me due to a moderate to severe stutter. After my friends and family pushing me, and my bosses telling me they would schedule me when I was ""better I ended up contacting a lawyer who put me through to another lawyer that does non profit work for people in a situation like me.  The lawyer that was given my case was fantastic. I got a different job since then and its actually much better than my previous job. The lawyer and I decided to keep pursuing the case though because they can't get away with the discrimination.

Anyways my employers were given a deadline to pay me for wages in would have gotten if I was still being scheduled at least my regular hours. The deadline was Monday. I spoke with my lawyer this morning and she said my 1 boss called her, basically telling my lawyer that she is sorry this happened, I've know my one boss for 14 years as I am friends with her son. She also said that they don't have the money. 

Now I've got a few options. I could continue to pursue the case and let it go to the civil rights commission. That will take 6 to 9 months and end up causing my employer to pay even more to pay the group my lawyer is with so they can continue to do what they do, also my lawyer said that at that point she recommends that we go for emotional damages and medical costs as well. Up to this point we just asked for reimbursement for what I should have been working. 

My 2nd option is lower the amount we are asking. As bad as it sounds I'd like to avoid this because the amount we asked for would be just enough to get a $1000 used car since my car is going to pieces. 

A 3rd option my mom and I thought up was that they pay half now and half in about 6 months. My lawyer likes that we are willing to do this but worries my employer may just refuse to pay the other half.

It was 5 years ago, after I finished pre-med, I was reviewing and doing practice questions for Mcat and GRE and preparing to apply to medical school and PA school as plan B. I was confident and passionate young man. At the time, I loved reading. I tutored my classmates during premed, killed every classes, and crushing every other competitors. I was confidence that, at least I would get accepted to PA school, if not medical school because my resume and recommending letters is stunning and appealing in my measures. However, series of events happened in short period of time that knocked me off my course. My whole entire world, my mom got accepted to ER. She was confused and she was nut. She freaked me out and imprinted that events deep in my memory. After that she has to take a bunch of medications, her supportive of me going to medical school changes, her behavior kinds of change, and it seems she won‚Äôt make it until I graduate from PA school or medical school, which is my goal to pay her back for the nurturing and raising me. 

During that time, I worked in a kitchen at a restaurant. The working condition was a shit hole. Everyone‚Äôs yelling at everyone else any chance they can get or out of nowhere, it more like a zoo, and as a young men, I didn‚Äôt know any better. I was shocked of how a human can be that low and terrible to each other, as I was raise as a catholic and my mom always told me that human are good and I did believe her up until that period. I ended up quitting that job and on top of it, the hatred of my mom who I loved so much build up. I hated her for how come she lied to me and not teaching me a practical knowledges that I can use in life, I hated her for tell me to let it go and not letting me punched the shit out of the guy that I work with in the restaurant and also hated myself for listening to her. Many thing built up that threw me into major depression. The signs and symptoms are classic textbooks descriptions that I read during premed. I was isolated my self, avoided social interaction, done nothing but go to work and come home to my apartment by myself, and sleep alone. It felt dreadfully lonely. I thought of dark thoughts many time and even think of doing it, but before the depression, I have 2 principles that under no circumstances that should be violated. 

1- never hurt others

2- and hurt yourself. 

After whole years of being useless and suffering, one of the promising treatment for depression is social support. So I pushed myself out there despite whatever my heart may feel or hurt, I pushed my self to talk and make friend with people again. During this self treatment, I found out that paramedic takes much shorter time to complete. So I applied, got accepted, and finished the program and working for 1 years at an emergency service now. Back to present, I got accepted to higher education for healthcare career, which is more challenging then EMT and Paramedic school. It need focus, read a lot more, and memorize much more, and I still have not much support from my family. I couldn‚Äôt get my self to sit down to read as long as I used to be. I lost my edge and it frustrates me that I‚Äôm not good as I used to be, I‚Äôm losing it to other competitors, and the feelings are sucks.

So for medical profession and other highly competitive fields, how do you get your shit together after a major set back? After a betray of your love one that now distracted you and fragmented your mental health?

Thank you."

Last year, I was approached about taking over the host position upon Josh‚Äôs retirement.

Everything seemed great, but things started going downhill when Josh‚Äôs contract can up for renegotiation...

Our Big Boss decided not to fully renew Josh‚Äôs contract (mostly because J is a dick) and instead granted a one year extension until a final decision was made on a replacement host. This was when Josh‚Äôs behavior became erratic. Right after getting the news about his contract, Josh came straight to my office to tell me how there was no viable option for a new host in his eyes and how he wouldn‚Äôt go down without a fight.

It first started with Josh cutting me off when I would talk on air - he‚Äôd just interrupt constantly or try to rush me with non verbal cues. I should add that our producer is very timid and is often bullied by Josh through constant insults and demands. Basically, he‚Äôll cave under pressure, giving Josh whatever he wants. Next thing I know, my planned special segment projects were dropped wayyyyy back on the filming timeline and I was being cut out of special live events (I.e. live shows with audiences, meet and greets, etc.). In fact, Josh actually stole one of my ideas for a special saying ‚ÄúI should do this one so I can justify my job, you have plenty of other great ideas.‚Äù This has been a huge kick in the stomach given the time I‚Äôve invested in this project (over a year).

My question is, how do I overcome Josh‚Äôs ability to censor me from our audience and bosses? Do I avoid him and guard all my ideas? In my mind this a double edged sword since It could signify a lack of creativity on my part. I just need to make a decision one way or another... to leave, to stay, or to call Josh out on his BS. 

Anyway, I apologize for the novel and appreciate your feedback."

Baby momma drama,Advice,1,dik83j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dik83j/baby_momma_drama/,1,1571229626.0,"I always liked those people that called in on the radio when I was listening to particular programs where they would say, ""long time listener, first time caller"".  In this sense I'm a long time lurker, first time poster.  I'm finding myself in a bit of a conundrum that I have yet to be able to find a solution to and decided to reach out for other opinions that differ from mine and my inner circle.  I hope this is the appropriate group to post in, forgive my ignorance if it's not.  Let's get down to brass tax here:

Just to give some context, two years and some change ago, I moved back to my ""hometown"" after living in another state in order to help my family out in a pinch, and when I came back I wasn't in the best place mentally.  I ended up meeting and dating a woman off and on for the following two years.  Looking back, we should have become friends instead of lovers. I have never been one to be successful in relationships due to plenty of factors, but for whatever the reason I continued in my attempt to make this one work. 

Early on in our relationship she revealed to me that she has been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder.  I spent months researching it and really attempted to learn how to separate the person from the diagnosis.  There would be weeks where it was truly pure bliss and I questioned why I never fully committed myself to this person yet something would always come up in her life that caught me off guard and didn't seem to make logical sense (i.e constant car wrecks, two suicide attempts, various hospital visits, getting fired from high paying jobs because she was ""too depressed"" to go to work) .  I wanted to but never fully gave myself to her because of the fact that I would find out or catch her lying about multiple things. 

On paper she is everything I wanted in a person.  She is the most talented, beautiful, strong minded, capable person I have ever known.  But emotionally  I couldn't deal with everything that was happening in her life.  I was dealing with a plethora of my own issues.  Sometimes I would ""ghost"" her solely for the fact that I needed some mental breaks. There would be times where I started to feel crazy, where I just needed space.  She has a son and things like giving him Melatonin so he would go to sleep, or keeping him out late at night on a consistent basis (we pursue hobbies that go late into the evening) would just break my heart.

She is now pregnant.  She told me it was mine, but the two ultrasounds she showed me don't seem to make sense.  The first one she said the end of her menstrual cycle was a week prior from what it showed on the ultrasound (she said she has the paperwork to prove it, but she won't show it to me), the timing doesn't seem to make sense, but there is a legitimate chance the baby is mine.  She told me in prior conversations that she is considered a high risk pregnancy, that she is throwing up blood, her uterus is detached and the doctors she has gone to put her on bed rest.  Then when I ask her what hospital she has been going to in case I don't hear from her she's told me she doesn't remember.  She has recently been fired from her most current job because of being put on bed rest, yet I find out she is still continuing to get involved in things we pursue that someone in her situation shouldn't be doing.

 She has over the years accused me of physical abuse, emotional abuse, rape (twice, and then recounted it to multiple people) and even though she backtracked and apologized for those things, I constantly have been the one that tried to patch things up and get to a mutual understanding that potentially we could work out as a couple.   It just never happened. We kept in contact after she told me she was pregnant for a multitude of weeks after determining it would be mutually beneficial to get a paternity test due to the fact that there were others involved between our ""breakups"" then suddenly a few months ago she stopped answering my calls or texts.  I don't want to get involved in a relationship with her again and I am exhausted by the drama, but I don't want the next 20ish years to be unnecessarily ridden with conflict and drama. I have done everything from reach out via phone/text, message her parents, leave groceries for her and her son, mow her lawn, yet she continues to tell mutual contacts of ours that I'm not trying to be involved, that I'm not reaching out, that I want nothing to do with this child but it can't be further from the truth.  I want you all that realize that I am not a Saint and I have done some questionable things as well, but I'm looking for answers here.

&#x200B;

How should I continue to approach this?  As a man.  As a potential father?  Should I keep fighting this fight?  I just wish we could talk like adults.  Am I fighting the BPD or the person?  Should I just wait out the next couple months?

r/advice.  If anyone has been in my shoes before, or even if you have an opinion reach out to me.  I am going bonkers here and I can't keep showing up at her house because it's making me feel kinda creepy.  Thanks for letting me ramble"

So I dated this guy for two years and he was my first love. We literally had our lives planned out. But he cheated on me. For 6 months with a girl I worked with at the time. He repeatedly lied about what happened and I‚Äôm still not sure if I have the whole story, but after I found out about it, he never lied to me again. He was loyal and honest with me after that. We stayed together for 7 more months until I decided I couldn‚Äôt be with him anymore. The pain from his cheating wasn‚Äôt going away and I felt like our relationship wasn‚Äôt fun anymore. I started talking to one of our mutual friends who I always talked to when things were bad with me and my boyfriend. Eventually we started dating and we‚Äôve been together almost 2 months. Sometimes he can be rude to my friends and other people we work with but not to me. He does things my ex never did and I know for a fact he wouldn‚Äôt cheat on me because he was cheated on multiple times so he knows that pain. He always tells me my ex never treated me right and he just wants to love me the way I deserve but sometimes he can be overly sexual and push me to do things I don‚Äôt really wanna do and makes me feel like there‚Äôs something wrong with me for not doing it. My best friend says she‚Äôs worried he just wants to get in my pants and I‚Äôm kinda worried about that too but I don‚Äôt think he would do that to me. Anyway, I just recently found out that my ex might be dropping out of college, doing drugs, and possibly joining the military and I can‚Äôt help but think it‚Äôs all my fault. I want to help him and I genuinely miss him. I miss being at his apartment and cuddling and hugging him. I miss him coming to see me on his lunch break. I miss watching our tv shows with him. I miss his smile and making him laugh so easily. My point is, both of these guys are really important to me. They always have been and I don‚Äôt want to hurt anyone, but I want to make the right decision for me and my life. If I‚Äôm not with either of them, I probably won‚Äôt be with anyone else. Getting to know someone else just sounds so exhausting and I don‚Äôt want that right now or maybe ever. Some people have called me desperate for not letting both of them go but I think both of them are great guys and I don‚Äôt want to hurt both of them. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôd be jumping right back into a relationship with my ex. A LOT of things would need to be worked out first. I just don‚Äôt want to cause unnecessary drama by bringing this up to anyone I know because some of them are biased one way and I need unbiased opinions. I‚Äôm just so tired of being torn between them. Can someone please help me? I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore."

i know the obvious answer is to end our arrangement before i end up getting more hurt but it makes me so sad to think about never talking to him again after talking everyday for almost 5 months. any advice is appreciated"

Soccer Moms are saying having a dog at a park is illegal. What should I do?,Advice,2,dihd90,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dihd90/soccer_moms_are_saying_having_a_dog_at_a_park_is/,7,1571215203.0,"[ HELPED! ]

Here‚Äôs background to this. My dog is a barker, he barks a ton when he‚Äôs scared, and he gets scared a lot. We‚Äôve had him since he was 10 weeks, and the entire year we‚Äôve had him, he‚Äôs never bitten anybody. 
This park is a shut down school with a giant field, and houses are all around it. People (including me) have used this park for our dogs for a long time. 
Recently, there‚Äôs been a lot of soccer kids here and said park. And my dog‚Äôs been getting scared and barking once in a while. 
So my dog was playing with his friend and running around on a patch of grass away from the fields, and the dogs ran into part of the field (that wasn‚Äôt in the way of the kids) once. Then when we got them back onto the patch, an older man walked by. My dog got very freaked out and barked at him. He events stopped barking, and the dogs were playing without barking for a while.
Then the soccer mom arrives. I expected her to ask us to put the leashes on, or something like that. But instead, she proceeds to tell us that DOGS ARE BANNED from the park/school grounds. Because some people didn‚Äôt pick up dog poop and now it‚Äôs a hazard. And their kids are ‚Äúscared‚Äù of the dogs. ( mostly puppies/ smaller dogs in the neighborhood)

So. What should I do about dogs being banned at the park? The soccer mom said all dogs in general, on and off leash.
Also, the park is the safest place for me to walk my dog without the risk of reckless and speeding sports parents.

P.S, these sports parents have caused a lot more problems. Blocking our parking spots, littering all over the field, etc."

However the problem is that he's kinda using me as almost his therapist? This involves telling everything that's bothering me, telling me about certain worrying thoughts he's had, getting me to stay up talking to him about things he's struggling with until 5 in the morning when I have an intense 9 hour uni day the morning after. 

And while I'm so happy I can help, I've got problems of my own that, while being not as bad as they used to be, still are quite difficult to deal with, and taking on a whole other persons issues will end up completely overwhelming me.

This has led me to try and encourage him to go to counseling numerous times, but he says he doesn't want to talk to someone he doesn't know, and that taking medication and going to counseling makes someone weak. (I've done/am doing both those things, which hes aware of) On top of that he says that he doesn't need it, and especially not if he has me. He doesn't seem to see that I really can't do this for him, plus I'm hardly qualified.

I just don't know what to do, I mean I've been struggling with mental health since I was around 13, so I kinda know what it's like to need someone to talk to about these things, but I also know the emotional weight that comes from carrying someone elses problems on top of your own. And I don't think I can manage it. 

Some people have said I just need to cut him off?? And not interact with him any longer? But I'm not sure how that would help him?

Unsure of which college to pick,Advice,1,dijxkj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dijxkj/unsure_of_which_college_to_pick/,7,1571227955.0,"I am currently a senior in high school and I am being recruited for my sport. I am in a promising position with two schools that are on both my ‚Äúacademic‚Äù college list and my ‚Äúrecruiting‚Äù college list (meaning I don‚Äôt just want to go to the school for the sport... I am interested in the school for their academics and want to use my sport to aid me in the admission process). 

Here is some background on the two schools:

Team A:
- highest-ranked sports team in the division
- great academics
- across the country 

Team B:
- terribly ranked in division
- great academics
- one state away 

I have to choose whether to move across the country to be on a good sports team or to stay closer to home and play for a team that is really lacking in their abilities.  I have been playing this sport since 8th grade and it‚Äôs a big part of my identity. I do not plan to play this sport after college but I am looking into coaching. If I rowed for Team B I do not think I would do the sport all 4 years because being on a bad team would be frustrating and (mentality-wise) not sustainable (in other words I hate losing). 

Also, I have a boyfriend who I have no intention of separating from. I am struggling with the influence it has on my decision. I don‚Äôt want to be far from him but I am also confident that we will be fine after 4 years and it will just be really hard.

I need to make a decision by November 1st when the Early Decision deadline closes but I cannot figure out what would be best for me. 

Which school would you pick in this situation and why?"

I'm not gonna lie it was really dumb of me, but at the time I didn't really care much about my social life, so I didn't get any of my friends numbers and didn't care to socialize at all while homeschooled because I was playing video games (I cringe at myself so hard). I am now in the 10th grade, and the school year already started for almost everyone and my Mom decided to send me to public school again (which I am very happy about, because it gives me an opportunity to socialize, however, I have not socialized with anybody out of my family for three years, so I have no clue how to go about socializing at all. Also, I would be the new kid, late to the school year and everybody else tends to already have their friend group.

"My ""friends""",Advice,13,di8fk5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/di8fk5/my_friends/,27,1571177349.0,"Hello, 

This is my first Reddit post. A little background- My Husband and I got married 2 Sundays ago and we have been together for 10 years. Through out these years I have had the same friend circle. Girls I have known since high school. I have gone above and beyond to be there for them every time they have ever needed me. Loosing sleep when they needed a ride or to talk, spending hundreds of dollars on plane ticket so they wouldn't have to drive 15 hours by themselves. Doing things for them they felt were difficult or overwhelming. Being there when they had personally sensitive and serious problems occurring involving their kids. Being a babysitter last minute. Last but not least, I have been to every single wedding and 99% of all birthday parties for them or their kids since we have known each other, I have made sure of it.

Well, despite sending invites out two months in advance- two of them said they couldn't make it because they couldn't get off of work. The one who meant the most said she and her husband would be there, they never called, texted, nothing. They just didn't show. It's been a little over a week and not a single one of them has congratulated us or (and I know how this sounds, but they all are big into social media) liked or commented on a single photo we posted from the wedding or our honeymoon. 

I'm deeply hurt. I want to give them a piece of my mind. I have reached out to them to make sure they are okay since I haven't heard from them, radio silence. My husband says to just drop them. Advice?

Summary: Got married- almost none of my friends showed. I'm pissed and hurt and not sure what to do or how to go about the situation."

Got my first job offer / buying a house,Advice,2,dih1ok,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dih1ok/got_my_first_job_offer_buying_a_house/,4,1571213642.0,"So this is a two part question.

First, i just got my first job offer. The money is decent and i think ill really like the company. Some background; i had internships in college but mostly worked in the service/hospitality industries so my professional experience is minimal. I was a business major with a marketing minor at a state school (my grandparents set up a trust so state schools were 100% paid for) so no student debt. I went straight to graduate school from undergrad (MA in marketing communications) so again, not a lot of professional experience but lots of schooling. Anywho, meeting with the company tomorrow to finalize everything after searching for a job for 3 months. Any tips for me starting out? I‚Äôm a generally chill, professional person so I‚Äôm not so concerned about my personality but more about moving from an education-based life to a full time job. It‚Äôs technically my first real job and I‚Äôm 25 and am feeling insecure about that.

Secondly, the same trust fund that helped me pay for undergrad got dispersed when I, the youngest cousin, turned 25. I have quite a bit of money from it and my boyfriend and I have been living together for a while but we‚Äôve been living in the apartment above my moms detached garage. It‚Äôs nice enough and there are two bedrooms so its spacious but its far away from both of our jobs (about an hour without traffic). We want to move closer since both of our jobs are in the same general area. I want to use the money from the trust dispersement on a down payment for a house. The monthly payment would be a little more than what we would pay for rent in the same area. He‚Äôs hesitant which i assumed was a macho thing about not being able to help with the downpayment much. We‚Äôve been dating on and off for six years and have known each other since middle school and know were going to get married. He‚Äôs also an electrician with construction background so i know that anything that happens to the house he could either fix or know someone who could fix it for cheaper than a non-industry worker. I know that he would pay back the amount of the down payment in fixes/additions to the house over the years. He says he doesn‚Äôt want to rush into anything but also agrees that if we can pay our own mortgage instead of someone else‚Äôs we should. I have enough saved/invested that we have enough for a down payment and plenty left over for an emergency/6 months if one of us lost our job, etc. just looking to see if others agree with me, or him, and why. Or if you‚Äôve bought a house what were the unexpected costs or any advice you would have.

Thanks in advance!"

Suicide is never the answer.

Have you ever attempted suicide but were unable to go through with it? Put the gun to your head and thought you didn't have the guts? It's not that you dont have guts, it's that your instincts and subconscious desires are stopping you. Your body has an innate need and desire to survive. 

If you manage to go against your body's will to survive, and manage to do it, it doesn't mean you stop the pain. You only pass the pain to family or friends. Push past the pain. Stand up and reach out. Your mind shouts to hide and that you're alone, but you scream back.

Tell your brain you know better. Get help. See a therapist. See a psychologist. Never take the end route without shoving with all your might. If your family is hiding you grab them. Drag them kicking and screaming into rehab if you have too.

You are not alone. Thousands and millions are shoving through life with depression, addiction and pain. Reach out to those like minded individuals and talk. Talk about your issues and your pain.

So I started a new job about a month back, and everything was all good int he beginning but now the real face of my boss is coming out. So it takes a little while for me to get used to doing things a new way. I'm an introvert and and overthinker! 

So things at my previous job was Avery very monotonous but my boss was the best!!! He was extremely motivating and encouraging. But here it's different. Like yesterday my boss asked me to call our stationary guys for some stuff, but his phone was busy when I called. So she tried calling him and he picked up and she told him stuff. When he finally delivered the stuff she said ""I had to call him once in 5 years yesterday, and see he already delivered the stuff"" I'm so sure that was meant for me cz I couldn't get such a small task done and she called him once and it's done. This really really demotivated me! 

These remarks keep coming, she puts in nicely and says them while smiling but I know they are snide remarks meant for me! Also she doesn't want me to change/improve anything the girl I replaced did, so technically I'm not even doing the job I was hired to do. 

Also I sometimes feel like I need to step out to take a break, this is a start up and I've never seen anyone take a breather to go outside which I find weird! 

I really really need help with how to just deal we this issue and not let her snide and passive aggressive remarks bother me! Please give me some pointers on how to handle this! 

TL;DR - my boss keeps passing snide passive aggressive remarks at me."

He‚Äôs a lot more of a narcissist and usually uses me, who isn‚Äôt really doing too good in life at the moment as the butt of every joke. He‚Äôs always talking about how perfect he is at all the things he does but then manages to make it sound humble and, while I don‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs a bad person, I just simply don‚Äôt feel like he‚Äôs a person I should be around at the moment until I get my life together. 
My big problem here however is two things, I have huge trouble doing this with anybody. One moment I‚Äôll be set on never speaking to a person ever again because they did something horrible and the next second I‚Äôm talking to them again because they said something slightly funny. This fact does not pair well with just how charismatic this friend of mine is, his personality just makes it so hard to separate from him. How can I get myself into the right mentality to actually go through with what I want to do and when I do it, how do I successfully maintain it? 
TL;DR How can I get out of a toxic friendship when the friend is way too charismatic and causes me to always want to go back to them?"

I have a YouTube channel with almost 2k subscribers, and with it I have a private discord server my fans can join.

I've been on a private friends discord server for a while with a few people that are important for this. Andrew is the owner of the server, CJ is Andrew's Cousin, Tyler is Andrew's friend, and AJ is CJ's friend. Travis is my friend, Dominic is my friend, and Liam is my friend.

Me and Andrew started arguing months ago. He would insult my hair, my body, my YouTube channel, my friends, etc. I basically told him to fuck off and that was that. We consistently argued for months. Skip to Sunday, I'm in a call with Dominic. We're talking about video games and he decides to go onto my discord server. He tells me that everyone except for Andrew, Tyler, and then moderators. I checked the log to see what happened, and saw that Andrew and Tyler had banned every single person from the server.

What.

The.

Hell.

I immediately call up Andrew and ask him what the fuck is wrong with him. This asshole just starts laughing after deleting every single person from my server. I tell him to get mental help and find something better to do. (Maybe not the right thing to say but I was really pissed.) It was 12 in the morning at this point so I didn't call Tyler. I just banned them both from the server, left the private discord server, re-invited everyone to the server, and called it a day.

Flash forward again, to a couple hours ago. Stuff had been going smoothly since then. Nothing bad had happened since Sunday. I'm working on a science project when I get a message from my friend Liam. (He's an admin on my discord server.) He tells me that two people are sending hentai and KKK propaganda in my discord server. I'm really confused so I go to the server and I see CJ and AJ spamming my server with what Liam mentioned. I ban both of them and delete their messages, thinking this was the end of it. It was not.

I see someone named eevee_lover in my discord server freaking out because people are sending bad things, so I explained that they're just raiding the server and that I had it dealt with. I get angry at them, and so I rejoin Minegang to ask Andrew if he knew what was going on. Guess what I see. I see eeve_lover saying that he's going to ""attack me from the inside"" like some shitty spy movie. It was Andrew ban eveading to harass me. He also created pikachu_lover. I confronted him and banned him

Should I try to become friends with this person (and how)?,Advice,1,dij7j2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dij7j2/should_i_try_to_become_friends_with_this_person/,7,1571224206.0,"I am a 4th year university student, and I would really like to be friends with a fellow classmate. We've taken multiple courses together, always sit next to each other, and always work on projects in pairs. We usually walk together and chat on our way to point B after class until our paths' split. We are both passionate and quite nerdy about our major, we don't tend to run out of things to talk about, and we have a really similar sense of humor. We have sort-of inside jokes (related to class only) and laugh often. I'm shy though, and so are they. They also seem anxious and like the type who doesn't really mind being on their own.

I'm hesitant to reach out for a few reasons. Firstly, what if they're totally content just having me as their fun classmate? There's not a lot of time before we graduate anyway, and we're both quite busy too, so they might see making a new friendship as a pain.  I don't want to ruin what little there is now, or make our classes together awkward, and a rejection would be quite crushing for me. 

The other thing is, **how do I communicate that I want to be their friend?** What would we do? I don't have a lot of friends, and the ones I do have I met in high school, so I'm clearly not good at befriending people. I also have the impression that they're like me in this regard. This classmate and I, we have similar interests, but they're all related to our major/books/movies/internet stuff. Meaning we're not both into anything that counts as an activity. So **if I were to try to become their friend, how would I go about doing that?**

I generally like most people, but it's quite rare for me to click with someone on the level that I click with this person. I'm so interested in getting to know them \~for real\~, but at the same time, I would really hate to make things weird.

I'm having some issues in my relationship because I'm pretty sure I have attachment issues. I meant therapy right now because when I was younger my grandpa molested me.

I've been doing a lot of research and I seems to be a fearful avoidant attachment issue. it means that I have fluctuating/confuse feelings of myself and of others. I'm comfortable with getting close to others but I also am leery of them and it's hard for me to completely open up and trust people in relationships. I also am very good at distancing myself from people if they give me reasons to not trust them.

Recently my boyfriend and I have been having some really big issues because of this. For example, I will be talking about something and he won't give me a proper response that I Dean as appropriate and then I get hung up on it and I can't let it go and I start picking fights with him for no reason other than I just want to have that feeling of security and knowing that he cares. Even though I know he cares I just need that enforce in that moment for whatever reason. I don't know what to do about this. I feel like I'm going crazy because when I look back and I tell the story it doesn't make sense why I responded the way I did. it was such a little thing and then it turned to the huge fight.

I live with my mom and sister who both just has part time jobs. My sister contributes next to nothing to the household and it‚Äôs hard to blame her with the state of things. She‚Äôs basically already moved out with her girlfriend, still has her stuff her and comes back a few days a week. We have no AC and live in Texas. Inside the house is absolutely nightmarish. 
She blows her money on either useless crap or food she sits on the couch and leaves to rot, and then she screams at my sister and I whenever confronted by it, blames the mess on us and completely shuts down. 

I‚Äôve had a really rough past. My father was terrifying. He‚Äôd molested me, threatened to kill us on several occasions and would get drunk and pick fights with my mom, He was fucking horrible. I thought she was someone I could trust‚Äîlike the only one in this world and that‚Äôs part of why it‚Äôs so difficult to leave this and leave her. But the longer my dad has been out of the picture, the more I see this nasty, manipulative, perpetual victim side to her, and I realize they were both pretty shitty.

Yesterday I asked her to please love herself enough to stop living the way she‚Äôs living, to which she responded by getting defensive, telling me again she‚Äôs not picking up after others‚Äîdeluding herself. I own barely anything especially compared to her. My sister owns even less.... there isn‚Äôt enough room for us in this house. Yet I pay a majority of the bills for this horrible place.

I‚Äôve had this huge phobia of driving, so I‚Äôd always walk or get a ride out, so that‚Äôs held me back a lot but I‚Äôve been going to therapy for the past year, and recently was able to finally get my license. I owe a good bit of money because of the situation‚Äîmy sister was financially ruined from helping my mom and lost her job unexpectedly, unable to get a new one for 8 months.

I‚Äôm also terrified of getting close to people after what happened to me as a child. I have very few close friends so the thought of moving out with some stranger is terrifying. 
Something I‚Äôve been working on in therapy too. I finally put myself out there and had a few dates with people. I ended up panicking and ended dating those 2 people. but it‚Äôs progress. 

I‚Äôve lived here my entire life and leaving feels so hopeless sometimes. I tend to distract myself with ultimately useless things. Feels like the only way out is to kill myself sometimes. My sister has somewhere to go. I don‚Äôt and she‚Äôs not going to take me with her. Been out of contact with my other family members since I was a child. So just been my mom, sister and I. 

Those I‚Äôve trusted enough to tell about this stuff just tell me, ‚ÄòOh just move out.‚Äô People that have families and friends to live with. And it just sucks. 
‚Äî

Sorry for all of that. Just wanted to explain it all. I‚Äôm so tired of this and had the epiphany I‚Äôm not loving myself to allow myself to stay here. She‚Äôs not getting any better. I can‚Äôt make her change. She‚Äôs family but I‚Äôm not letting her drag me down with her.

I live in Houston Texas is there any sort of place I can reach out to either for my mom or me?

I'm a 18 year old college student, I work at a fast food joint that pays me okay.  I live with my mom and stepdad, under an agreement that if i go to college than I can stay rent-free.

I have a decent work and family life, i hit a bit of a rough patch i'm not gonna go into but it's opened my eyes up to things.

I've been realizing how irresponsible i've been with money, college, and my general time management.  I've been staying up for hours and missing my college classes and procrastinating on work which i'm certain is going to ruin me.  I've been spending money on nothing but garbage and just not caring about saving money for things like emergencies and what not. 

I keep having these thoughts of how i can flip myself around, and i have a solution that's really fucking big in my eyes. 

To start, i have a coworker who is actually one of the best people i've met, and has taught me how to handle issues in a good way and learn some anger management skills. he hasn't directly done it and doesn't really know i've been picking up on it but i can't thank him enough.  if you're reading this jacob, thank you so much man.  

He's been having problems with his now former roommates, which i've kinda gave him advice on since he's had to leave work to deal with things they're doing.  

to not go off on a tangent, I feel like what i need to have is a whole environment change.  I need to be put in a position where i don't have many hands to eat from.   I want to force myself to be more responsible.  

My first course of action if i go through with it is to ask jacob if i could live with him and help out with rent and such, it would work out well because he'd have 1 extra ride to work instead of his girlfriend having to take him.  

hugest problem about this, my mom would be absolutely pissed.  I've wanted to move out before but she did not like the idea at all.  she didn't feel like i could do it by myself.  and i don't know how to bring the idea to her.   i live about twenty minutes away from college and me being in the town that jacob is in would increase the distance twenty more minutes.

I really want to do this, or at least try it out.  that's what i wanna tell my mom that it's temporary to help me get my life on track.

is this a good move for myself or could i just find another way"

Persistent friend,Advice,1,dij1sh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dij1sh/persistent_friend/,2,1571223415.0," so uh I came to Reddit for advice.. fun. Anyways. I've got this friend who I see once a week because of a Saturday school I attend. And we talk in class n stuff. But during the week he will seem to send me tons of messages. Some random, about mutral events we are attending or things we have in common. It's fun chatting with him sometimes, but it's gotten to the point where it's getting a little excessive. He'll text me 5-7 times in a row through various messaging platforms.

Recently it's gotten a bit worse. We found out that our schools were going to be versing eachother in a big football game that many people are going to. I sent a message out of kindness, letting them know that I was going. I didnt mean it in like a date or hangout sorta way, just telling them. Now he is making all sorts of plans and texting more excessively. 

He keeps asking if it's okay if we bring some of our friends to hangout together. When I CLEARLY never said that I was going to be hanging out with him the entire time. After I told him nicely that I didnt really want to hang out and wasnt sure what my friends wanted to, he proceeds to assume that its okay if my friends dont tag along it can just be US hanging out. After I RESTATE that I'm still not sure what me AND my friends are doing, he is asking what time and place we are meeting up.

 I'm honestly just kind of fed up at this point and tell him for the 3rd time I am making plans with other friends and we haven't worked out the details. He apologizes for being annoying and I thought everything was fine. He messages me 10 minutes later and tells me where we are going to meet up. WITH or WITHOUT my friends. 

I've given up at this point and I tell him I'm not coming till later (which obviously I'm not) and he is offering to come at whatever time I arrive.

Honestly I'm not that used this kind of behavior and I'm a bit confused. He's clearly not getting the message and I'm not quite sure what to do when this event comes around.

My boyfriend and I had just started having sex and I didnt really know how to feel about it since I was being continuously taken advantage of by my mums partner around that time. I really loved this boy but sex just reminded me of how uncomfortable being molested was (I didnt speak up and had no idea how screwed up it was at the time that I was being groped by an older man). I was much more comfortable with just cuddling.


My boyfriend would initiate sex often but I never wanted to so I‚Äôd tell him no over and over, but he‚Äôd complain and whine and persuade me saying ‚Äúbut I can make you horny!‚Äù even though when he touched me I never got wet down there, and was obviously not aroused, but he wouldnt listen to me. This happened countless times. I ended up giving up and going along with it even if it physically hurt because I wasnt wet enough.


I remember one night he had asked me if I wanted to have sex. I said no, laid down and turned my back to him, then suddenly felt him pulling my underwear down and forcing himself in me from behind. He kept going even when I remained silent.


There‚Äôs this loud voice in my head that tries to justify his actions by saying ‚Äúhe was just young and didn‚Äôt understand consent‚Äù but I know this isnt right.


Typing this all out is making me realise that I think I was raped, but I just need some validation from others so I know I‚Äôm not being irrational about this. I hate that I find it so hard to believe my own brain and feelings."

My jaw hurts whenever I do anything, eat, drink, yawn, anything... they didn't listen because ""well I already booked the vacation months ago and now you are going or else"". Ended up emptying my guts everywhere.

That's just one instance. But they never listen at all. Small instances are for example. I have bad scales in my hair... yet my mom always just ignores me when I tell her to buy anything to prevent it. Been going on for months now. And now when SHE needs it, ofc she buys it.

Worked amazing... was the best week in my life, I could provide for myself and everything... but the government just put me back and well, even thet won't listen.

Told them about my abusive step dad, my mom never listening to me. Never being there or caring and that I wish to stay with my dad instead. They just told me ""You are your mother's kid"" and that's basically all.

I didn't eat because every time I did I threw up everywhere, and well, this kind of parenting makes me just not want to put in any effort in anything... so well, you get a bit more lazy. It's like getting yelled at to clean your room. You don't want to BECAUSE you get yelled at. You know you will get yelled at more but just don't want to do it because of the attitude it was said. You are more likely to do it if it was said with a nice attitude.

Mom keeps saying she wants to kill herself. TLDR at the end.,Advice,1,diiyr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/diiyr8/mom_keeps_saying_she_wants_to_kill_herself_tldr/,1,1571222984.0,"Hey guys. I know this may seem like an unusual post for this subreddit, but I‚Äôm honestly not sure what to do anymore. Let me know if there‚Äôs another place I can direct this to.

First things first, let‚Äôs start off by saying I absolutely adore my mother. She has been my idol for a very long time, and has always been someone I looked up to. She is honest to god one of my very best friends, and I couldn‚Äôt ask for a better mom. We have our ups and downs, but she‚Äôs the reason I‚Äôm still alive.

My father left me before I was born, and my mom had a few boyfriends before finally settling down and marrying somebody **decent.**
He has a very short temper, and they have a bit of an age difference. (She‚Äôs older, he‚Äôs younger.) and this usually leads me and her to believe there‚Äôs a sort of maturity difference.

Now sometimes me and my father get along, but I think we might fight more often than not. He thinks just because he‚Äôs with my mom, that he has full control over my life. I don‚Äôt allow that.

He constantly buys me stuff, that I would‚Äôve bought on my own, just so he could take it away. At least, that‚Äôs what I think. He seems like he‚Äôs been on such a high power trip and it honestly blows my mind.

Now, they‚Äôve split up only once that I know of, before quickly getting back together. I know I care for him because I was begging my mom not to leave him cause he‚Äôs the best father figure she‚Äôs brought into my life. 

But we have a sort of... strained relationship. As in, anytime he tries to be nice to me, it usually ends with him screaming at me. And I tell my mom. She talks to him, and then things are quiet.

He likes to act up with me in front of her though. She‚Äôs told us multiple times it stresses her out, and each time we tell her it won‚Äôt happen. While I rarely bring up stuff around her anymore, my dad still consistently does it.

Like just yesterday. 

So, my dad had just made food. He quite literally screamed at me to come eat, after practically whispering for me to come outside my room. Whatever, it ticked me off a bit but I‚Äôm used to it. No big deal.

I bring my phone with me out of habit, and settle it down right by my plate. It was off and I wasn‚Äôt on it. We were waiting for my mother to come out of their room, (she had just came back from work) and we had started to eat. He got on his phone to begin texting my friend, so I got on my phone as well.

For a small amount of context, I‚Äôm an incredibly impatient person. I find it hard discussing things without getting bored, especially eating. I need to have something to do or it basically bothers me a lot.

I opened up Reddit, and was looking through some posts and reading some memes. By this time, my mother had come out and sat down at the table with us, in a relatively good mood. She knows I like to read posts from Reddit while eating so I don‚Äôt get bored. My dad hates this.

He asks me to please get off my phone. Honestly? I turned it off. I think I said something in protest, but turned it off anyways. 

This really pissed off my mom.

They got into this huge screaming match against each other about me. Where she was telling me she was tired of the way he treated me, telling him that ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt care in the first place if she gets back on her phone, so why even bother her about it?‚Äù 

I‚Äôll admit this made me feel guilty, but there‚Äôs more.

They were arguing about how he treated me. Which frankly? Was like shit. Constant verbal and emotional abuse, and seeing him get chewed out was satisfying.

Until she started sobbing and sobbing.

So we were still eating, and there was this particularly tough part of the steak I was eating, so I was attempting to cut it very quickly. 

This I guess... made my dad mad? He told me ‚Äústop trying to eat fast so you can go run off to your room, you‚Äôre staying here and talking with us. You‚Äôre apart of this conversation.‚Äù

Now, not only was this not my intention, but I hadn‚Äôt added a single word to the conversation since they started.

This made my mom see red.

She was SCREAMING at him, telling him to leave me alone and that he doesn‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm thinking. At this point, I‚Äôve finished my steak. So I get up and thank them for the food, before hiding out in my room to talk with some friends.

They continue to fight for about 30 minutes, before it eventually died down, and they went back to normal. My mom came into my room to wish me a goodnight, and to tell me she loves me.

I thought all was okay. But just now, I took a nap. And there was another shouting match. Full on screaming, enough to make me wake up. I‚Äôm not stupid. They were arguing about me, and she was defending me again. This went on for a while, with me listening in, until she said she wanted to kill herself.

She‚Äôs said this in front of me before, to which I‚Äôve kindly told her to stop- which resulted in a fight between us. 

It was resolved, but it still affected me heavily. She hasn‚Äôt said it in a while, and hearing it again was almost enough to make me burst into tears.

I‚Äôm so genuinely worried that she might do it. Reddit, if she kills herself, I will kill myself too. I CANNOT live without my mother right now. I need her and she needs me the most right now. 

I‚Äôm so heartbroken and confused. I think they might get a divorce if this keeps up, and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I need both of them. They‚Äôve become the two most important people in my life and I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll do without them.

Please. I need to know what I can do to help both of them and myself. Just to clarify, I‚Äôm still a minor who‚Äôs in therapy for a few things right now. Which is why I‚Äôm reacting sort of strongly.

TLDR; Mom wants to kill herself. Dad and Mother have been fighting for the past two days, some of their worst fights ever. I‚Äôm worried they‚Äôll get a divorce.

my friend 15(F) slept with my cousin 22(M),Advice,1,diiykz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/diiykz/my_friend_15f_slept_with_my_cousin_22m/,7,1571222966.0,"So my friend, let‚Äôs call her Josie, is 15 years old. My cousin and I were dealing weed to her (for her grandma) and we were dropping it off. After we exchanged the money with the goods, my cousin drove me home. Afterwards Josie texted me saying that her and my cousin ended up driving around. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it, as Josie was probably trying to kill time or something since she disliked being at home.

However, a few weeks later, Josie ended up texting my boyfriend (18M) and confessing that her and my 22 year old cousin had sex. 

*side note* another thing i‚Äôd like to mention is that Josie often times texts my boyfriend out of the blue, asking him if she wants a drink from the gas station or something; she is always flirting with him in the most subtle ways.

i genuinely don‚Äôt know what to do about the situation, as i was sworn to secrecy by my boyfriend, as my cousin could get in huge trouble + get his kid taken away. we don‚Äôt want that.

so i‚Äôm conflicted, and pissed at them both. what do i say? i can‚Äôt mention it to either of them but i wanna hear the full story, as i‚Äôve yet to hear my cousin admit to it. i‚Äôve been clinging on to this hope that she‚Äôs possibly lying about it, but why would she?

my cousin has had previous run ins with a minor (another friend of mine, 15F) where she got drunk, got completely naked, and unknowingly crawled in his bed and began touching him. this situation scared the shit out of him because he was terrified of getting his kid taken away, and ashamed. he knew nobody would believe him on who do what.

so now i‚Äôm wondering; is she really telling the truth? should i find out?

My talkative classmate won't leave me the hell alone and I'm frustrated.,Advice,1,diiyjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/diiyjl/my_talkative_classmate_wont_leave_me_the_hell/,2,1571222960.0,"Hi, I'm a formerly homeschooled high school student looking for some advice on dealing with an extremely extroverted and talkative classmate who makes me want to rip out my own hair. Please don't upvote this post because she uses Reddit and if she sees it on the front page, she might know it was me. (I'm serious, if this gets over a certain amount of upvotes, I'll delete it).

I'm a bit of an introvert, kind of shy and awkward, and no one knows me all that well yet. So my first day of school I met my homeroom class and they all seemed nice. I didn't really know anyone well, but I recognized a boy (we'll call him Tom) who I knew a while ago, so I sat near him. There was a girl there too and she sat on my other side. I knew her from a very long time ago, and all I remembered about her was that she was nice enough. 

Well, turns out this girl (we'll call her Miriam) is very talkative, way more talkative than I remembered her. That's okay, I need to come out of my shell a bit. She loves classical music, history, video games, D&D, and other nerdy things, and she LOVES to talk about them. At first I thought it was cool that she was so passionate about her interests. I'm a bit of a nerd myself, I love anime, writing, creating original characters, and browsing Reddit and TVtropes. Besides, she didn't have a lot of people to talk to, just Tom, who's in band with her. So I figured she probably was excited to have a friend of sorts.

Yeah, it's been two or three months now and I swear to god she never shuts up. Every day she has something new to tell me. Every day a new topic. She'll ambush me as I walk into school and try to tell me some random thing. If I don't look busy enough in homeroom, she'll show me text-to-speech Reddit videos (many of which I have already seen), or show me memes--even if I'm clearly studying and bogged down with homework. She's gone up to me in the hallway when I'm changing classes and walked up to my locker to tell me things. I'm tired of her shit. And when I try to tell her about something I'm interested in for once, she interrupts me and quickly changes the subject back to her interests. It's annoying as hell. I'm the only person who will listen to her and she knows it.

I just want some advice. How do I distance myself from my annoying classmate without being an asshole? I've been avoiding her as much as possible, but at this point it seems like I might just have to deal with her until we graduate."

Recently when I have been texting my two friends to hang out at lunch, they have been saying they are busy. I haven't talked to them in like 2 weeks and it's been kind of weird in class. Today I messaged one of my so-called friends to hang out at lunch and I got no response. I assumed that she wasn't at school, however, when I was sitting alone in the cafeteria, I saw both walking in with McDonald's. One of my friends can drive so I know that they went out for lunch. Anyways when they came into the cafeteria, they decided to walk past me and sit on the other side of the cafeteria. When they noticed I saw them they started to whisper and then eventually one of my friends called me over. I saw her phone in her hand and at that point, I knew that she saw my message and just ignored it. But even when I was sitting there with them, they were just talking about things they want to do on the weekend, basically making plans without me in front of me.

So I have a best friend who has issues with lateness, overbooking and blowing off plans. This is the 3rd time in a row that she's invited me to do something and flakes out without saying anything. On top of it when we go out to nightclubs she drinks to the point of stumbling and becomes obnoxious. She has a penchant for dating losers just so she can be upset and unload on me about it, blowing up my phone with texts and calls. I tolerated these things throughout our 5 year friendship but I'm at the point where I'm tired of her lack of consideration for my time and needs.

I have spoken to her repeated times about how I don't appreciate having to be on top of her when we have plans and that she needs to communicate if she's running late. I've also repeatedly told her I don't appreciate her making plans with me and then blowing them off without communicating. When she has invited me to nightclubs I have been declining and flat out told her I don't want to go out to places with alcohol since she can't control her consumption. I pretty much cut her off from talking about men. Letting her know that she chooses to be in toxic relationships and if she has a problem with her boyfriend she should communicate her issues to him.

So lately we don't talk as much, we used to talk every day. Mostly because her boyfriend is very possessive of her time. She says she hasn't seen me in a long time, about a month or two. Which is mostly her fault because she flakes out on plans and I told her this. And since this last flaking on our plans I am thinking I should decline any further plans she tries to make with me, since she will just flake anyway.

I guess I'm not sure how else to approach this since talking to her hasn't made her change at all."

I imagined it kind of like a Dairy of a wimpy kid book style, where the story is told through the main character, and you get little drawing they've drawn up to aid the reader in understanding their scenario.  


The issue, is that...well...my art skills aren't really that good, and yes I am aware art is subjective, but to put it in perspective, oftentimes appendages are different thickness's then before, sometimes a character's outfit may have X amount of things and then in another picture be only Y amount (Like Bart Simpsons hair in the older seasons of the show of the same name.)  


I could always excuse this by saying: ""It's just how Character draws"" but that kinda feels lazy to me.  


I'm not sure what to do, I could just not have visuals, but that could make parts where more then 2 Characters are interacting with each other confusing. I could keep them and just deal with people talking about how childish they look. (Assuming people would do that, which I'm fairly sure they would.)

I moonlight occasionally with some carpenter work here and there but still... I hope you get the picture. 


Now the worst thing is my family. Yes I still live with my family at the age of 24 but that isn't the bad part. The bad part is I was raised by a family of abusers who effectively killed off any potential that I had in living a normal life. My mother took me out of public school at an early age and home schooled me to ensure in her words that ""I wouldn't become influenced by the evils of the outside world."" She put all her own anxieties and paranoia upon me and at one time had me believing when I was a young child that parts of the outside world didn't exist that it was just all make believe. 

My father was and still is a magician now you see him now you dont. He would just flat out disappear for months at a time and would show up announced like it was the most normal thing in the world. I think I might've had 10 total conversations with him in my life. Literally the man doesn't want to talk to anybody.  What I later discovered about my father was that all that time he spent away from home was spent on alcoholic benders. I suppose drinking himself into blackouts was his own way of coping with the bizarreness that was our home. He is the one I put the least amount of blame on. I guess mainly because he is like a stranger to me instead of a family member. So the feelings just aren't there. Good or bad. 



My older brother is the worst of the lot and the real abuser. When I was a kid he would scream and cuss at me, bark and growl at me like a vicious dog, threatened to stab me with knives, throwed things, punched and kicked, and on one occasion he pulled one of my father's shotguns out on me and threatened to blow my head off all because I accidentally knocked over one of his gaming consoles. He was 18 and I was 10. All the abuse he inflicted has left me with nothing but pure unadulterated HATE for him. I literally cannot even stand to hear his voice. 


Now that I have given a little bit of backstory here is what I want to do. I want to leave and start over. Put this town and these painful memories in my rearview mirror. I have some savings and a vehicle and I want to head out to California and try and change my pitiful existence around into something more ordinary something more humane you could say. I have no logical reasons to stay and nothing to keep me here. I have been studying and know I can take care of myself. 


So my question is should I do it? Would you do it if you were me? Or would you stay and try to pick up the pieces here? I'm just scared that if I don't go then things will just remain the same and that terrifies me more than anything I have ever went through because I know if they do I will not be able to take it. I cannot allow myself to still be in the same position that I am in now when I'm in my 30s. 
I have already missed out on most of my life and I do not want to miss out on anymore. 

So any advice? Anything at all would be greatly appreciated. And I apologize if this post wasn't the most cohesive as I am in a pretty emotional state right now and cannot think or type as clearly as I usually do."

I went to college right after high school and finished about a semester and a half before I just quit going. I waited about another three-ish years before I decided that I wanted to go back. Once again, I went back with no real purpose. I think I thought i would go and then transfer to a four year and become something that probably never would have worked out. I did really, really well at first and then the stress of living on my own, working two jobs and going to school FT just got to me and once again, I quit going. 

Now, I am a  stay at home mom of two beautiful children and I am so, so mad at myself for quitting. I'm mad that I don't have a great job to take care of them how I would like to, I'm mad that I wasn't more motivated earlier in my life and I messed things up at a time that I would just love to have everything going right. 

So my current issue. I'm trying to go back to school...yet again. This time I have a goal and more determination that I've ever had in my life. i want to go back and get my RN degree. I'm not sure if the same school will accept me for a third time, or how long the probation I'm certain that I will be on will last. I can't get accepted into the nursing program while on probation. 

I can't sleep, I can't stop thinking about it. Anyone ever been through anything similar?"

Ever since the summer of 2019 I‚Äôve been noticing that he gets extremely touchy toward his guy friends (he‚Äôd touch their thighs, rest his head on their shoulders or thighs, give them both regular hugs and back hugs etc). The more I observed, the more I noticed how he never did this to any of his friends that are girls(I have never once heard him show interest in any girl before either). So, I thought he was gay (ik I shouldn‚Äôt assume sexuality but I really thought he was). Afterwords I started losing feelings for him. After completely losing feelings for him, we actually start talking to eachother(we have only talked to each other a few times). We got each other‚Äôs numbers and snapchat accounts and have been talking for the past 2 days(in person and through text). We‚Äôve gotten to know each other a lot more and turns out we have a lot in common. I started getting feeling for him again after a day of talking with him. Today though, he had gotten a little touchy with me. While we were on our way to a award assembly at school I had said I looked fat whenever I wore white. He elbowed my arm and said ‚ÄúNo way! You look good in whatever. Don‚Äôt worry, alright?‚Äù Then when we were in the actual assembly, he noticed that I hadn‚Äôt gotten an award so he had patted my thigh and said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll get one next time!‚Äù I guess he did that to comfort me?? When we were leaving to the next period I had asked him ‚Äúso are you going to text me later?‚Äù He replied with ‚Äúsure‚Äù I turned to look at him and he was smiling super wide. I‚Äôve seen hi look at me a couple times during class too. Do you guys think he likes me back or am I overthinking this?"

My peers are cyber bullying my teacher and I‚Äôm not sure what to do,Advice,6,dibdly,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dibdly/my_peers_are_cyber_bullying_my_teacher_and_im_not/,5,1571189915.0,"I am in 12th grade in high school and I take an advanced English class. My teacher is a little sporadic and can lose his train of thought fairly easily. He is also fairly eccentric as far as my teachers go. That all said, I can sympathize with my peers in that these features can be frustrating at times. 

But the extent to which they express their frustration tends to go a little far in my opinion. My class has a texting group chat intended to be a place to ask questions and commiserate about our English course. It‚Äôs made by and up of entirely students. Some of the messages get pretty heated. 

‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt this f***head s*** c*** piss f*** a**hat just tell us when s*** is due it‚Äôs not hard‚Äù

A valid concern, but I don‚Äôt think the six swears were quite necessary. Additionally, some of my other peers have stalked my teacher‚Äôs Twitter page to find photos of him and then proceeded to crop them into inappropriate situations. 

In general, the way my peers discuss my teacher both in text and in person behind his back make me fairly uncomfortable due to their highly inflammatory tone. I really do understand that it‚Äôs easy to get frustrated with teachers at times, but is it really proportional to their actions in response?

At this point, I‚Äôm really unsure what to do. Should I just sit back and stay uninvolved? Should I report this to school administration? I would greatly appreciate any direction you guys can offer on this situation."
My friends don't think of consequences and I want to help them.,Advice,1,diimdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/diimdj/my_friends_dont_think_of_consequences_and_i_want/,6,1571221279.0,"I'm a male high school student and I have a few friends that don't make the best of decisions. I'm a freshman and they are seniors but they arent always aware of the consequences that their actions will have right away. I don't want them ruining their lives for a stupid reason just because of it. (This post is mostly going to be about one of my close friends who we will call L) So, to start, L is a Senior in Highschool, a Female, and they participate in the band with me. L, when I first met her, had a boyfriend we'll call K. K isn't a good person. L and K have been off and on in their relationships. L sometimes sneaks over to K's house when she isn't supposed to and has one of her friends hold her phone so her parents cant track her. Well, even as a freshman, I know that it isn't smart to have sex in Highschool because things usually just don't work out and that people aren't ready for things like that. But Last week, apparently L and K had sex for the first time. They haven't really been on talking terms, so hearing that today was quite surprising. K in the past has had sex with multiple other people and has told 1 or more of them that if they were to get pregnant that they need to get an abortion. As it turns out, K wasn't wearing a condom and L has only been on birth control for 2 weeks. *Something that I am worried about is that L* ***might*** *have gotten pregnant and that if she is, K will hurt her if she doesn't get an abortion.* Something I want advice on is how to hopefully separate them because K isn't a good person and L doesn't need to be hurt by him anymore (There are a lot of other things that he has done that I can specify more if asked and by hurt I mean emotionally as far as I know.) I'm not just trying to separate them for no reason. L and K have been off and on, and L seems to go back to him eventually every time. But each time they seem to hate each other or at least L doesn't like him and is clearly hurt. She has said so herself. ***I want to know what I can do to hopefully convince her that she doesn't need him and that she really needs to stay away from him.*** (Something that I didn't mention is that K is also in the band with us and is intertwined in friend groups with a lot of L's friends, as well as the fact that L is also friends will a lot of K's Friends.) L is a strong person but I think that as long as she isn't pregnant, that she really needs to exclude him from her life.

&#x200B;

  Another thing that I want advice on is how to hopefully get people to realize that vaping and doing drugs is not good for them. I don't want any of my friends, including L and unfortunately K (we aren't really friends but still), ruining their lives with those types of things either. They vape during school, even though the punishments are harsh for getting caught, and they waste quite a bit of money on those types of things and they really don't need it to be happy. They are fantastic and they need to know that.

I have an unhealthy obsession with this girl on Instagram,Advice,1,diik7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/diik7g/i_have_an_unhealthy_obsession_with_this_girl_on/,4,1571220994.0,"For starters, I'm a young adult female. I have severe hatred towards myself and my looks. I'm overly tall, underweight, thin, have sunken eyes, always ill, dull and scarred acne ridden skin, and very dry hair. I try to dress nicely and I always end up looking awful because my height makes me look distorted. I hate it. However, I follow this girl on Instagram and she's absolutely gorgeous. I love her style, she has so many followers, lots of engagement, beautiful long hair (mine used to be long before a random dude chopped it off..) and hers is the color I've always wanted mine to be. I can't have that color, though, because my hair is already damaged and it's too dark. I think she's stunning and I love her content. But, I've noticed I'm constantly waiting for her to post or I'll watch some of her videos and cry because she's everything I wanted to be and I'm not and never will be. I've tried everything and I haven't had my ""glow up"" moment. Seeing her content is really cool and she's very skillful and I enjoy it, but it also makes me feel many emotions about myself and causes me a lot of self esteem issues. I'm not sure what to do.

Does hair dye damage hair that's already incredibly damaged?,Advice,2,difmn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/difmn8/does_hair_dye_damage_hair_thats_already/,3,1571207244.0,"To give some context, for the longest time, I didn't take care of my hair. It's pretty long, goes down to my belly button, and used to be pretty thick when washed.

I was pretty lazy, and didn't take care of it as often as it needed to be. It was always in the same incredibly tight hairstyle, and on top of both neglecting it and losing weight, it started to get pretty thin.

I've started to take hair supplements https://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Hair-Skin-Nails-Adult-Gummies-90-count/427349485 and have been trying different shampoos and conditioners.
However, it's always gotten in the way, so I've decided to cut it.

The top of my hair is my natural color (which is dark), and the bottom half is blonde (it was bleached a year ago). I've decided to get it cut barely past my shoulders, which will get rid of the majority of the blonde part.

After cutting it, I'm considering getting the bottom half of it dyed a pinkish blonde for an ombre. 

Would this make my hair thinner, and more unhealthy? Should I be waiting until after I'm at my goal weight, and my hair has gotten thicker? 
Should I change my diet in any way?"
Friend of mine lives with me... don't know what to do.,Advice,1,diiii0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/diiii0/friend_of_mine_lives_with_me_dont_know_what_to_do/,1,1571220765.0,"My friend, Mike has been living with me and my family for about 3 months now. 

At the initial phase, one day his mom had started seeing her ex boyfriend (who she was and still is married to, never got a divorce.). This guy is trouble. He manipulated mom to kick him out before, so he let me know and kept me updated, but only as a friend to friend encounter, not looking for a place to stay. 

A few weeks later, my mom and I helped him move to his mom's other ex boyfriend's house. We'll call him M2 because he's also named Mike. 
M2 is a military vet of some type and a really cool down to earth guy. After Mike living with him for some time, I was able to note that M2 seemed lonely. He had a nice house, a simple two story with a nice open living room. He even took Mike's dogs in to his house for the time being. This lasted for a few weeks before Mike moved back in to the apartment under the impression that mom was gonna move back in. 

He lives there for a few weeks on a shit host job at a local restaurant paying him minimum wage for a waiter which is like 7 dollars an hour plus tips which he didnt normally get as a host. I constantly check up on him. He's skin and bones, living on an empty fridge because mom is never home. His car is a piece of shit with no brake pads, and he's hardly getting by. He had been sleeping over a lot because his mom had also let one of her friends and that friend's daughter around Mike's age to stay in the apartment for a few days without consulting Mike. I had him stay over a ton because it pissed me off that mom let them in without telling him despite not living there herself. 

A few weeks later we moved him in. My mom moved her office downstairs, and we all moved his queen size bed upstairs and situated him. His car went... somewhere, and a couple days later my parents met up with my uncle who is a car salesman and got him a nice car for about 8 grand (i think). They paid for the whole thing, and got mike a new job at my neighbor's local business so that he was making a better wage. He would owe money on the car to them and pay them over time as part of his paycheck (just like how I pay them for the half of my car that they paid for)

Life goes on. Recently, he's been all caught up in this girl named Caitie. I havent really seen or heard much. She sings duets with him, watches movies with him, all that gooey stuff. But she also has freakouts at nothing, is a sophomore in college (a year older than he) and doesnt have her own car, and her mom even told her that she couldnt come over to our house today for dinner despite meeting Mike and being cool with him. 

That's a secondary problem. Here's the primary, and god bless if you've read this far:

His mom is back. She's living at M2's house as of now. Yesterday, he went out to dinner with his mom. Tonight, he allegedly upped and left and spontaneously went to dinner with her again today, unannounced until he was one foot out the door. 

My mom was checking in on him due to these frequent visits. She's been in contact with Mike's dad (who lives in long island, parents are long divorced) and is trying to get the child support money to Mike now that he's 18. It seems that every time my mom and Mike go to court for this it backfires or something stupid like Mike's mom doesn't show up. 

After dinner tonight, my mom got a lengthy text from Mike's thanking for buying him the car (she just learned about this tonight) and all this yadda yadda about how she'll pay if dad pays the child support (which he did, she just probably blew it) and blah blah. 

My mom is telling Mike about all this and her view on this and to make light of the situation on her way out, she mentions his concert for school on Thursday. He says ""oh yeah, ive gotta come home, change, then go pick up my mom."" 

My mom came in my room crying and now he might any minute. Also because this took forever to type out, my mom went in there and told him something along the lines of ""i dont want your mom in the car we bought for you"". I dont know what to do, how should I go about this? I want to resolve the peace at home first, then get through Mike's stupid head that his mom is bad for him. 

Ive been as empathetic as I could try to be, and Ive let him take his chances with girls from school and fail inevitably because they were all bad for him. I know you can lead a horse to water but you cant make it drink. But there's gotta be some way. This kid has come in my room crying saying all he wants is a family, after living with us for a month and a half. Its breaking my heart that he feels outcasted yet loved and his behavior is as wishy washy as his mother's which I dont want him to adapt. 

Please help. God bless. <3"

But I can‚Äôt help but think we aren‚Äôt compatible nowadays. We‚Äôre very different and we have used it to our benefit before. But I always feel like I am boring him. I try to talk to him about various things such as TV shows we watch, a podcast I listen to (he got me into the podcast), my day at work, books I am reading, my goals for the future, cool new recipes and health tips, and try to show him how to stretch (his back always hurts). I‚Äôm a very relational person who cares about health. I‚Äôm very fit and enjoy cooking healthy and eating healthy. 

On the other hand, my partner is overweight, drinks daily, smokes daily, plays video games till five am (on days he works even), and loves fantasy things. I try to share my interests with him and have light conversation after we get home from work but he seems to not hear me and won‚Äôt respond to what I say unless I get upset with him and repeat myself louder and ask if he can hear me. 

He regularly plays video games and I ask him if I can join or if we can play a game we can do together while I am over and he says you can watch me play this game and tell me what to do! So I try to do that and he disregards everything I am saying and doesn‚Äôt even acknowledge me when I talk about his game with him, so I end up reading. I try to tell him some fascinating things that happened in my books (about the holocaust, corruption, segregation, other political/moral issues) and he doesn‚Äôt respond. 

In addition, he only initiates sex with me once a week. I am turned off by him because he has gained lots of weight so I don‚Äôt initiate. I never tell him anything negative about his appearance because I am afraid to hurt him but I dearly wish he was active and fit like me. He never compliments my body and hardly touches me. I feel unwanted and unloved. I get more stares from strangers than I get from him. 

He knows he annoys me when he plays his game and apologizes after the fact. I am so turned off that I am dating someone who finds multiple fantasy games more exciting than me. He act like a child on Christmas when he unlocks an achievement but can‚Äôt even get excited at the prospect of actually doing the things he does in games like hike, scuba dive, ski, etc. I love doing those things in real life but he can‚Äôt afford to go so instead I go alone. 

I feel like he doesn‚Äôt even like me that much if he does something he knows annoys me but can‚Äôt stop, like how he can‚Äôt stop drinking and smoking. I don‚Äôt understand why he treat me like he loves me and appreciates me. He gets more excited over a game than being with me or doing things with me. He also only fucks me once a week. It‚Äôs like he only fucks me cause he remembers if he doesn‚Äôt initiate them I‚Äôll be hurt. 

Edit:
He also is really into naked women art and said he kept a list of women he has fucked and a secret file full of nudes exes sent him and said he kept them as trophies.

I‚Äôve discussed all these issues with him. It‚Äôs frankly pretty demoralizing to have to ask someone who supposedly loves you to pay attention to you. If we were really meant to be I wouldn‚Äôt have to feel so shitty about this because he would treat me like a human being

WHAT CAN I DO TO CHANGE? I DONT WANT ALL THE BLAME TO FALL ON HIM, WHAT ACTIONS CAN I CONTROL? Am I truly boring? Am I unworthy of attention? 
Am I asking too much of him? I am so fucking bored of him.

I‚Äôm afraid to leave my bf because he says he keeps nudes of exes on his phone because they‚Äôre trophies and I‚Äôve sent him nudes before knowing this"

So I‚Äôm (21F) in kind of a dilemma. I‚Äôm currently a college student and live in a house with 3 other females. My best friend and I occupy the top floor, and the other two girls live on the main floor. My best friend, let‚Äôs call her Girl A and one of the girls that lives below us, let‚Äôs call her Girl B, and I are all really good at picking up our slack around the house. We clean up after ourselves after we‚Äôve made a mess in the kitchen, had people over, etc. However the second girl that lives downstairs, let‚Äôs call her Girl C does nothing to help out. Yesterday she left a big box in our kitchen next to the garbage can after receiving a package. Okay, no biggie, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll discard it sometime over the next 24 hours‚Äù. Nope. So Girl A sends Girl C a picture of it and asks if she can move it because there‚Äôs no reason for her personal belongings to be residing in our commons space(s). Girl C gets pissed off, and begins to ignore Girl A. This, by default, upsets me because Girl A is my best friend and one of the nicest people I‚Äôve ever met. So I call a little meeting, I tell everyone I want open lines of communication and I want everyone picking up after themselves, it‚Äôs only fair, right? Well Girl C screams at me, ‚ÄúIT‚ÄôS A FUCKING BOX!‚Äù Okay. Girl C does nothing to help out; doesn‚Äôt take the trash to the curb, doesn‚Äôt empty recycling can into recycling bin, doesn‚Äôt empty dishwasher, leaves a mess in the kitchen every time she cooks, etc. At one point during our discussion, she actually said, ‚ÄúI just think you and I have different standards of cleanliness‚Äù ????

For the most part I'm over that right now, but every time I do something to get out of depression I go back in.

When I'm studying and working hard and focusing on classes, I often feel lonely. I try working for a good gpa, but then I look at all the people studying in the library and ask myself, ""why can't I have a friend group like that?"".

I get feedback that I need to get myself out there and participate in school activities and clubs to meet new people and make friends.

When I do that, often times I can't manage my school work and my extracurriculars, and I get super stressed. What I've realized I do is, when I'm involved in something I put less effort into those extracurriculars and focus on my studies more, leaving the people I've met through those extracurriculars hanging. 

The cycle goes on with each step of the cycle bringing me into and out of depression.

When I go into depression, I wake up at 2pm instead of my regular 6am, and I binge watch funny TV shows where all the characters meet up everyday, try to do well in school, and have fun with each other.

I haven't seen her in like 5 months, but I'm going to see her tomorrow, and I'm probably not going to see her again for a similarly long while after. We used to be decent friends (we could hold a conversation, but we didn't really actively seek each other out), and I liked her then too, but I never told her. I've decided to just go ahead and ask her out before we drift too far apart. I've been obsessing over the last month or so about what I'm going to say to her, and I've been beating myself up about not just telling her before. However, now that they day is finally nearly here, I'm starting to feel like I don't really want to tell her. Maybe that I don't even really like her in that way.

I'm worried I'll follow this feeling, not tell her, and regret it later. Here are the possibilities I've thought of for why my feelings have done this to me:

Case A: I'm just getting nervous, since the thing that I'm going to see her at is also a pretty nerve-racking event (Midterms), and I'm just shutting up my feelings until I deal with the other stressor, and afterwords I'll regret not having said anything. I've done this before, and the regrets afterwards suck.

Case B: Even more worrisome, I wonder if I don't actually like her, and instead I've fallen for some fantasy idea of her that my mind has concocted over the past months to fill the romantic void in my mind, and I don't actually like the real her anymore. The only reason I feel that this might not be true is that I've *actually* liked her for many years in the past. If I go ahead and ask her out, and my feelings turn out to be for the fantasy, I'll probably regret it no matter what happens. I've also done this before, except it was a lot more obvious because I had never really even had a conversation with the person I was fantasizing over, so I didn't ever ask them out.

I'm thinking I'll probably get some indication of what to do once I'm actually speaking to her, and my real emotions have a chance to show themselves, but I'm also worried that I'll actually like her, but I'll chicken out, and rationalize it as Case B.

I've been so frustrated over the last month about not being able to talk to her, but now that I have the opportunity to attempt to establish contact with her, the fact that I'm considering not taking advantage of it is making me question my sanity and my motives. In that order."

My boyfriend and I have been living together for a year. Hes the one who begged me to move in even though I had a job where I was at and could live without any bills whatsoever. I moved out of my grandmother's in another state and moved to his house. I moved to my grandmother's because I cant stand my family. 

My family is loud and obnoxious. I am a recovering alcoholic and at my parents house all my dad does is black out. To me, that is enjoyable and makes me want to drink. My mother just had surgery and is taking painkillers which she has been on before but now she has more. She gets incredibly angry and bipolar when she takes them. My brother is autistic and plays video games you can hear from the other floor in the house and does not respect privacy, in fact no one respects privacy as they all always just open my door (even though I lock it, you can twist it a certain way to pop it open which they do) and hes constantly shouting. 

My bf asked me to go to my parents house for a night so he can have some time to himself. Yesterday was our one year anniversary and he brought this up later on in the night. I talked about this to my mom and now she wants to go to  have my dad pick me up on his way home from work, have a family night and in the morning go with her to the mall. Later on in the day I have a court appointed group that's 3 hours long and it's a 2 hour bus ride there and a 2 hour bus ride back. 

After expressing to him about how I dont want to see my family now hes saying I dont have to leave but I feel guilty not leaving. He mentions that I text them a couple times a day that I must not hate them but in actuality it's easier to text them than it is to talk to them in person. I dont want to go to my parents house. It makes me anxious and stresses me out. Also I know tomorrow is going to be a long and drawn out even and with the group I go to it's going to be 3 hours to get there instead of 2 because my parents are farther than my boyfriends. I offered to leave the house all day and he'll mention to ""just hangout and spend time with my family and grab a few of your sweaters."" Grabbing a few things and bringing it to the group and then on the bus is something I dont want to do.  

Would running errands all day and then group be reasonable? I just dont want to sleep over my parents house.

The core of it is: I don't know what to say to people who I know somewhat and maybe even have stuff in common with. Like for example, I don't know what to talk to someone about who is on my team for a debate, or my general classmates as we wait around. I don't know how to form connections with people so we can move from awkward small talk to comfortable with each other. I don't know how to joke around with people. Hell... I've even had people try to get me to be comfortable and who do like me and try to connect with me, but they give up because well, I literally don't know what to say to people. Any interaction is just standing in silence. I feel like I just dissociate from the moment.

This has led me to avoiding social situations because I notice people start to think I'm unfriendly or don't like them, or at worse I will make them feel awkward/uncomfortable. I started to believe that I am just not good enough to sit next to certain people, and I don't even apply to jobs because I think that my professors will be embarrassed to back such a weird person who avoids people.

Of course I don't have a single friend and everyone in my class has at least a few friends and are generally accepted and liked amongst each other. I've just become the one people avoid.

"Racial Privilege in a Supposedly ""Professional"" Environment",Advice,1,dii9cu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dii9cu/racial_privilege_in_a_supposedly_professional/,1,1571219512.0,"Hi, I'd like to clear up that this is actually my Wife's story. She has a manufacturing job with a very big Company. She has had troubles with people before, and this concludes my theory that race privilege is very severe in this case. 

There is no racism here, just a perspective from reality. My wife is white, very white, while I am Asian. Onto the point...

She works on a job where there is a ""Chain of Command"", the Section leader, Supporters, offline support, and workers.

Recently, a new girl was hired for the job, and she came in to the job all ""Sassy"" and back-talking, also says ""I don't F\*ck with White people."", you know, the overall. Fortunately for her, this manufacturing area is dominantly Black, with the exception of my wife, and maybe less than 10 other mixed races at most. 

This girl had caused trouble for my wife while training under her, and my wife is one of those ""silent"" working non-attention seeking people; she doesn't really fight. This really hurt my wife's performance on paper, while the new girl suffers nothing for it. Recently, this new girl got to go train under one of those ""relax"" jobs, which was usually reserved for the veteran workers or the more experienced people -  Which my wife is well qualified for. So now the new girl gets to jump ahead of my wife's career, because she is Black, the Section leader, Supporters, etc. all in favor of her because she is black? 

Many instances my wife has experienced racial favoritism, from getting overworked compared to her counterparts, promotions, etc. This new girl can back-talk and sass, have her hair out of OSHA regulation, but my wife can't let one strand of hair loose or she gets written up. 

I take it that it's not just favoritism for the new girl, because it happens for most the rest of the ""black"" people too, while the few other races among themselves admit that there IS racial privilege, and they can't do anything about it. I know this sounds absolutely ridiculous, but it is reality, and usually when anyone speaks up, it gets shot down as ""racism"". I know my wife's coworkers who are black, realize this too.

Obviously my wife isn't going to keep this job for the long run, but is there anything she can do legally? It isn't fair that her performance is automatically over-ruled by people, just because she isn't ""Black"". She just wants to go to work, do her time, and get paid. Not go to work, Flirt with all of the guys, back-talk, make everyone's lives harder, and ignore ""white people"" because she doesn't ""F\*ck with white people"".

I get it, racial preferences happen all the time, white, black, Asian, Mexican, Undead or Blood elf. It's unacceptable either way, and I know that in my workplace, race is nothing but words. We are all equal and we are placed in the chain of command based off of performance. I want my wife to feel the accomplishment I felt, because I worked hard. Not because I related to the race of my superiors, or even kissed ass. She doesn't deserve this. 

I am really asking for ANY kind of advice.

What are the legal steps my wife can take to equalize the benefits? Are there government outlines?

How can I assure my wife that working will pay off in the long-run? This job is well paying for our age, but with all this going on, it really makes my wife feel unaccomplished and work will be a drag for her. 

&#x200B;

Sorry if this is too much to read, I am only cramming 5% of the situation into little short paragraphs, I may get backlash, but I hope you guys will see the frustration. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR - Wife's less experienced coworkers get better job opportunity, they all happen to be black. Qualified and  experienced people are open to apply for Supervisor positions, all the people who didn't make it happen to not be black."

She benefits from this by getting extra pay (she will pocket all/most of it) and getting her family off her back for being gay (she feels comfy enough with me to take a few romantic pictures to send home). I will benefit from this by being declared independent for financial aid purposes and getting healthcare. 

My parents aren‚Äôt helping me with college at all, which is partially understandable due to how much my health has cost them. I don‚Äôt wanna go into details, but I have an extremely expensive medical condition. My parents can barely afford it and their salaries should make us upper middle class. 

I‚Äôve got scholarships for college that would leave me paying ~$7k a year, which isn‚Äôt bad, but when you factor in the costs of medical care, my special diet, interest rates (w/o a co-signer)  etc., that is unmanageable. Marriage would mean access to pell grants, other need-based aid, and good health care. 

We both think that this is a sound idea, for the most part. I feel kinda guilty about this, as it (in my opinion) is basically fraud. I feel like this is unfair to people who pay taxes toward the military - they want their money to go to actual families, not broke and disabled adults who are just tying to get a head start in life.

So I don't mind when he sends me links to listen to.  But uh- well it feels like he's a bit obsessive of her.

**And that might be completely unfair to say.** I am quite obsessive over my own hobbies and interests- but I don't let them consume my identity and conversation. Pretty much **all** texts he sends me are about this singer. Be it screen shots from the fan group he is apart of, fan art others have done of her, pictures of her, or him kinda just rambling on about how awesome and wholesome and perfect of a waifu she is. *He was looking for an artist and willing to pay over a hundred bucks to get fan art of her drawn looking more fantasy-esque when he really doesn't have a lot of money.

To be clear I'm not remotely feeling any jealousy here- we're just friends. I just don't know how to respond to all these messages he sends every other day. *(Infact, I haven't responded at all...)* They read to me hyper-fanboy and since I'm not a hyper-fan of this person (or any individual really) I don't know what to say. I don't want to be disingenuine- and I don't want him to feel like he can't share things with me, it's just **a bit much**.  I guess it also comes off concerning to me with how attached he is to this person but maybe I'm overthinking it.

My boyf and I have been together for a year and a bit. I was always a ‚Äò virgin till marriage ‚Äò kinda gal ( engrained in me since I hit puberty) until one drunken night I had sex with an ex who turned out to not be as good as I thought. After we broke up I started sleeping with a guy from work and to be honest I began embracing the fact that I was a sexual being and that I was grown enough to enjoy sex. 
Then I meet my now boyfriend and we begin a relationship. He‚Äôs had more girlfriends with me as I was way late to the dating etc club and one night a month into our relationship he randomly says. I wish that others have had sex with you. I see you as the woman who will be my wife and long term and the fact other men have been with you physically makes me so upset. ‚Äò 

I suggest breaking up and he‚Äôs like I‚Äôll have to think about it. The next day he says no no we can work through it and that he‚Äôs over it. He could see how upset that comment made me and he hasn‚Äôt brought it up since. Throughout our relationship here and there we talk about the past naturally and I know once he mentioned he had a girlfriend in his early twenties and that they were too young and immature and things fizzled out. had it been later in life things would‚Äôve been different. I asked if that were his first sexual partner and he said no but I was hers. 
This jus makes me feel this pang of jealousy and makes me feel like I‚Äôm a used up toy that he‚Äôs having to settle with and if he could back he‚Äôd have never let her go. 
He‚Äôs always talking about our future, marriage and children and I‚Äôve noticed that since he made that comment all those months ago I‚Äôve thought about them everyday and they planted a huge huge seed of insecurity.

This is gonna be somewhat long. 


I‚Äôm now (18M), and I‚Äôm currently in my first semester at my local community college with a plan of transferring to a uni (UCI) for a degree in computer science. That was my plan for most of my life. I was the video gamer geek type and I thought it was the best path for me since middle school. However in the span of time between my senior year and now I‚Äôve been with a strong episode of depression and anxiety, which has totally made me reevaluate my life decisions since it has severely damaged my already mediocre work ethic. I‚Äôm doing the best I can do deal with it,( Therapist, general anxiety meds, working out etc.) but as of now I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm at a crossroads regarding my education. I tried utilizing both private and the free college math tutors at my school but I couldn‚Äôt pass any exams for the first half of my calculus course. I ended up withdrawing from my calculus class because a combination of lack of understanding, procrastination and huge amounts of anxiety. The alternative was failing the course. I have to take 3 higher level math classes and some physics courses in order to graduate. I don‚Äôt see myself going into computer science because of it. On the upside, my city gives us about 6 semesters of free tuition classes for our local college. So I‚Äôm not wasting my parents money or the money I have from my part time job.

My main issue of distress is what the hell do I do now? I have no interests in anything practical career wise. The stuff I‚Äôm ok or good at like writing essays or analyzing text, doesn‚Äôt make good money in the real world unless you‚Äôre lucky. My parents don‚Äôt really know what I should do since neither of them went to college. My therapist doesn‚Äôt have any solid advice either.

I‚Äôve failed and embarrassed myself so much recently I don‚Äôt want to try anything new. I‚Äôm too scared to do anything. My semester ends in a month and a half and I have no idea what to do. Do I change majors? Do I climb a mountain to discover myself? Do I run away and start a farm? I feel like I‚Äôm floating through my life right now. I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself. Any input is welcome. Thanks."

It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever; this guy and the convo we had have no impact on my life at all, yet I can't seem to shake that voice, which just leads to me overthinking the way I ended the conversation, thought spirals, etc. Any tips on what I can do to help alleviate this random anxiety over a non-issue that came out of nowhere? Thanks, all"
Am I becoming germophobic?,Advice,3,dictk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dictk2/am_i_becoming_germophobic/,4,1571195840.0,"When I was little, I paid no mind to being dirty of not showering frequently/washing my hands. Now, with 21 years, I noticed if I don't wash my hands every 2 hours I feel disgusting (I don't work in any environment my hands get dirty).

I noticed other things as well: I almost always skip cuddling right after sex (as I like to do) because feeling sticky because of my partner's sweat makes me anxious, I am compulsively washing my head as well thinking I am with oily skin, and my ears never seem clean enough to me.

I don't know if it is adulthood that came with a good sense of self hygiene or if I am becoming germophobic/obessive-compulsive.

How do I make friends? I'm very lonely and I want to take a break from dating and tinder. I've been going to a ton of meetups but it really more feels like we're people all doing something at once rather than anyone actually wanting to make friendships."

So first I am a graphic design artist just recently graduated, and one of my first aspiring goals is to become and art director and go from there. Right, so back in May right after graduation I didn't wait around to look for a job, I was hunting online, going to offices and asking around, even my former teacher tried helping but nothing and I got super depressed, and anxious cause I just spent a few years and money and I'm starting to second guess my self. Now at the time and at the end of that semester is when I met my true set if friends, like I mean true friends and they've always been there to support me. And at the same time I was chasing after a girl and over that summer even though I was down, when I was around her I pretended my problems did not exist. At the end of the summer though a company I talked to said they would take me on as an intern and instantly I took it, it was one and only shot and a for sure ticket ya know. When I started my boss asked about my goals and I told her. The day I started she came to me and said ""we usually have two designers at a time, but since the other dropped I will not only train you as a graphic artist, but to be an director as well, and when the internship is done I will put in a referral for you to be a director."" And ever since she have truely been the best, but in the first two weeks I got an offer out of state, and ice always wanted to work out of state because where I live now isn't exactly the best for graphic design. Now the girl I mentioned before we were close to dating but when I told her my goals, she flipped and it turned to an argument, and we parted was, I won't talk about what was said because it no longer has relevance. Now we get to the part where I need help. So the same night, a friend of mine comforts me over what just happen, and I've known her for a while now, but never seen her other than a friend. And since then we've hung out like every day and talk all the time, and when we talk there's this energy and it's never negative. So for a while I just focused on my self, but a few weeks ago we were talking and she brought up the words "" her boyfriend"" and before that moment I never seen her other than a friend, but when she said that I got mad, because how she said he treated her and just uses her. We talked and got past it and things were normal, until Sunday. We talked again Sunday but this time, I couldn't keep my feelings inside, and neither could she. She didn't exactly say she likes me, but I think that is part in her being in a relationship, but we said all these things about each other, like how we are our true selves with each other, and how we want to spend more time together. And since it's been very different, and now it's good morning, goodnight, how's your day, what are you doing ect. And we went out last night and it's was soooo different we couldn't stop looking at each other, smiling talking or anything, but there was a moment and maybe I'm reading too much into this, but she ""compared"" hand sizes and hesitated like she wanted to hold hand or more, but she pulled away as if forcing herself.

or ‚Äöif I was this other guy, we would‚Äôve gotten here much sooner because he is more attractive‚Äò

,she probably has had many better looking guys than me in the past, so I‚Äòm just a 3rd,4th,5th choice‚Äò

I started to look around askWomen to see how much looks matter to them, and every thread basically said it‚Äòs essential for attraction. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, its also essential for me but im generally attracted to many girls.

So I think, why even bother trying if there will always be a guy at the club who can take her away in seconds, because he looks better than me.

Its very self-sabotaging and kills my self-esteem.
 

That of course translates to real relationships, but I think personality counts much more. But I still have the thought of being a second choice over someone else."

We went to the same school and had a lot of mutual friends. We was both very happy people but decided after two years that we were better off with other people and stayed close friends. We talked everyday for months after until I met someone new and got with her. My Ex didn‚Äôt like the new girl and we argued and stopped talking to each other. She then blocked me on all social media platforms. A few weeks later one of our mutual friends called me at 3am and told my that my ex had been telling everyone that I used to rape and abuse her. 

For additional context, my father was a drug addict and an alcoholic that used to beat and rape my mother and my ex knew this and knew how much it affected my life.

Over time I had more and more people telling me what my ex had been spreading about me. Luckily as far as I‚Äôm aware, no one believed her.  But in my mind I felt guilty. And even though I knew I could never do anything like that. My mind was telling me I did. One of my best friends knew how I was feeling and confronted my ex about this. My ex then openly told everyone she lied about the whole thing to hurt me but it didn‚Äôt make me feel any better.

This has severely affected my mental health, in the relationship I had after my ex I had loads of troubles in the ‚Äúbedroom‚Äù. I couldn‚Äôt maintain erections and this led me to a deep depressive state. When I could maintain erections my gf had to be so clear that she wanted to have sex and was fully consenting, a lot of times this killed the mood. Me and that gf broke up after a few months and I slowly came out of that depressive state and I‚Äôm now with a new GF who makes me so happy and she is so understanding. But now as a 21 year old man this still affects me quite severely at times and I often find myself falling into a depressive state. 

How do I overcome this? I could never hurt anyone and everyone around me knows that.  But this can often affect my every day life.

However this is not the first time. I‚Äôve met him 3-4 times this month and all of the times we have met has just been us arguing. I cannot remember what it was but even if it was just a small argument it is still causing a bad mood in the air.

And on mobile at that. Please go easy on me if I make any mistakes.  It‚Äôs also more like rant to relieve the stress and burden of my situation!

I am the youngest child of five, I never grew up wealthy and my parents both have mental illnesses which has created a dysfunctional relation ship with drugs, alcohol and each other. The oldest child is poor, but stable regarding a SO, children, and finances. Doesn‚Äôt have any addictions but switches between hobbies constantly to help it. The second oldest is a single father with empathy issues lives with me and my parents. The second youngest, only 22, not that much older than me, is now severely physically disabled due to a recent illness that has hit him. This has resulted in huge anger issues, constant physical pain, depression, and an over use issue with marijuana and other pain killers. I am as previously stated the youngest, and as a result I am the lightning rod, I have dealt with quite a bit of mental and physical abuse. To the point of even have a case file at my local police station. How ever in the most recent years, my late teens; life has seemed to die down as siblings have moved out for schooling and a new beginning. My mum, a major alcoholic, has retired  from a stressful nursing career and has begun to do self reflection. My father has finally gotten treatment for severe OCD, anger issues, and  personality disorders. But I am still the lightning rod for everyone. 

 Disregarding me, I want to talk about my sister, the middle child. Let‚Äôs call her R. R was a sweet child, she had tons of potential but once she approached Highschool she got sucked in to a horrible friend group. One which abused her kindness, used her body and was mean. This set off some biological trigger that set off a chemical imbalance. It was present in all other family children other than her. She had the family hereditary depression forced on her. That always what the doctors said. Added symptoms include paranoia in our family; we all handled it and have gone through counselling most of our life. She didn‚Äôt. She wasn‚Äôt prepared and with the abuse of her so called friends. She became suicidal and had attempted multiple time by her 16th birthday. But after she got treatment she got better but the scars still lasted. To help those scars my dad would give her tons of weed to help with the pain. It lead to her using alcohol as a crutch when she wasn‚Äôt high all the time. Then she went back to the friends who hurt her. They got into hard drugs and that rubbed off on her. One day though she had an epiphany and went to rehab. It didn‚Äôt work; we thought it did but she lied. A year later, she is now a university graduate and in s stable relationship and owning a house. But on our last visit, we found drug paraphernalia and booze bottle everywhere. Five days later, a call from her boyfriend she hasn‚Äôt gotten out of bed for five days, quit her job, and has only been smoking and drinking. No food no excersize no shower.  She has admitted to drinking nearly empty beers found in dumpsters, picking up used cigarette buds to try and smoke, and when it was all taken a way by her boyfriend (even id and certain phone apps) she even ate coffee grounds in an attempt to get high. It horrible to see. Her boyfriend has sent her home to live with us cause he can‚Äôt handle having to pay the bills, take care of her, go to school and be the subject of her anger. I understand fully why he kicked her out of their house. She‚Äôs in such a rough state it even has caused my heart problems to spike to a bad level. She doesn‚Äôt want to change, but she wants us all to put the effort in any way to help her. Currently my house has all medication locked up and we can‚Äôt even get pain meds without her trying to get to it. 

How can I help her get to rehabilitation again with out causing a fight and how can I support her with out risking me or my family‚Äôs newfound health and stability? 

P.S i am a Highschool senior trying to work and get my life in order for schooling and the real world. And I‚Äôm not trying to be insensitive, I love my sister; I‚Äôm just worried about the effect it will have on my stable but sensitive family.

I was in a car accident when I was very young that left me paralyzed , in turn came a lot of other problems. 2.5 years ago I got hospitalized for being extremely sick and basically steering head on to death ,important to note I was trying to kill myself or rather that I had made peace with the fact that I would kill myself, I starved myself which quickly spiraled into many other problems due to my body not being strong enough to support everything that ensued,got pneumonia and a bunch of other shit stacked on top of each other that made it very hard to tell what the actual problem was. This went on for 2-3 months before I had a breakdown and asked to be hospitalized after going back to school and not being able to breathe properly anymore.  
My main physician in hospital was the same one I had had for 10 years now so you could say the man was trusted by me and my family we didn‚Äôt think a doctor would try to steer us to a worse circumstance. I was open from the beginning about being suicidal, it was hard to miss,and so began what I thought would be the journey to recovery. A lot of small blood test were done and they were pumping me full of meds for approximately 2 months before I started asking why I was getting worse,and had not gotten a clear answer on what was actually wrong or happening, my doctor refused to talk to me in person and would do his ‚Äú rounds‚Äù when I was sleeping which was quite often due to extremely strong psych meds and being weaker than when I was admitted to hospital. I had lost more than 30kgs I was losing all my hair at this point and I had developed some wounds. The wounds got worse,I got worse everything got worse and  this went on for months, in total 9months ish possibly more. I know this sounds stupid to stay where I was getting worse but at that stage I was 17 and still under my mothers guardianship so I couldn‚Äôt be released without her consent and unfortunately she had more faith in our Dr. than anyone else on this earth, every time I had a mental breakdown about my health declining the blame was shifted on me wanting to die and that I was ‚Äúsabotaging‚Äù myself which was never a he case since I had been admitted.  Around August I had basically cornered my Dr. after over dozens of surgeries and had asked him if I was going to die anyway why can‚Äôt I die at home? Why am I here and getting worse? My Dr. then broke a giant bombshell in which he stated that I had bone infection in my hips , they had known since the he beginning of my stay,and that there is no easy way to say this but my legs would have to be amputated due to the level the bone infection had gotten to. At this stage I had just turned 18 and my Dr had given me no option besides death or amputation and possible death, and I had said I would never choose amputation and would rather die. Shortly after I got released out of hospital still extremely ill but at that point our medical aid had stopped paying for anything and they had no choice but to send me home. During the time at home my dr. Had given me a ultimatum for when I would have to decide on the amputation by, everyone said if the amputation would save my life then I should do it and that I don‚Äôt have a choice , but shit didn‚Äôt make sense to me and I kept denying. 
We ended up getting a call from someone working for our medical aid doing a check up on me because it had seem strange to them as to why I had just spent 9 months in hospital and wasn‚Äôt getting better, my mom explained the story to them and they had noted that something did not seem right and insisted/booked us to go see a specialist as a second opinion. I didn‚Äôt want to see anyone , I was afraid it would be a lot worse than it was , but agreed to go anyway. In the consultation room of the specialist I had told him my story and he looked extremely skeptical as if I had just thumb sucked everything out of thin air and that I was flying about more than half of the real story, he asked me how the DR. Had determined I had bone infection and I couldn‚Äôt answer because I legitimately didn‚Äôt know , I was so drugged up more than half of the time and I‚Äôm theater the other half that I had no actual idea when what was happening. The specialists examined me and saw my (basically now septic ) surgical wounds , and had found medical debris ? Left behind and grown into my wounds causing further infection , he immediately booked me into this new hospital to get the shit that had been left in my wound removed and clean out everything . I went for scans and test and everything and I came back with no bone infection , I was having a mental breakdown at this point because nothing was making any sense anymore nothing seemed real. My doctor had lied about everything and had worsened my situation tenfold and I was busy dying. I had nothing left in my body, not enough blood not enough nutrients ...nothing ,I had gone into shock a few times with a heart rate over 200bpm among other things.  My resting heart rate at this time was 170bpm without me moving , I was in the worst shape ever but the new specialist and his whole team managed to over the course of a year fix me. 

Now the opinion/advice part the old Dr. had forbidden my mother to take me to other doctors and had told her he would deny everything if he were to be questioned. They had never documented or put on record a lot of the stuff that had happened to me and basically made a lot of the torment  i experienced out as if it had never even happened. He has since then retired after having a heart attack after receiving a phone call from my New doctor who was left with the shit show he had managed to cause ( might be a coincidence might not) . It‚Äôs been a year since I have officially been out of hospital and it‚Äôs great but a lot of what happened has left me traumatized beyond anything I can accurately describe , I don‚Äôt trust anyone. I will not go near a doctor or a hospital if it is not the doctors that fixed me. I am insanely depressed and I have anxiety.I feel like my life had been thrown away for almost 3 years and now I have to try and scrape everything together again. I feel useless and worthless ....What should I do or opinions in general ? 
(I was offered to sue him but I feel so fucked up mentally and physically that I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd make it like even talking about the whole situation triggers me into suicidal thoughts and even some sort of ptsd episodes, I feel like everything that transpired was my fault for wanting to die in the first place and that it would be turned on me if I had to take legal action)"
Today: New job offer and relationship break up,Advice,2,diec7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/diec7h/today_new_job_offer_and_relationship_break_up/,4,1571201870.0,"Hi all,

I'm not sure if anyone has ever experienced this before but today I received a job offer for a role abroad. It's about an hour flight away from where I'm currently based in my hometown where I currently work. The offer is good, it's in a global company and is the type of role I would like to get into. But also today independently of and before the offer my long term partner told me she wanted to break up. 

&#x200B;

I am at a total loss. I have no direction or idea on what to do. If the relationship is not salvageable I am uncomfortable with moving to a new role, a new country, a new city, new surroundings all whilst grieving after a break up. It could also be seen in a positive light of a fresh start. But for me I think it best to work on myself in my hometown until such a time I feel strong enough again. The new city is rather small and rural, so it would leave the door open for a lot of time spent alone until I can build up a friend network there, I have friends and family in my hometown so that wouldn't be an issue if I stay. Has anyone experienced or heard of a situation similar to this? I think I may pass on the offer until I am mentally and emotionally in a better place.

Thank you"

To introduce myself, as well as my issue;
I'm 25. I recently moved out of my parents place (well, last year really).

I moved to a rather expensive place so money is constantly tight (paycheck to panic to paycheck essentially).

I have a stable job with decent prospects and everything but that doesn't change the problem much unfortunately.

Furthermore, I live in Sweden, and the apartment market is ridiculous (no matter where you live in Sweden, moving involves several years of queuing to get hold of an apartment) thus, moving is essential out of reach.

Anyway, that was a lengthy description. On to my question;

What would you suggest, to easen up the economy issues? My personal thinking has been some ""gig-jobs"" during the weekend.

My interests are linguistics (I have a diploma in advanced english from The university of Cambridge (which ironically isn't proven by my English in this post)), electronics, digital art (another diploma in digital design from my local college).

I don't have a drivers license so uber/uber eats as well as any drivers license required gigs are out of reach for me.

Open for pretty much any and all suggestions."

Career switch!! I Need advice,Advice,1,dihdvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dihdvo/career_switch_i_need_advice/,2,1571215279.0,"A bit of context. I recently got my Masters degree in Teaching English which qualifies me to become a teacher of English and consequently have a career as that. This is career option number one. 

I currently find myself more in tune with photography more than I ever was. I've enjoyed photography for a long time but it's just recently I sensed that I got better at it and I took it as a serious career choice. I think the reason why is that I've been unemployed for a couple of months now which left a huge chunk of my time free. Photography filled that gap. The catch is that I take pictures with a phone as I can't afford a camera right now being unemployed. This is career option number 2. 

I find it hard to commit to either one because I haven't made up my mind yet. Photography is great and can be profitable and fun but most often than not it's just alot of freelancing. Meaning that you have to properly finance your life since there will probably be timea when there are no jobs available.
Teaching, on the other hand, is more stable. You have a salary for each month with some benefits. I understand even with a salary you can screw up ruin your life financially. It just more stable. This is a major factor as to why I am confused.

I really need advice here. I don't know whether to drop the career switch idea and stick with teaching or going full in and take a risk by chosing career option 2.

I am 19 and she is 22. She lives about 6 hours away, so next month we are gonna meet in the middle in a motel and have two nights of fun. (I know shes legit, we video chatted the other day and messed around on there, so there is no doubt she is fake)

I'm a virgin, I haven't even held hands with a girl romantically, and I don't know if its a good idea to do this. My rationale is that I can gain experience so when I do find someone, I will be more experienced. But then again, should I wait until I find the one?

I'm a very sheltered, I haven't had a GF. So that means no hand holding, no kissing, no cuddling, etc. Is it wrong to waste those first things on this girl?

We are really vibeing. We share similar interests and she is really cool. But I don't know her that well. She did say that it wouldn't probably go past being a FWB situation. But she did like the idea of getting to know each other, should I not do it so that I don't get hung up? (But wouldn't that be the same if you had sex with your girlfriend and then dumped you?)

I am really at a crossroads. This is something that my family or friends would never think I would do, they were shocked when they found out I had a tinder. I would love some advice from another dude who may have been in a situation like this."

I was bullied and ostracized a lot when I was in middle school and ended up being homeschooled so I was isolated a lot of time. I'm in college now and while I've adjusted well academically, I'm struggling to make meaningful friendships or honestly just do anything involving other people besides for a few things in my comfort zone. I seem to do well at small talk and can get up to getting thier number or a vapid promise to hang out again, but that's it. I get too scared to call them and ask to hang out, and it's like I have go through a huge anxiety-filled hurdle to do so and it's so exhausting. I get this urge to push people away and just do stuff I can do alone, like studying and watching youtube or writing (my favorite hobby)

Like I was walking by the courts and saw kids my age playing. I wanted to so bad to ask if I could join them, it would have been a great way to spend the night and hang out with people. But I just got so scared they'd say no and make me feel humiliated, I don't want to feel that way ever again. I don't want to feel like that defensless stupid little kid again. So I just walk past, even as this super cute girl kept staring at me, as if she was hoping I'd ask. I'd probably completely read her stare wrong, she probably thought I was a creep or something.

It's making me tear up, to be honest. I feel like I'm wasting away my younger years and I'm going to grow old and alone and regretful. How do I actually build up the skills to connect with people and create friendships and just you know, learn to be a kid again? I want to change this, I know absolutely zero people will see this but any help is appreciated. Thank you in advance <3"

A bike is out of the question because they're too big, sadly. However if you've got an idea but aren't sure if it'd work for planes, let me know anyway and I'd just use it for the other one or two. 


I've tried rollerblades before because they're compact and faster than walking but they take way too long to get on and functioning, also they don't work that well on stairs. Furthermore since you can't just get them on and off, on top of stairs, hills and bumpy roads are a huge negative in the reliability department. The skill ceiling on them is also pretty high, I'd say at least 10 to 20 times higher than a bike but only 5-10 times higher than a skateboard. 


My dream-item would be something you'd imagine Robin or Batman would pull out of their utility belt and it'd fold out into some mode of travel. Since I'm not aware of anything like that in existence and Bulma's Capsule motor cycles aren't real either, I'll take what I can get."

This morning I changed my facebook status to single. Not 30 minuets later my emotionally abusive ex (26m), who had violent tendencies but never struck me, reached out to say he was sorry that my relationship ended, and was available to talk and grab coffee if I wanted to. Now I know how these things go, but I'm not that girl that left his apartment at 1:00am, scared out of my mind and carrying what little belongings I could out to my dad's car, in tears. However I am emotionally vulnerable and he was and will always be my first love. I'm not going to get coffee with him but I have unblocked his number on my phone and we have been texting back and forth since. He's going to be graduating soon from Chiropractic college and is super excited for me that I'm a pre-med student. I'm afraid though if I continue talking/texting with him, all those feelings will flood back and I will fall into the cyclical trap of abusive relationships. So I'm asking reddit, should I cut him off cold turkey, or should I hear him out over coffee?

TLDR: Boyfriend of 8 months broke up with me yesterday and now my ex who was emotionally abusive is reaching out and I'm confused if I should hear him out or not.

UPDATE: First thank you to everyone for the advice! It was hard but I told the abusive ex (not my recent ex he‚Äôs a good guy) thanks for the offer but I need to take care of myself, which means moving on from my past which includes him. He promptly sent me a barrage of disturbing  texts that varied from cruel and concerning to outright harassment. I have blocked his number again and might need to seek a restraining order. I‚Äôm staying with family for now until I figure out what to do. This has been a hell of a week.

UPDATE #2: I let my roommate know about the situation because my dumbass turned on my location settings on my computer which I was messaging him on, and now there's a car that's been parked on our street for about 4 hours, that's the same make and model as his.

I'm hoping I'm worrying about nothing, but as time goes on, I'm getting more concerned. It gets a bit dark... If this is the wrong sub, please let me know. 


I have a friend who's in a long term relationship of 10 years. I know they've had a bit of a rocky patch recently. I don't see either of them much as I moved a few hours away, but still stay in regular contact over WhatsApp and Facebook.

It was my friend's birthday on the 8th. His partner left him a lovely message on his Facebook. Normally, her spelling and grammar is incredibly off (she spkz lk ths). The message was typed perfectly. Almost like he wrote it. Not too weird though right? 

The very next day, the 9th, I get some strange messages from him, saying her mental health has massively deteriorated over a short space of time. He claims she's been sectioned. Based on how he was messaging me, I was a bit suspicious about this. But still, support my friend as it sounds like a horrible situation.

The 10th - my friend posts a status on Facebook, saying goodbye to everyone and that he's always loved his partner. This alerts my friends who go to his house, Break in and find him on the floor, drunk, with vomit containing tablets next to him. He's taken to hospital and my friend is put as his next of kin, as he's not got any family (dad's dead, mum also suffers from mental health and is rarely out).

My friend gets a phone call from the hospital to say he's discharged himself in the middle of the night.

Nobodys heard anything from him since and there is almost zero online presence except for a brief Facebook log in from him a few days back.


His partner on the other hand (who also has no close family to speak of, and is very isolated as she isn't from the same area) has literally disappeared off the face of the earth. No sign of her online since before all of this. The last thing being that Facebook message.

It's now been 5 days since his attempt. And 7 days since any sign of his girlfriend. We've tried speaking to all friends who are concerned and we'd all been told contradicting info, varying from them splitting up and her living at her mum's, to her being sectioned. 


We've been to his flat. There's no sign of him there. And we're all getting concerned.


He's a big guy, she's a tiny girl, and I know he suffers with pretty bad mental health. So we're fearing the worst, but hoping what we've been told is true.


We don't want to go to the police, incase he's telling the truth as that may make his mental situation worse.


Is there anyway to verify his story, without potentially causing damage? 


I'm worried he may have hurt her, panicked and made up things to tell his friends, then tried to take his own life. Now they're both completely off the radar. I'm hoping I'm just being silly though."

I saw this girl on instagram and she was super beautiful so I dm'd her so I could get to know her, this was around halloween of 2018. So over the past couple days I get her snapchat and we do all that and about a week later I get her phone number. So im talking to this girl through text and we start talking more and more frequently as time goes by. I ask her to hangout sometime about 2 weeks after I got her number and she said she wanted to get to know me more first, which I understood because we were complete strangers a couple weeks ago. So time goes by, thanksgiving, Christmas, new years, and I'm still texting this girl. So its valentines day comes and I still haven't seen her in person but I know I'm not being cat fished bc she's been snapping me and just other factors that prove that she's who she says she is. Still to this point I've still haven't seen her, but I have asked her out again multiple times but every time its the same thing, she finds an excuse to not keep our plans. By this point I like this girls personality  and all I want to do is just meet and spend time with her but shes always finding an excuse. she says she likes me and wants to see me, wants to go on a date with me, saying this and that so I know im not in the friend zone.

Basically what I described before kept going on until still to this day october 2019. I just dont know what to do theres so much detail to this story I know im missing so much details. So ive actually called her out about 2 times throughout the year of how she said she wants to see me but never falls through with the plans and how I'm the only one trying to say something up to see each other. Now its literally been over 10 times ive asked her and the same results. she says she's busy and that is the reason but she wasn't doing anything for most of this year, she barely started going to school this fall and previous only had a job for a month. She says she doesn't have time but every month she always goes on roadtrips with her friends for a couple days and even went to Hawaii to spend a month there while im just here waiting for any opening in her ever so busy schedule. Through all this shes still texting me like all day everyday. Idk im all the place trying to explain the situation, it just makes me sad how id do anything to spend time with her and it seems like she doesnt want to. Like I said before I called her out on this and she keeps saying she does want to see me this and that, and im the type of person to not give up on someone so thats why when theres the slightest bit of hope I stick around. It just bothers me that if shes says the things she does how come she never puts her words into actions. Should I just give up on her."

Coming up to 1 year anniversary,Advice,1,dih0py,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dih0py/coming_up_to_1_year_anniversary/,3,1571213516.0,"Not sure how serious this post will be taken as I‚Äôm currently 16 writing this but I hope I can still receive some advice:

My girlfriend and I are coming up on our 1 year anniversary and she has been the only girl in my life I‚Äôve ever properly fallen for; myself being the same situation for her. We are still pretty obsessed with each other and she is still so cute planning our anniversary meal/already got me a present etc (it‚Äôs in approx 3 weeks). This post is not about whether to stay with her or not: I love her to pieces no doubt. However this post is more about getting advice on whether I give us a clean slate and put the guilt (I‚Äôve given myself) behind me...

Being 15/16 and both of us having our first proper relationship: we lost our virginity to each other a couple months in and have been sexually active since. However because we live around 35 mins away from each other and she has quite strict parents, sometimes we have around 2 weeks average between having sex. Would obviously like it more often but that‚Äôs the logistics of the situation. 
However this is where I made a mistake. Around 6 and half months into our relationship she suddenly seems to really distance herself sexually and basically wasn‚Äôt horny at all, for the first few weeks I just presumed it was hormones with her period or something however it seems to persist. Long story short it Lasted over 2 months and so during that time I still had just as much of a sex drive but it wasn‚Äôt being able to be fulfilled (sounds selfish, not meaning it that way just don‚Äôt know how else to phrase it). Therefore I made the stupid stupid mistake of 1 day accepting the offer of nudes from a girl I‚Äôve been friends with for years. She sent but I never sent anything back, only her.
As soon as I came I instantly had a huge wave of regret and realisation and I honestly burst into tears and felt like instantly apologising and trying to explain to my girlfriend. I was so disappointed in myself I can‚Äôt tell you. I told the girl, who sent, this and she said ‚Äúno of course not, you‚Äôre just having a bad moment‚Äù. Anyway I felt really shit about it for the next few days and had such guilt: slowly it‚Äôs faded however I‚Äôm in all 3 subjects at College with this girl and so every once in a while i think back to it and it still hurts me that I did that and my girlfriend doesn‚Äôt know.

As you‚Äôve probably guessed by now the question is: do I explain all of this to my girlfriend now and obviously apologise to fully clear my mind before we cross our anniversary... or not.?

For extra context: 
- My girlfriend and I often talk about situations with other people / how the person would react but all theoretical. She is not a really controlling GF but judging by her answers to theoretical situations, I think it‚Äôd really upset her and especially the fact I‚Äôve hidden it for so long would worsen it. 
- My GF thinks the girl who sent the nudes, is really slutty and disgusting already because she sends to loads of guys literally most nights of the week still. 

Thank you to anyone who has read all this: some of you may think this is a huge overreaction if you have a lot more open relationships however I hope some of you can understand my situation etc."
I(15) am worried that homeschool and my mom are affecting my social life.,Advice,2,didrh1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/didrh1/i15_am_worried_that_homeschool_and_my_mom_are/,6,1571199582.0,"It all started when I went into homeschool in the 6th grade, I had just moved so I didn't really make any close freinds to talk too after I stopped public school. My mom was acting normally at first, maybe a little over protective but nothing too serious. But then she started saying that she didn't want me to start dating until I was 18. I didn't think anything of it because I figured it was just normal overprotectiveness. But then she moved that age to like 26. I thought that seemed a little excessive, but I still just brushed it off. Then she started talking about ""my future"" and she started planning the rest of my life around that rule, including stuff with college and my career, and stuff like that.

 Then, she started talking about how guys and girls shouldn't be friends or else the guy will fall in love, or something like that. Then one week, when a family friend of ours came to visit with a daughter my age, my mom seemed very weird about the whole situation. Then after they left, my mom started going through my phone, asking if I was texting or dating her (i barely even talked to her, being that it had been about 3 years since i had last talked to a girl my age.) For about a month after, she keep reminding me that people my age shouldn't date or else they'll break up and I would be really depressed, or that the someone would get pregnant and it would ruin our lives.

 One day a little after, I was talking about wanting to go back to public school or some sort of place where I could be around kids my age so that I could make friends. Then she started talking about how even boys my age are bad to be around, because they're bad influences and will peer pressure me to do stuff. She says that I should go get a job to work at during the day, or something like that so that I'll be around adults, if I want to get out of the house more. 

 One time, somewhat recently, my dad (their divorced) took me out to see an R rated movie. My mom is alright with violence, but when it comes to anything sexual, she hates it. I think that she might have wanted me to never learn what sex is, I'm homeschooled and was never taught anything about sex, even though I was taught about normal pueberty stuff. Anyway, after she heard about the movie, she seemed pissed. She said something about how she thought that I was safe from learning all that inappropriate humor because I am never with people my age.

 Now I don't know what to do. I'm thinking about going back to public school next year. My dad is alright with that, and even though I only get to see him on the weekends, he has 50/50 custody so he could send me back to school if I wanted. The only problem with that is that my parents have a very bad relatonship and just talking to eachother about something simple leads to fighting. Trying to do something as extreme as this would lead to a very unhealthy home life. I feel like I need to do something soon, or else I'll move out with the only people I know being my family. I'm also afraid because I feel like the isolation is distancing me from women. It's not too bad with other guys my age because I've got brothers, but being so long since I talked to a girl my age, I'm afraid I'll become mysogonistic or have some other problem that'll get worse the more I'm separated.

 What do you guys think I should do? Is my moms parenting toxic? Am I just being bitter? Any help is appreciated."

Since it bordered a fence with our neighbor and provided a significant shield privacy, I gave my neighbor a heads-up a couple of weeks before removing the trees and informed him I would replace them with young trees that would provide privacy again over time. For the moment, the trees barely clear the fence, so we both still have a clear view into our homes about 40 yards apart. He received a quote on fence lattice, but it would be $1,200/each, which we simply can't spend right now. As much as I don't want a clear line of sight, I'm OK with waiting a season for the trees to grow - he's clearly not. I want to be understanding, but not $1,200 understanding."

Today we met again, I prepared myself that there was going to be kissing again, and he tried making out and again I always stopped him (not because of not liking it) I was just getting nervous and awkward and didn't know how to act...

I just don't know what to do or act, I do want to be in a relationship but I just feel so stuck! don't know how to freaking french kiss, just feeling weird in my mouth

could any of you give me some advice? what's appropriate, how to act maybe, how to keep advancing and not staying in the same place?

We had a conversation about it, he understands that I find this difficult but also can't not advance in a relationship and I understand that, but I can't control my nervousness and fear.

Former acquaintance demanding large finders fee?,Advice,1,digq98,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/digq98/former_acquaintance_demanding_large_finders_fee/,3,1571212143.0,"Hello reddit,

My parents are real estate agents, and they do business off a network of friends and referrals from friend-of-friends. We are doing average (around 50-55k household after taxes) but don't feel very secure, especially with a mortgage on a new home.

Recently a former acquaintance of theirs referred them a client, and after the deal closed she said that she expected a finder's fee of 30% (\~3000), citing previous arrangements with other real estate agents. Typically, my parents give the friend a CostCo gift card of a few hundred bucks (\~500) as a thank you, not as an arrangement.

My parents are conflicted on this: my mom wants to give the amount as she doesn't want to make any enemies, and thinks the acquaintance will be angry if we don't satisfy her. My dad is distressed at the lost income, as he already rebates  40% of his commission to the buyer. He doesn't want to give anything. Then the brokerage deducts another portion (\~500).

(for clarity, I think it is 30% finders fee after deducting the rebate).

I suggested something like 20%? Both disagreed, they said it wouldn't be enough to satisfy her and we'd be no better off not doing anything in the first place.

I would appreciate any advice. Don't know what to do. Want to try and help.

EDIT: Another factor to consider, maybe future referrals? :/"

I used to be outgoing, socially capable and generally well liked. As I got older I found myself retreating into myself due to highschool shenanigans, bullying, and observation of the overwhelming amount of hate in the world.

This has, for the most part, led to me becoming increasingly misanthropic. I generally see people as NPCs on my journey through life and less as people. When I receive compliments, my brain automatically assumes they want something from me. I can't trust anyone except for my best friend. I do not like this and it prevents me from experiencing more viewpoints and opinions. 

Every once in awhile I am lucky enough to experience the kindness of others who are genuine and want to be kind. However these people make me sad and uncomfortable to be around because I feel unable to fully express my gratitude towards their kindness. This in turn  causes me to sabotage the relationships in fear of causing them harm (which then causes them harm).

I'm sick of being alone and full of distrust, but I'm afraid that no matter what I do, I'll never be able to fully accept that other people care. Is there any advice from y'all that could help me see humanity in a better light? Thanks."

I moved out for about 8-10 months, before they asked me to move back in with them so they could afford a new house. I did that for about a year, then just got my own place last month.

Right now, my friends are going through a lot. To best summarize, they had their child about two weeks ago, and he's probably not going to make it. So... pretty horrific situation.

Anyways, the last year I was living with them, despite them *asking* me to move in with them (I was paying quite a lot in rent, it was helping them out), there was kind of a weird ""barrier"". Like... they would go out with friends and have parties, and specifically not include me.

I just kind of chalked it up to us spending too much time together (I also *work* with my friend), but still, it kinda hurt my feelings. mostly the fact it seemed so ""secretive"", like they didn't want to even *know* they were doing things (I've literally never invited myself along anywhere, so no idea why they were like that).

Well the past two weeks, I've been there a lot for them. I've been checking in, asking if they needed anything, I went by before work one day to drop off breakfast for them, just generally trying to make sure they didn't have to want for anything during their stay.

Anyways, he eventually said they were just going to stay at the hospital with their son, they didn't want any visitors. I completely understood, just told him to let me know if they *did* need anything.

That was about a week ago. Yesterday, he texts me and asks if I wanted to see the baby (I wasn't even sure if he was still *with us*). I said absolutely, and went there straight after work. Well turns out, I'm actually getting roped into helping them get everything packed because they're finally leaving the hospital. Which hey, that's great, I was super stoked, even though the prognosis for their son still isn't great, he's finally getting to go home after two weeks.

But... when we get back to their house, I feel like I just sort of fade into the background, they're busy letting everyone *else* know how much their support meant. And they also let it slip that apparently, they'd left the hospital one night to have a party at their house.

Obviously, they're going through a lot, and I'm glad I've been there to help them. But on the other hand, I also feel incredibly taken for granted, and even a little betrayed that ""I'm a good enough friend to ask for help, but *not* to invite to parties or anything"".

I'm personally thinking about just kind of cutting ties with them at this point. I've known him for about 12 years, her about 4 or 5 years, but it just feels like this isn't a ""friendship"", so much as ""I'm here to help them whenever they need it"".

I dunno. Am I in the wrong on this? Or am I justified in at least being upset? I obviously wouldn't confront them about it, and probably won't, but it feels like it's just kind of a one-sided friendship."

She's really upset"" and he stopped laughing, apologized, I said it was fine, and they went on their way. I should mention that I live on the ""terrace"" level so my bedroom window is right here for everyone to walk by, which is fine. I keep my curtains pinned shut so I can have some privacy.

So this evening my window was closed. I hear the same cat SLAM INTO THE WINDOW and start howling. I see the dog, dont see the owner but I hear him tell the dog to follow him. I was on my way out the door and was going to ask him if he could try to not let his dog get so close because it really upsets this one cat, and Im honestly afraid she's going to hurt herself, and if my window is open I dont want the dog amd cat both pushing through my screen and potentially breaking it (the dog does press on the screen).

So i go out my door and dont see the guy, but I was on my way to the gym and the leasing office is right there. I am NEVER a Karen and didnt want to start shit, but I did want to ask the leasing office advice I guess? I dont know. I don't even know which apartment he lives in and wasnt trying to get him in trouble, but also I feel like just because my bedroom is located so low to the ground doesnt mean I don't deserve some privacy.

I get to the office and i tell her I don't have a problem yet but Im worried it may turn into one. I got two sentences out before she describes the dog, what time the events occur, and say that it's a male owner. They've had MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS about the dog not being leashed and she was literally about to call him because around this time is when he gets home to walk the dog. I reiterated it seems like a nice enough dog and my interaction with the owner was not negative, but she says not to worry, I am far from the only person to say something in the last couple of weeks.

I do my thing, get home and pop open my windows so I can get in bed and zone out on my phone. I hear my cat swat at the window, whatever it's fine. I figure if it's the dog it's leashed and maybe since it's far away my cat will get used to seeing him (she's been around dogs before and normally isnt this bad).

Well.... as I was going to sit up to pull my curtain over more, I hear the dog owner cussing about my fucking cat. I don't think he said much other than something like ""its just a stupid fucking cat"" but he sounded REALLY angry and I'm kinda nervous now. It sounds super cheesy I guess but I do not do well with men being angry towards me.

Anyway, the point of all this is WHAT DO I DO?! do I act like I didnt say anything if he asks? If he walks by again and cusses loud enough for me to hear again (he definitely could have been quieter) do I go outside and try to be friendly? I'm scared I could have upset the wrong person. I live in a really nice neighborhood but I dont trust people. 

Or i guess i could be blowing this all out of proportion? Am I even entitled to expecting someone to not be at my window or let their animals on my window?"

Obsessed over neighbour's TV noise - how to stop focusing on it?,Advice,2,dicssb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dicssb/obsessed_over_neighbours_tv_noise_how_to_stop/,6,1571195756.0,"This is going to sound trivial but it's genuinely been bugging me. 

**TLDR: I can't stop focusing on/tuning into neighbour's TV noise through the wall and I'm always ""waiting for it to happen"" and it's driving me mad -- how do I stop?**

I've recently moved to a semi-detached house in a semi-rural area and every evening I can hear my neighbour's TV noise through the wall. I've always lived in elderly neighbourhoods and all my neighbours were quiet so I didn't realise how thin semi-detached walls can be up till now. I've talked to the neighbour, who has dialled it down. But we can still hear it -- or at least I can. 

Right now I know, rationally, that their noise level isn't unreasonable -- if I have music on I can mask it. (Before I spoke to them it was loud enough that I couldn't). But the area is so quiet otherwise that the noise is really noticeable for me. During the day it's like pin-drop silence and as soon as neighbours are home it's TV noise. Very start contrast. So I am always on the look out for it -- I literally tense when I see it's about that time they are going to start the TV again, and it might be louder or quieter depending on the days. (We work from home a lot of the time).

Hubby says I'm obsessed over it (he doesn't even notice most of the time) and I have to agree. I just don't know how to stop focusing on it. It's like waiting for the other shoe to drop. I'm not sure if it's reasonable to ask the neighbour to lower it further -- especially when hubby don't think it's much of an issue. I definitely don't want to be unreasonable on this. 

I think it's to do with managing expectations -- I've lived in urban areas with much more noise before and I was fine, because I expected that kind of noise. But when I moved to this rural part I was really expecting quiet -- or at least quiet from neighbour's TV. They have really loud dogs too but I'm less annoyed by that, for some reason. TV programme also tend to have peaks in noise like when loud ads or someone's shouting in it, so it's grating, and it doesn't ""fade"" in the consciousness, so I'm constantly tuned into it. 

I don't want to put in extra soundproofing walls or anything like that because I know the current noise level probably doesn't warrant that (not to mention no time and space for that kind of thing), and moving is not an option because we love this house and area otherwise. I really need to stop focusing on the neighbour's noise, especially to stop ""waiting for it to happen"" -- it's draining and I know it's counter-productive but I don't know to stop. It's a bit like don't think about the pink elephant, well you are thinking it. Don't listen to the noise, well you are listening now! 

Any help would be greatly appreciated."

Improving sleep hygiene (long post),Advice,1,difxt3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/difxt3/improving_sleep_hygiene_long_post/,2,1571208610.0,"Hey guys, 

So I'm trying to be a responsible adult and get a proper sleep hygiene going. But I don't really know where to start or how to get routines going.

 Especially when it comes to going-to-bed-and-getting-up routines; I never had such a thing. It's especially hard for me to try and force myself to establish one as I'm an night owl; I don't get tired enough to go to bed before 2 a.m., yet I need to be up by 8 a.m. most days (ofc, even that's not regular) cause of uni. 

I live with my girlfriend, her mom and a cat in a three room apartment. The GF and I have a bedroom that doubles as her office cause there's no space for a second table for her desktop PC. Plus, our bedroom is pretty cluttered. Actually, the whole apartment is, really, cause my GF's mom seems to want to fill every nook and cranny with shit. The cat is relevant cause that little motherfucker literally smells it if you need to sleep cause you have to get up early and goes berserk right before you fall asleep.

Anyway, I tried to keep my phone out of the bedroom, but I didn't really know how to keep it that way. I left it in the kitchen for a week so I had to get it in the morning, but I'm just so used to chilling in bed with my phone, especially on weekends.
Speaking of electronics, we have to resort to our laptop for uni to watch Netflix etc cause our TV in the living room is so old it couldn't even receive the signal with one of those fire sticks. Cause of this, one of the laptops is running until we both feel asleep and shuts down if we watch something in the evening.

Another problem with the TV situation is that when my GF's mom is home, the TV is on permanently or she's on the phone really loudly or she constantly tells you unfunny stories etc. which makes it impossible to concentrate on a series, studying, reading or what have you in our kitchen/living room area. So I only have the bedroom as a semi quiet and private space to myself.

Because of this, I also can't just stay in the kitchen until I've had my fill of Netflix or reading and then go to bed. Also, if I read or watch something until I nearly fall asleep, the moment I get up to go to bed I'm 100% awake again and all was for nil. 

Also, my GF goes to bed very late, doesn't seem to care about routines like that, and ends up waking me up when I'm asleep before she comes to bed.

 However, afaik for proper sleep hygiene, you're only allowed to sleep and have sex in your bed cause of subconscious associations. 

So what am I to do to keep the bedroom a room for just that, sleep and sex, when the living room is usually filled with distractions that force me to stay in the BR when I need to be productive?

TL;DR - how to establish sleep routines and a healthy sleep hygiene if your living situation works against you?"

Today my mother **screamed** at me at the top of her lungs when I was explaining to my brother something very trivial, and we couldn't agree on an answer. She then threatened to sell some of my things.  She does this constantly because she ""hates arguing"". It causes more problems than it solves and causes me to feel hopeless when I am mistreated by someone and try to speak to them about it. 

Every time I feel upset, am crying, angry, distraught, or anxious, my brother smiles at me in that stupid fucking smile. It isn't a normal smile. It's *that* smile. Sometimes he laughs. He doesn't care about anyone else's problems most of the time, but he does delight in them. My parents refuse to believe me.

During that whole time, I was too shy to approach him and just paid it no mind. 

But this sem, maybe it's because this is my last sem and I'm 100% sure of my feelings, I finally decided to take matters into my own hands and talk to him. I hired him to be the photographer on an event that wasn't supposed to exist but does now because I blanked out (I was so stupid). 

Then after a lot of convincing from one of my friends, sent him a message in fb at around 10:30 PM asking him about photography. 

During the whole chat, he took too long to reply and his replies were too short. And that discouraged me a lot. I was so ready to throw in the towel when a friend of mine pmed me and told me that she saw my crush in the mall around 8 PM looking exhausted. Maybe he was just tired? 

And so, I told him he seemed tired and we should stop the convo. He then said that he wasn't tired and continued it. But I told him to not force himself and he listened because he sent me a link to a vid that would help me get started on photography, told me to never stop being curious, and said ""Good night (my name)."". 

I thanked him for the link, promised to update him once I watch it and said gn to him as well. And he said ""You're welcome!"" And that was the end of it. 

I really thought that went well. But I guess I thought wrong. 

The next day, around 3 PM, I pmed him about my feedback on the vid and asked if he took any pics using the rules that were given on the vid about photography. Around 10 PM, I saw he was ol and I was anxious. I waited for his reply but it didn't came. 12 AM and still none. I sighed and decided to just go off and do something else. 

And now, a few mins ago, I checked my messenger and turned out he replied around 2:55 AM and he only said 1 sentence ""I use them whenever I take pics"". 

That discouraged me. What am I doing wrong? I really thought we were doing fine. And to think that I did research on how to know when a shy guy likes you and he did almost everything to me the whole time we knew each other (i.e, staring at me often, glancing away when our eyes meet, visibly uncomfortable when we talk irl, his friends teasing him when I'm around).

Guess I was delusional. Do you think I should give up now before I dig my grave even deeper? Because honestly, that's the most enticing option for me rn."

How much noise is acceptable from my musician neighbors?,Advice,1,difqi8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/difqi8/how_much_noise_is_acceptable_from_my_musician/,3,1571207709.0," I live in apartment building. The corner apartment next to mine has a number of musicians living there who are always making music. The walls in my building are not thick. So a trace amount of BOOM BOOM BOOM is almost always audible (they make dance beats). Sometimes its obnoxiously loud (to which I pound on the walls and they stop for a bit) and other times it just enough to be audible enough to be very distracting but not unbearable. The music is never consistent, its always starting and stopping, repeating and very jarring because they're making it (opposed to just playing a song). It's VERY repetitive. Because of the music bass heavy nature, a lot of it comes through the walls even though I know they are in the furthest room in the house. 

I haven't tried my LL yet as I'm not sure if I'm being too uptight about it or not.

I work a lot from home so it's really starting to get distracting. I am just wondering if I am being too sensitive or not.. and then on the other hand i feel like i shouldn't have to live with headphones on 24/7 in my own apartment just to be able to concentrate. 

So how loud is too loud and at what times should people be quiet? I usually let it go until 10pm and then bang on the walls until they turn it down.

Just looking for any kind of advice or shared experiences on my situation. Thanks."
Good traditions from other cultures,Advice,1,difpsm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/difpsm/good_traditions_from_other_cultures/,8,1571207630.0,"Hey,

I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask, but it's the first one that came to mind.

I'm European and I was wondering what are some of the other cultures' traditions or unwritten rules regarding manners, social life or personal life. I've recently started meditation which would probably make 90% of the people from my country laugh, but it's working for me. That's why I'm looking for other ways to improve my life that I haven't thought of, but are usual in other cultures.

If I'm in the wrong place, please suggest subs that would fit this question even more.

Thanks in advance!"
Engaged but fianc√© hasn‚Äôt told family,Advice,1,difp62,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/difp62/engaged_but_fianc√©_hasnt_told_family/,8,1571207560.0,"Hi so I‚Äôm desperate for advice as I may have made a mistake in trying to trust someone. 

I‚Äôve been engaged to my fianc√© since October of 2018 however I ended the engagement in summer of 2019 due to some difficulties in our relationship. We recently got re-engaged as we decided we need to work on these things and wanted to spend our lives together so we obviously thought ‚Äúwhy aren‚Äôt we engaged? We need to try again because we shouldn‚Äôt give up on each other like this‚Äù 

Anyways he‚Äôs never told his family as he‚Äôs worried about their reactions and also because his older brother when he told his parents about him getting engaged, his mom flipped. His mom seems ok with it now talking about his wedding which is on the weekend (I‚Äôm not invited though because I‚Äôm not close to his brother or family that way due to the distance)  

So it‚Äôs understandable, however since being re-engaged, I don‚Äôt want to be kept in the dark. I want to finally tell them and for us to be able to move forward. I‚Äôm not worried if they‚Äôre not or are supportive as I‚Äôm not marrying them however I know it might matter to my fianc√© so I do my best to not make or start anything with them. 

Anyways i ended up texting his brothers gf who he‚Äôs marrying in a couple days and i told her because we may plan to tell his family during the winter but she‚Äôs now telling me she can‚Äôt keep this a secret from his brother. 

Which I understand that nobody wants to keep secrets from the ones they‚Äôre with but I asked her kindly to let my fianc√© tell his brother on his own and to just help by trying to ask for his brothers support so he doesn‚Äôt regret telling him or anyone. 

Was I wrong for telling her? I felt the need to as I wanted to start knocking down some of these things and I wanted it to be known that our relationship is serious as it came off to me that they didn‚Äôt think we were serious as I wasn‚Äôt invited to their wedding and I don‚Äôt want people thinking that just because we‚Äôre not the typical couple to post things on social media of us all the time or hardly. 

I‚Äôm a little worried that she may tell his brother and he won‚Äôt be supportive and end up blasting it on my fianc√© which could blast back to me and cause unnecessary drama."

Ever since I (18F) had a string of bad experiences with online communities a couple of years ago, I've really struggled to establish some kind of 'permanent' presence on forums & sites like tumblr. I do not lie about my age, general location, really change my personality, etc., etc. ‚Äì all I ever change is the name I use. The problems start whenever I put out anything that I consider less than perfect and/or start interacting with a wider community. I always get trapped in the line of thinking that I'm just forcing stuff on people or they're just indulging me as so to not upset me, which just escalates to me really wanting another 'fresh start' and trying to get  everything right.

TLDR; I can't use any online outlets for my interests because I'm weirdly obsessed with everything about my presence being 100% interesting and faultless. What should I do?"

Complaining about your parents in my age is a normal thing, right? But when I do that, I just make my friends concerned about me.
But it's not like I know what to compare to, and it feels like this is normal. I want to keep it kinda short, but if you feel that I missed out on something important, please comment and I will tell more in detail.

My mom has, some toxic parenting traits. But she's a very nice mom, usually. I think. But I don't know where the line draws. Where is bad personality traits start being considered toxic? When is parenting start being abusive? 
Taking silent treatment as an example. Toxic right? But I don't think it's that uncommon. I haven't personally met someone who has experienced it, but it doesn't feel like something that would be so rare.
But last time I got it was when I was 12, so 3 years ago. But if we take something a bit more common? Picking on one's appearance. Not toxic? But how much is the considered toxic? What about guilt tripping? Manipulation?

My friend told me I should try at least reading into child support. And maybe moving away. But it feels like that would be overreacting. I've read a lot about above parents, and sure my parents book off a lot of check marks on the traits list. But still, it's at that lvl when it's too much to ignore and it affects my mental health...I think? But wayyy to little to searching help and even moving away. My parents would never accept me back if I did that. That's why I feel like I'm overreacting."

I lost my friend,Advice,1,diesq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/diesq5/i_lost_my_friend/,10,1571203761.0,"I ( F 15) recently lost my best friend and lover (male 17 ) for a stupid reason. I know I am young for love and such but I actually felt something with him. We were friends for a year and he had recently gotten out of a relationship with his ex over the summer.   ( I'm gonna call him Spider because I don't wanna keep saying he) Spider and I would talk about our failed relationships late at night until  2 am and keeping each other company. After a month of us becoming close friends ( before the summer started we just said hi in the hallways and went on with our day) he said he started catching feelings for me and wanted to be with me, but didn't want to date yet. The thing is I thought he was joking because he at first sent me step-father X stepdaughter porn. He sent this because he called me his daughter, the reason he called me his daughter was because he was always there as a ""father"" figure. So that just caught me off guard because I thought he was just tugging my strings. I asked him if he was serious he kept saying yes but he wanted to try friends with benefits with me.  At first, I was skeptical because that meant I had to be intimate with him and send dirty pictures because that's what teenagers do now of days, and I didn't want to be the girl at high school with her nudes being airdropped like  I had witnessed my 9th-grade year. He reassured me he would never do that so I gave in and became friends with benefits with him. Fast forward a month later and when he asked me to finally have sex with him. Spider lives a neighborhood away and since I live in the country there are fields EVERYWHERE!!!!!!! I didn't want to walk through it but he kept asking. I mainly didn't want to because it's like 100 degrees that day and there no telling the snakes or critters in that field. But, I love him so much I finally agreed and spent over 2 hours, no phone walking through a field that was as tall as I was. After he finished and I left unsatisfied and asked his dad for a ride home. When I got home I called him and started talking to him on the phone but he had mentioned he just got off the phone with his ex. I was really hurt when I found out that he still talked to his ex, and asked if he loved her. I had asked this before we had sex and many times before I sent anything. His answer when I usually asked this was"" I'm over her.""  Spider answered yes and my heart broke. I started crying because it explained why he still had pictures of her on his phone and even mentioned her during sex. Spider mentioned her techniques and what he usually did with her. I told him I couldn't keep doing this if he didn't love me and he claimed he did but loved (let's call the ex the Moon) the Moon more. I was really hurt and hadn't talked to him until school started when I yelled at him to stop telling people we had sex. I found out from some friends that he was telling people about us having sex and even mentioned me walking through the field. Spider even went as far as starting to talk to, or date or maybe they are friends with a girl who doesn't like me and the feeling is mutual. My heart is honestly sad and IDK what to do. I just need advice from someone, because honestly I am hurting. Like is this normal? What should I do? I miss him and Idk can someone please give me advice here?"

I do not do really anything but my position isn't major so I don't think I'm hurting the club. I just wish I've done more. I've organized one small thing and I tried to organize something else and it didn't work out (partly on me but also on someone else). We have elections and this girl is running for my position and wants to meet to talk about it. I said we could but I feel like I'm wasting her time. I don't have much to say and I have advice for ways to improve but still. She's also running for a few other positions and she'd be great in any. 

She messaged me last week and we are supposed to meet Friday. I feel like meeting is a waste of her time because while I don't know what to say but I do know I don't have much to say. I kinda want to lie and message her something came up (NOT last minute, like tonight or tomorrow), and then text her a rundown of the little I do, along with what I'd like to see done and what the person before me said about the position. I probably won't lie but maybe message her and say that I honestly don't have a lot to say. I am overthinking this but I won't lie it's also because I'm guilty for not doing more even though it's a lowkey position (also some shit came up in my personal life after I accepted this position which did affect it). 

What should I do? How do I stop overthinking this?"

I finished my first shift last night and boy howdy my entire body is crying. I‚Äôll get used to the arm and back pain, but my feet are the ones that hurt the most. 
I need advice for shoes, specifically. I wear women‚Äôs size 9w. Cost isn‚Äôt an issue, and I can wear whatever style I want at this job, they can be sneakers, boots, flats, anything, but they need to be wide width. I was suggested adidas nmd‚Äôs but they don‚Äôt come in wide and I‚Äôd rather not risk it since it could possibly cause more discomfort. 
Another few notes I feel like I should add, I feel most of the pain in the balls of my feet, the next most painful part is the heels. I don‚Äôt have much of an arch, but I‚Äôm not extremely flat footed either. I wear flats on a daily basis for my first job and they‚Äôre comfy but I‚Äôm not standing the entire time. The bridge of my feet and my ankles swell pretty often due to having diabetes as well, but not overly so that I can‚Äôt fit into my shoes.
Do you guys have some suggestions that I can take a look at? I‚Äôll even take a look at some shoe inserts if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôd suggest. 
I‚Äôve scoured google, and I got some good ideas but I‚Äôd much rather hear personal experiences. 
If you also have some suggestions on how to alleviate the pain until I actually get the shoes I‚Äôd be more than thankful!"

The other people on my street are sick of it too but no one knows how to get this twit to stop. 

How else can I get ahold of this guy or get this guy to stop? I cannot find an address for him for his company or phone so I do not know how else to get ahold of him and I'm sure if people don't want his junk taped all over their fence they are legally allowed to have this stopped.

The next week i was also waiting and i feel sb  poking me so i thought it was an accident and didn't look back then i felt a hard pull on my bag that i am wearing , i thought it was my friends but i turns out it was jeff he asks me( out of all the people i am standing with ) if i have any questions , quickly i said no  I'll ask the teacher it was weird 
The next week comes and i see jeff and  i ignore him and then while i was speaking with my friends before the class started they noticed that the jeff  was staring at me i didn't look behind me because i found it creepy 

The class ends and again while waiting with my friends (they were explaining sth to me ) he comes and asks if i have any questions  and now i was really creeped out , i said no I'll ask the teacher and turned my back at him there were alot of people standing next to me so why does he always ask me
Then i was asking my teacher and i was the last one( my friends were away while i was asking) then jeff comes up while the teacher is explaining and literally stands really close to us and just stares 
i think the teacher noticed because he then asked me to go and continue the rest of my questions with him i didn't want to and told him i didn't have many questions left so he answered my questions and i left shaking because of how he was looking at me and the gestures he was making my friends noticed them 


Ps ; there are orher assistants there other than jeff and no one did that or asked me out of nowhere i sometimes ask them small questions but i mostly understand fro.m the teacher as he is the one that explains the lesoon and sometimes the assistants don't know the answers and confuse you 
And he is alot older than me which makes it more creepy"
"I work at a homeless shelter, and receive threats from unruly clients who are asked to leave. Am I being too paranoid worrying over my and my coworkers' safety?

It's a great shelter; it gives its clients three meals a day, a warm shower, and a bed to sleep in daily, for free.

Part of my job as shelter supervisor is to ask those who don't follow the rules of the shelter to leave. These rules are not unreasonable; they are things like ""don't do drugs or alcohol while staying here."" A lot of them who break the rules and are asked to leave play the victim, and threaten to stab or kill me or other supervisors.

Our doors are unlocked until evening so technically if they say ""screw it"" and come back with a gun to shoot us up, there's nothing we can do about it in that moment. Yeah, we can call the police, but not while getting shot at, because we work the front desk. If we do call the police, they will arrive within 1 minute or so, but I don't know if that's a deterrent for an unhinged person who wants to ""get back"" at us for asking him to leave.

When I asked my boss what to do if such a thing happens, my boss just replied, ""Oh don't worry about it, that hasn't happened yet.""

I love the job, I love helping these homeless guys get back on their feet, but I have to admit that I'm worried for my and my coworkers' safety. Especially since part of our job description involves kicking people out, some of them see us as enemies, and the front doors are unlocked for any ex-client to just possibly walk through with a weapon in his hand.

Am I being way too paranoid about this? Am I worrying over nothing?"

How to help my (26F) depressed and angry brother (25M)?,Advice,1,die7lg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/die7lg/how_to_help_my_26f_depressed_and_angry_brother_25m/,1,1571201367.0,"My brother has been struggling with depression and anger issues for a while now. Honestly I think it has been simmering for years and years, but he's extremely stubborn and proud. It's like he's missing a spark that makes him passionate about anything, like he's never truly happy but always kind of flat or just content at the most. He's struggled with his self-image for so long, because of our divorced parents and being bullied most of his life. After he snapped this past July he finally decided to seek treatment, though my other brother suspects he's not going to therapy anymore. I know what it's like to be depressed, the last time was last year and that was a really dark time. However, I have always been a very emotional person with highs and lows while my brother keeps his thoughts and feelings to himself and is just flat, empty. I also felt empty during my depressions but I think our ''regular'' personality traits is what makes our depressions so different. I can't hide my emotions well and hate lying; he keeps to himself and then just explodes.

We, my family and I, just don't know how to help him anymore. He wants nothing, can't be motivated or enticed to do anything, evades questions with saying ''I don't know'' or biting people's heads off, or just walks away. He doesn't want to talk. He sleeps until noon, smokes a lot of weed (at least 2 joints a day), he just got fired so he sits at home all day (he got fired over something that was not his fault but it was very ugly and had nothing to do with his depression, he loved his job and feels betrayed and even more angry than normal). He has issues with alcohol though he drinks less now, but a friend of his confided in me he uses more drugs than just weed. When casually asked, my brother denies this. My younger brother suspects he's not even going to therapy, though we have no proof. It's not something I'd put past him.

The question is: how do you help someone like that? I feel that just leaving him alone and only saying that we'll be there would not help. I get that we should give him space and just be there and listen to and support him, but at a certain point, which we are at now, we start feeling like ''just being there'' is not helping him at all or at least enough. It affects my mother greatly as he is always very irritable and she tries her best. For me, it helped that people took me out to do things, get outside. How do we approach this? We'd like to tell him that all we want is for him to get better, that he won't get better if he keeps living life like this, that we'll always be there. How do you say that without making a depressed person feel guilty? We really love him and it hurts so much to see someone you love being so incredibly unhappy and not being able to do anything just kills us."
How do I confront my coworker about his racist microaggression and micro bullying,Advice,1,die65k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/die65k/how_do_i_confront_my_coworker_about_his_racist/,13,1571201199.0,"Hello,

I have a job and this new guy got hired about 6 months ago. I am white but actually grew up as a discriminated linguistic minority from a Metis ethnicity... so Ive experienced discrimination a lot.. and he is Bangladeshi. 

At first we were friends but at some point he just started treating me like shit, I don't know what upset him. It's a very politically tense environment where I'm from (Canada) and I think it's getting to him. He seems to have a very paranoid personality type as well and decided he sees me as a threat for some reason. When I first noticed this is when he offered me Indian food and I refused, and I told him I'd love to try it but I'm a germophobe and everyone in the office had been using the same fork to ""dip in"". I also told him a 3rd world country I lived for a bit once was ""shithole"" and he took really big offense to that. This place was objectively a war torn shithole with emaciated children dying on the street. I shouldn't have said it but I have PTSD from this place and its really hard for me to control my emotions about it.

&#x200B;

Early on I could tell he was bothered by racism and we bonded a bit over mutual stories of discrimination. I could tell he was a bit paranoid about white people so I thought sympathizing with his stories would help put him at ease. I also noticed he was always looking for bad stories about white people (IE: whenever I would tell a story about a jerk, he'd ask if they were white). When I told him I experienced discrimination too to try and bond with him it just became a contest and maybe he interpreted that as me trying to invalidate him.

&#x200B;

Anyway it didn't take long for him to start targeting me. He is always finding an excuse to bring up white privilege but in a really mocking and hostile way. I can't bring up even going to the airport without him being like ""well going to airport is better if your WHITE, unlike me, you should know this."" and etc. He literally does this EVERY TIME WE TALK. He also uses like, primary school bullying as a ""joke"". He's sometimes ripped my lunch out of my hands and saying stuff like ""what would you do if I poured coffee on this"" and I respond angrily that he'd buy me a lunch.. but every time I respond and defend myself he takes this as a slight and his behaviour gets worse. I also have anger management issues (going to a psychologist) so I'm afraid if I do confront him I'd appear too aggressive. This guy is charming and everyone else likes him more than me.

&#x200B;

He is also always saying stuff like ""Celebrating thanksgiving is racist, I don't do it because I'm a Muslim"" which is in and of itself an absolute bonkers statement. He is always going out of his way to casually insert that white people are bad but in a way that isn't direct. Worst thing is when we were friends the worst story of racism he's ever had was someone saying ""what are you looking at""... this guy is privileged as fuck and has rich parents. I literally had to pay my way through uni by working with toxic chemicals without protection at some point and come from a modest background. I made immense sacrifices to get where I am and this guy is always trying to invalidate me. This guy pisses me off so much its hard to explain.

&#x200B;

I work in an extremely liberal area and he has done this in front of many people and no one even cares.. even my close friends. I can't get how they can't see this guy is toxic. It's at the point that I have to avoid my friends at work cause this guy. He is also extremely territorial of women and the attention they give to him (especially white blonds, surprise) he talks to and ups the bullying a lot whenever theres a girl around, probably because he thinks ill steal them from him. Most girls he talks to thinks hes gay and whenever they turn around hes checking them out. 

&#x200B;

I don't want to talk to him 1 on 1. He will just twist my statement and probably start an all out conflict. I want to confront him in front of many people but I don't know how I will do this as he always makes it come off as a ""joke"" and a ""woke statement"" and frankly I come off as a douche.

And on mobile at that. Please go easy on me if I make any mistakes.  It‚Äôs also more like rant to relieve the stress and burden of my situation! I‚Äôve reposted this on many threads already so no need to reply if not wanting to!

I am the youngest child of five, I never grew up wealthy and my parents both have mental illnesses which has created a dysfunctional relation ship with drugs, alcohol and each other. The oldest child is poor, but stable regarding a SO, children, and finances. Doesn‚Äôt have any addictions but switches between hobbies constantly to help it. The second oldest is a single father with empathy issues lives with me and my parents. The second youngest, only 22, not that much older than me, is now severely physically disabled due to a recent illness that has hit him. This has resulted in huge anger issues, constant physical pain, depression, and an over use issue with marijuana and other pain killers. I am as previously stated the youngest, and as a result I am the lightning rod, I have dealt with quite a bit of mental and physical abuse. To the point of even have a case file at my local police station. How ever in the most recent years, my late teens; life has seemed to die down as siblings have moved out for schooling and a new beginning. My mum, a major alcoholic, has retired  from a stressful nursing career and has begun to do self reflection. My father has finally gotten treatment for severe OCD, anger issues, and  personality disorders. But I am still the lightning rod for everyone. 

 Disregarding me, I want to talk about my sister, the middle child. Let‚Äôs call her R. R was a sweet child, she had tons of potential but once she approached Highschool she got sucked in to a horrible friend group. One which abused her kindness, used her body and was mean. This set off some biological trigger that set off a chemical imbalance. It was present in all other family children other than her. She had the family hereditary depression forced on her. That always what the doctors said. Added symptoms include paranoia in our family; we all handled it and have gone through counselling most of our life. She didn‚Äôt. She wasn‚Äôt prepared and with the abuse of her so called friends. She became suicidal and had attempted multiple time by her 16th birthday. But after she got treatment she got better but the scars still lasted. To help those scars my dad would give her tons of weed to help with the pain. It lead to her using alcohol as a crutch when she wasn‚Äôt high all the time. Then she went back to the friends who hurt her. They got into hard drugs and that rubbed off on her. One day though she had an epiphany and went to rehab. It didn‚Äôt work; we thought it did but she lied. A year later, she is now a university graduate and in s stable relationship and owning a house. But on our last visit, we found drug paraphernalia and booze bottle everywhere. Five days later, a call from her boyfriend she hasn‚Äôt gotten out of bed for five days, quit her job, and has only been smoking and drinking. No food no excersize no shower.  She has admitted to drinking nearly empty beers found in dumpsters, picking up used cigarette buds to try and smoke, and when it was all taken a way by her boyfriend (even id and certain phone apps) she even ate coffee grounds in an attempt to get high. It horrible to see. Her boyfriend has sent her home to live with us cause he can‚Äôt handle having to pay the bills, take care of her, go to school and be the subject of her anger. I understand fully why he kicked her out of their house. She‚Äôs in such a rough state it even has caused my heart problems to spike to a bad level. She doesn‚Äôt want to change, but she wants us all to put the effort in any way to help her. Currently my house has all medication locked up and we can‚Äôt even get pain meds without her trying to get to it. 

How can I help her get to rehabilitation again with out causing a fight and how can I support her with out risking me or my family‚Äôs newfound health and stability? 

P.S i am a Highschool senior trying to work and get my life in order for schooling and the real world. And I‚Äôm not trying to be insensitive, I love my sister; I‚Äôm just worried about the effect it will have on my stable but sensitive family.

Ultimately what we need is a fairly basic portable machine that takes reasonable quality pictures and doesn't cost an unreasonable amount."

I'm M22, and I really regret the path I've chosen. Straight out of high school I picked what I was going to study at random, mostly because I had no idea what I wanted to do in life. I don't know what to call it in English, but it involved welding, metallurgy etc.. And after a year chose to go down the maritime path and was on my way to become a ship engineer. 

My grades were decent, but in the back of my mind I always felt like I chose wrong. At the beginning of my last year (6 years of school), I started having trouble sleeping and started coming late to classes. No one in my class or teacher asked how things were doing as things started to deteriorate ( I don't blame them for this at all, I've always kept my thoughts and worries to myself.). Into the last semester I was at my worst, I had stopped going to school and doing homework, I just felt really ashamed by myself. 

I got help from the doctor and got medication for sleeping, but I dropped out. As my grades and absence meant that I couldn't take the exams anyway. I moved back home for the summer and got my sleep pattern alright got a small job washing dishes. I started fresh on the last year in another city due to encouragement from my parents. But I just can't focus on school, I can't find any joy in continuing doing this anymore. I just want to do something else. I just feel like a huge disappointment. Should I maybe take a ""break year"" just doing things I want instead and try find something I can be passionate about?"
My fat fetish is ruining any chance I have of finding happiness with another and I don't know what to do...,Advice,1,diduxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/diduxh/my_fat_fetish_is_ruining_any_chance_i_have_of/,6,1571199973.0,"Please don't hate.

For those curious, I think I'm a feeder--someone who wants to make consenting girls fatter because it turns me on.

Now, please understand that I've tried repressing these sexual desires my entire life. But, I'm a serial monogamist and I always seem to sabotage relationships simply because of this. I've lost women I could have spent the rest of my life with because of my selfishness.

I've tried being honest and upfront in the beginning, but it doesn't seem to work. I thought maybe if I was honest, people would just decide not to be with me from the start and I'd avoid hurting them and myself. But girls don't seem to understand...Sometimes I'll date a girl and they'll indulge me and gain 30lbs or something, but then they'll decide they don't want to be fat anymore and they'll go on a diet and our relationship tanks because they think I resent them and even though I try my hardest not to, I definitely do.

My whole being is a contradiction. I'm active. I'm vegan. I love hiking. I love playing sports. I do want someone to do activities with, but then at the same time, I want a lazy girl who I can bake for and rub her belly and treat her like a fat queen. Despite being vegan, I get turned on by the idea of a girl drinking heavy cream and I just don't know how to deal with myself.

The biggest contradiction is how I feel like I'm a good guy, but I know encouraging a girl to gain weight is unhealthy and yet I'm still extremely aroused by it and always have been.

I know it's weird. I know I'm fucked up. I don't need or want anyone to remind me of this. I'm just trying to figure out how to live a happy life. Trying to understand the best way forward.

I know myself.

Now I'm single again and I've been dating. The thing is, a lot of girls like me. I like to think I'm charming, easy to talk to, seemingly everything a girl might want in a guy, minus this secret.

And I just don't know how to move forward.

I went on a couple dates with this petite girl and we get along so well. I held her in my arms yesterday and she kissed my neck a few times. There was obvious chemistry. She's a backpacker like me. Outgoing, adventurous. Everything I'd like to think I'd want in a woman. She's post doc. So, super smart. My age. Perfect for me if it weren't for the fact that I wish she were curvier.

Then there's another girl. I met her yesterday and she was absolutely stunning to me. Big breasts. Obviously fat. But also beautiful where it matters most. Or where I'd like to think it matters most...She is smart. Sweet. We laugh a lot. Grad student. She described her perfect man and it was me to a key.

I enjoyed both of their company significantly.But I've never actually been with a big girl. I feel like it'd be better to date the girl who is already my type. I don't want to go into a relationship and want to change people. I don't want to be fucked up. But then I worry that she'll lose weight one day and I'll be unattracted to her.

What should I do? How do I erase this fetish from my mind? Sometimes I feel like it's ruining my life. It's just hard. Please no trolls. I need genuine advice..."

I have to justify why and for how long I go to the bathroom, when I fill up my water bottle, if I want to get a coke from the vending machines. I‚Äôm not allowed to be away from my desk, ever, but my department frequently forgets about me and I‚Äôm left with the decision to either face reprimand if I get up for even a minute or two (I have documented proof of this happening), suffer through days with no lunch or breaks at all, or beg for someone to come down and relieve me because they forgot I existed. Because I‚Äôm so scared to leave, I‚Äôve come down with 2 UTI‚Äôs, consistently forego eating, and have started developing a stress reflex of scratching myself until I‚Äôm bleeding because of the stress the job puts me under. I‚Äôve been having severe mental health issues because of this and in the middle of a breakdown I emailed HR to ask what my options were to transfer to another department within the company. 

Today I get an email from compliance stating that they‚Äôre launching an ethics investigation into my claims because I suggested that I was being physically hurt by the job. I feel that this has been misconstrued because no one around me is actually hurting me I‚Äôm just getting into physical distress because of the situation I‚Äôm in. I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôll be ridiculed and judged for bringing this to HR when I just wanted to see what my options were for switching departments. Does anyone have any advice for how to handle this the best way possible?

"My neighbors have been fighting for the past 5 days. The wife may be mentally ill and untreated. What can I do, or what can be done?",Advice,1,didnfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/didnfd/my_neighbors_have_been_fighting_for_the_past_5/,13,1571199129.0,"I have lived in this 6 unit condo complex for 8 months. I transitioned to working from home full time since I moved here. I‚Äôve met a few of our neighbors and exchange pleasantries whenever we‚Äôve passed by each other. However, the neighbors directly next door to me, the ones I share a wall with, don‚Äôt interact much with the rest of us. They appear to be culturally traditional, and keep to themselves. English is their second language. 

Some background details:

The husband: mid-late 50s, balding, slightly rounded belly, and smokes. Whenever he‚Äôs outside, he‚Äôs either smoking or coughing up phlegm. He used to keep me up at night because I could hear him inside his unit coughing late into the night. It seems they also lost their garage clicker recently, because he honks when he needs to get into the garage, which alerts his wife to open the door for him. And I‚Äôm not talking about a polite beep, he‚Äôll lay on the horn. Without knowing him personally, externally he seems like a very gruff person. 

The wife: late 30s/early 40s, fit, and takes care of her appearance. The disparity between the two is somewhat shocking. We‚Äôve spoken briefly when I was working in the garage with the door open. She was bubbly and enthusiastic, very sweet. 

Now onto the dark side of this post. I believe she is mentally ill. Myself and few of the neighbors have seen her pacing in front of our complex for hours. When we‚Äôve approached her to ask if she‚Äôs ok, she says she‚Äôs waiting for someone. The look on her face is very concerned. The police once showed up at my door asking how well I knew them, and if something was ‚Äúoff‚Äù about them. Some of the other neighbors also joined in this conversation, mentioning her pacing and other odd behavior. 

A couple of weeks ago at 2am, the police visited our complex again and spoke with the husband. They asked him if he knew where his wife was. He didn‚Äôt. His wife was at the gas station down the street, pacing around and talking about how people were trying to hack her and were coming after her. They asked him if she‚Äôs mentally unwell and if she‚Äôs on medication or getting treatment. From the officers reactions, the answer was she was not receiving treatment. They then said that because she wasn‚Äôt physically harming herself or others, there was nothing they could do. They said that something was obviously not right with her, and that she needs help. 

That brings us to the past 5 days. There has been loud banging and hammering happening on the shared wall. To the point where I thought for sure I was going to soon get a glimpse into their unit. Plaster crumbling and falling to the ground. They‚Äôre not just hanging pictures. I haven‚Äôt seen any workers or supplies for renovations, so it leads me to believe that while he‚Äôs away at work, she‚Äôs having some sort of breakdown. Then later in the afternoon, there‚Äôs been thumps and bangs on the walls and screaming at each other. Objects being thrown and crashing down along with their yelling. 

I don‚Äôt see them or know them well enough to know if they‚Äôre laying hands on each other. She is clearly mentally unwell and not being treated for it. Whether it‚Äôs her husband not caring about it or her resisting it, I don‚Äôt know. My theory is that because they come from a traditional culture, mental illness is seen as a weakness, and is often not addressed or treated. I know that‚Äôs how it is with some of my more traditional family members. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do, or what I can do here. Does this warrant a call to the police for a wellness check? They have definitely been called before. Any advice is appreciated. I am in California. 


TL;DR Neighbor is having a mental breakdown, and doesn‚Äôt appear to be receiving treatment. Hearing constant fighting, yelling, and loud banging on the walls for the past 5 days. Not sure what I can do here without seeing any evidence."

Work problem,Advice,1,didjcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/didjcb/work_problem/,1,1571198678.0,"Hello,

I have come to ask for some advice because it's getting out of hand and do not know whether i should do something different or not.

I work in a phone retail where we sell contract Sim cards, phones, broadband and other stuff, now as we are all aware everyone has different selling techniques mine has and always been to give the customer what need, wow them or just give them a better price. Since competition is fierce among network providers these days work is becoming more and more how should i put this ""Gray area"". Let me explain there are things we salesmen do to sweeten the deal sometimes it could be as simple as an accessory or something else, but because competition and company money this has become more and more difficult. So my company decided to release new products that are very niche, they are trackers, and i have been trying and have succeeded on multiple occasions to sell a few of them to customer that actually would use them so this is where my need for advice comes. I made a remark to my manager today about lying to customers a thing that i have sworn to never do, trust me i have been burned enough to know better even those white lies, so the whole company has been having a hard time selling these products reason being not a lot of people want them but the big boys on top don't get that and we do not have any managers with balls to tell them the truth in the meetings, so my manager has resorted to what he calls shifting this product which basically means customer comes in asks for phone instead of giving the price for the phone i give him the price with the tracker included and then later tell them that it's part of the package and it's for free and they have to take it. I do not feel like this is a moral thing to do, but we already have two to three members of staff that care so much about money that they have been doing this for a quite a few months now. So should i join them and stop being the good guy or stand my ground even if will probably get me pulled to side and getting told off.

Thanks in advance."
Ignorant stepmother's actions are making me want to move out. Advice is much appreciated.,Advice,1,didjaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/didjaj/ignorant_stepmothers_actions_are_making_me_want/,12,1571198672.0,"This is going to be a seriously long post and I apologize if this discourages anyone from reading. A lot of background information is required for what has contributed to this point in time. Thank you for your consideration. TLDR will be at the bottom, but not helpful.

To start, my father  (M48) has been a trucker since I (M18) have been born. My mother and I were left at home alone six days of the week and I rarely saw him. Within a week of my seventh birthday, my mother and I came home to divorce papers after taking care of my dying great grandmother. There was a serious custody battle and things got messy. We moved states so she could continue her college education that she did not finish in her twenties. I never wanted to visit my dad because he was immature and never paid me any attention. Every time I did visit, he would make crude jokes not fit for an adolescent, would get drunk, and never do anything that I wanted. My mother finally got accepted back into the university when I was nine years old. Late nights of studying became normal and had an effect on our relationship. Since she was now a single parent who was getting screwed out of child support money and going back to school, we were spiraling into poverty. She eventually was diagnosed with cancer and became extremely ill. I remember the many hours I spent in the hospitals waiting on her to get out from chemo and radiation. Fortunately, she beat cancer :) but was then riddled with taking numerous pills to help restore the negative effects of radiation. School became extremely difficult for her and so did taking care of a teenager, as I wanted to be involved in school activities. She tried to commit suicide multiple times, but I was able to convince her to not for awhile. I think that the medications affected her thoughts and behavior severely. During Thanksgiving Break when I was thirteen, I ran away from our home after she pointed a gun at me and said she hated me. A few days later, she committed suicide. After five or so years having little to no communication with my father, he calls me and angrily begs me to move in with him. Long story short, I moved in with my aunt and uncle on my mother's side of the family. They taught me many life lessons and I appreciate them for it. After a few years of living with them, my uncle got into a serious accident rendering him permanently paralyzed from his chest-down. After a year of taking care of him, I decided to move in with my father to give him another chance. My aunt and uncle were okay with this and supported the decision. 

Unfortunately, this decision has seriously turned my life around. My father still trucks and is never home during the day. If he is, he is either sleeping or out shooting guns. When I would visit him, and even now, his new wife gives me weird looks and deliberately tries to ail me. I have confronted my dad and her on these issues before and the answer is always, ""Things will change, I am sorry."" After a year with them, nothing has changed. I buy literally everything for myself. Toiletries, lunch and dinner, my school fees, gas, and anything else you can think of excluding insurance. My stepmother has tried on multiple occasions to get a rise out of me. This past month, we have been out of laundry detergent. Or at least I thought so. My ""parents"" typically buy this, so it has not been an issue. But after month without it, I began to suspect something. As I do my own laundry, I was in desperate need of detergent and got my own. Oddly enough, my stepmother was still able to do her laundry. So one day I walked into their bedroom to get some Qtips and I saw two bags of laundry detergent, and both had been evidently used. Not only am I already paying for the majority of my things, but adding detergent to my list does not help my financial situation. I just turned 18 and nothing was discussed on how things would be paid for in the house concerning myself and that I am still attending high school. I made the choice to graduate a semester early and get out of this town my junior year, but I need to get out now. My stepmother's lies and little actions are getting out of hand and my father thinks it is my fault that these things occur. I honestly think she does not like me because of my deceased mother and that I take her time with my father away sometimes. What else am I supposed to do? I moved here to repair my failing relationship with my father. I have tried to conform to her wants but she is never satisfied enough. Every time she comes home from work, I get serious anxiety from her angry gestures and stomping around the house in disapproval of my living here.

There is a plethora of things that she has done to make me the villain, and I have had the last straw. I have found cheap enough apartments nearby and am considering moving into one of them. I have thought ahead, though. I am sure this would upset my father and the whole side of the family and he would likely take me off of all insurance and any other kind of support. I am definitely leaning toward moving out as soon as I can, but I don't know what I need to do about insurances and other things that adults need to survive in the world. I already have a job, which pays minimum wage and I get all tips. I would easily make enough for the monthly rent, as I make that within two weeks and even more excluding the tips. 

I know that this is a serious decision for such a young age, but I personally think it would benefit my health and help me advance in my life. Can I get any advice on how to be a stable adult? What to do about insurance? Finances? I am in the dark. Although I am already very independent and personally responsible, I feel like that I don't know everything to adulting. Any advice is accepted. Thank you.

Please notify me if I need to clarify anything else. I have only included a few of the issues that my stepmother has spurred, there are plenty more. 

TLDR: My stepmother makes me out to be the villain and has a crazy disdain for me that I cannot comprehend and am about to move out. Need advice on moving out and what to do from there."
Should I take this job?,Advice,1,didip3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/didip3/should_i_take_this_job/,4,1571198612.0,"I graduated from college a couple years ago. I recently quit my first job, and got another job offer. I am pretty much all over the place, and I can't decide what to do with my life, or if I should take this job. 

The job offer is for a well known sales company. These are the pros and cons:

**Pros:** Good money, good sales training, looks good on resume

**Cons:** High pressure- sweat shop like atmosphere, 60+ hour work weeks, I have to move out of state, very high turnover, I have to talk to people on the phone all day, if you don't produce you don't make money, heavily commissioned based, probably short term

I am not super fired up about this job, and I could see myself being miserable. However, I feel that I am backed into a corner, as this is my only job offer, it pays well (in theory), and I am not qualified for much due to short work history, and lack of skills.

On the other hand, I am probably going to do 2 years of online schooling to get a degree to do another job in an unrelated field. And I would like to make as much money as I can in those 2 years. But, it will be difficult to take online courses while working 60+ hours a week.

At what age should someone be allowed to make their own decisions?,Advice,1,didiem,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/didiem/at_what_age_should_someone_be_allowed_to_make/,4,1571198582.0,"The question is worded odd,ly but here's some backstory.

A parental conflict I've noticed is that we believe we're old enough to make our decisions and do as we please given that we're over 18. I know friends who live in dorms who don't have to ask their parents for permission before they do literally... ***anything***, because their parents have no idea what's going on anyway.

So I know this guy for maybe 7 years and I've never thought of him as something more. But then about 6 or 7 months back he asked me out, becouse he said he liked me. I didn't expect it and he is a little smaller than me. 

 We see each other while we're training once a week and it's with bigger group of friend. And we don't hang out normally. I was a little surprised.

The date was great and I had a good feeling about it. But then our friends heard about it and were all the time like ""oh I can imagine your babies, you 'll be so cute together"" and he was saing to them that he felt good about it too, but he told about it everyone he met. After 2 weeks it started creeping me out a little. It was too much too soon. And when he asked me out again I told him I was really busy (I actually was) and maybe later. He said that he gets it, that I don't like him and he won't ask again.

But I notice how he treats me nicely and so I thought it maybe can be something more. But he found a girlfriend, and I'm so happy for him. But well I like him too. And every time we see each other he nudges me or touches my arm and those small things that warm my heart. He never did this before, he started to do this lately. 

I'm such an asshole becouse I can never make up my mind, I know even if he broke up with her I would back off a little. He is better without me. I feel like I am the toxic person here so I should let him be. But I just can't.

I don't want to text her as much I dont smile all that often when we text anymore. When she teases me it doesn't affect me at all. I even struggle to say I love you back, but the worst part is I know for a fact she's still madly in love with me and wants me to be her one. She has done some concerning things when it come to self harm so I'm scared of that as well. She's said before that she wants me around even after we're through I just didnt expect it to be this early. Should I just be direct and be there for her? I dont want to break her heart. 

Some background
She was introduced to our group of friends because she thought my best friend was cute and they dated for about a month. They basically had an online relationship so she left him and started having feelings for me. I was oblivious for about 3 months because I was trying to get with my crush at the time. It didn't work out for me then my friends told me someone liked me and it didnt take lomg for them to just tell who it is. I constantly asked my best friend if it was okay because I thought it was weird and about 4 months after they broke up we started talking. After a month of talking we started dating. We hung out about once a week. One day we went to an amusement park that she wanted me to buy the season pass for. I worked for about 3 weeks to save up money for it because I'm still in school I didnt have much time so it took a while. The day was alright but the next night she broke up with me after I spent $150 and she said she had feelings for my best friend again. I stopped going to the gym and working for a while. Apparently a month after she broke up with me she realized that she missed me and made a huge mistake another month goes by of her hiding it and getting closer to me again because she was still in our group of friends. The truth finally came out. I still hadnt gotten over tbh but I still couldnt say no. Its been 2 months since then, our relationship was great we got so close to each other but I realized I'm just not feeling the same.

I'm (24M) a line cook in an Asian restaurant. I'm still learning my trade, but I know a thing or two. I'm still a bit novice on the grill and flat top. This is where said coworker comes in. He always works this station. Nothing against that. I just really want to learn that. Except coworker feels like he ""owns"" that station. He ""chases me away"" when I try and go over there to learn, mainly belittling me and calling me too stupid to learn it, but also yelling and getting really angry. I've brought this to my chef, and apparently he already knows about this unprofessional behavior. Now I know everyone has their own stuff going on, but like I said, his behavior is very unprofessional. I want to take it higher up in the food chain(no pun intended) but he's been here a number of years and is fairly entrenched.

Should I fight with school?,Advice,1,did8wn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/did8wn/should_i_fight_with_school/,7,1571197533.0,"So I am M18 and I am on highschool. I have this teacher and I will call him X for now. X is very lazy and weird teacher. He don't teach us properly and don't grade us as he should too. For example on our classes he don't tell us what we should know he just give us book and we all take notes of that and he don't say anything just go away and never explain anything. On second subject he teach us we are supposed to make our own project with his help. But again he give us some old projects and we have to copy them. They are often with errors and sometimes total BS so we can't teach anything from that by ourselves. We copy them and then he just compare it to original and accept only work that looks similar so he don't have to do anything. And when we are infront class he just want us to talk about something from book while he is reading that book so he can control us so he don't even know it by himself. He is then grading us not based on points or knowledge but on that how we like us. When I was tested I told him everything about that from his book + what I learned from internet and other books and he gave me C and classmate who is total douchebag but cut trees in his lawn and don't know anything and said like 2 words get B only cuz that. (Also this teacher was making fun of me and it stopped only when principal was involved) Then at end of year we gave him all our work and he saved it in his locker. He gave me D. After some while after closing grades like 3 days before certificate my class teacher (other) told me I have grade F so I had to do resit. That teacher didn't even bothered to tell me he changed my grades. So after investigation with class teacher we was told I didn't have him any projects! I have witnesses. But ok, I asked other teachers how resit works and they told me I get letter with all info. I got letter, but late. In letter was that at date 1-4.7 we have to go to teachers and get projects witch we have to complete. But on letter was official date of writing 2.7 and on post office was date 3.7 posting date so it came 4.7 so no chance for me. So it was administrative error. Date of resit was 23.8 and teachers was supposed to be there for us from 18-22.8 and he wasn't there till 21.8. Then he gave me 3 projects witch each take month and o had only 1,5 days for that. I was doing it even at night and I haven't completed it. On resit everyone was supposed to make little project at that test and present it expect me because I was last tested. They just take look at it and 2 was unfinished and one didn't give any sense (cuz as I stayed he was giving us nonsense projects sometimes). And I couldn't do miniproject or say something. So now I am repeating class. I thing this is unfair and it should be finished. I tought I could send letter to state inspection but dad think it may go wrong because it may shut down school or something so he don't want me to do anything. (And he also think they will hunt me for rest of my life for revenge of my revenge or they will win cuz they use my weakness against me, that I always come late or that I don't know that subject enough we'll cuz he want teaching us, but I am second smartest of class and some dbags came throu only with Es and with minimum hours in school so I am not worst with this) I think he don't want me to do anything because in his times it was different. But seeing every day that smug smiles thinking how they won are really irritating. You thing it's worth it? Also ty for reading :)

Our office is relatively small and our HR department consists of only one employee, a woman who‚Äôs been with the company for decades; she happens to be a close relative of said stinky coworker. I have been with this company for a few months now and the smell only seems to be getting worse on a day-to-day basis. We‚Äôve tried brainstorming how to go about communicating to her that she smells but we have no idea what to say to her. She isn‚Äôt the type of person to be receptive to this type of feedback and being that her relative is in (or more accurately IS) HR, we‚Äôre at an impasse.

However, the youngest one seems constantly out to get me and I just don't understand why. (Shes 14 and I'm 20, but its been like this since she was around 9)

Often, I offer to help her with things. I let her turn the car radio to her favorite channels, things like that. While I've never instigated a fight or tried to provoke her, she constantly insults me and has hit me a few times. Even my other siblings don't understand why she does this to me.

Today, I offered to get her a coffee as long as it was a small (after my lunch I'd have a little under 2 bucks left), which she agreed to. She suddenly argued with me about how I needed to get her the medium that was only 20 cents more, even after I explained to her if I did it wouldn't be enough money left over for my own food. 

This is literally like an everyday occurance to me, my other sister even once asked her why she treats me this way and her response was to ignore the question.

I just want her to not treat me so terribly. Every day I'm called a dozen swears, she's hit me before and freaked when I restained her, and always makes sure to tell the other siblings how much she loves them. One time she ALMOST thanked me for doing something and I could hear her cut herself off from saying it to me, so she's doing it on purpose.

I lost a $100 calculator,Advice,1,dicwb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dicwb8/i_lost_a_100_calculator/,3,1571196147.0,"Okay so I lost this calculator that belongs to my school and this is what I‚Äôve done about it so far: 

- I‚Äôve looked all over my house, my locker and my bag and it‚Äôs not there.

So my solution is to: 
- ask the library at my school 
- ask the mini library at my school 
- go to the janitors office 
- go to the main reception 
(There is no lost and found at my school) 

If it‚Äôs not there, I‚Äôve thought of two things 
- tell the truth but make a sob story out of it 
Like instead of telling my teacher that I was an idiot and lost it, I‚Äôll tell him that I left it at the public library and when I came back for it, it was gone. 

Or I‚Äôll lie and say that I left it in another city I was visiting over the weekend and ask if I can borrow a new one for the time being. My solution from there is to hope that I can keep quiet about it till the end of the school year and just turn it in quietly.

The problem is that the calculator I borrowed is in the system and they‚Äôll know that that one is missing.

She was going to school for a literature degree and she seemed happy with it and so did her friends.

So after switching, I realize I love engineering and I tell my friend how happy I was and how good of a change it was for me. I even told her that sometimes, her major could be done without studying from uni in my opinion. Later, she decided that she wants to be an engineer as well because she started having mixed feelings about her choice of career. 

At first I was happy, but then she started to plan her future out just like I did. and now I‚Äôm worried that she is taking a path I chose because she is lost in what to do and sees my option as a quick guidance for the rest of her life.

I sat down with her and told her I don‚Äôt want her to make this big life decision if she was doing it mainly because she saw me having fun with it. But she told me that the closest thing available to what she really wanted to do was engineering as well. 

I took her word for it but I‚Äôm still concerned because what she says about her new decision most of the time is a rehashed version of what I used to say when I switched my field of study.

I‚Äôm worried she genuinely doesn‚Äôt want to be an engineer but she sees it as a quick answer to a very serious situation. What should I do to make sure this isn‚Äôt a bad decision for her?"

Let's call him dan. I (f) came to the realization that dan, who was my friend for 10+ years, was just trying to get out of me as much as he could. He was my gay best friend, and I honestly would have helped him out with anything. He regularly slept on my couch rent free. I'd buy him food and cigarettes and he'd help tutor and babysit my son. But eventually I started noticing him trying to convince me to do and buy things for him without him actually asking. I started noticing him be manipulative and 2 faced (which honestly I'd noticed beforehand but tried to ignore). Eventually him and I had a falling out.  There's a good dozen or so reasons it happened. I feel like I'm an easy to get a long with person and I dont like to hold grudges and we have mutual friends, so I can get a long with him for a short time in group settings, but I really want nothing to do with him outside of that. Him and my ex (who he'd also had a falling out with) reconciled their friendship, which has made dan contact me more and more. My ex (who is my sons father) has fallen on hard times this past year. He's gotten a couple DUIs and ended up in the hospital due to his own dumb ass mistakes. Dan has been calling me and trying to convince me that I need to take my son away from his father all while pretending to be his friend. Now don't get me wrong, his father is an idiot at times, but he's not a bad guy. My ex is making strides in the right direction in attempt to dig himself out of that hole he's found himself in and I feel like taking his son away from him wouldn't be the best thing to do. Dan has gone as far as to call my sister and speak with her about how I need to do this. He calls and tells me half truths and lies about things that have happened, all while pretending to be a ear for my ex to talk to. I don't like drama, and that is one of the many reasons I cut dan out of my life, but I guess what I'm asking is if I should tell my ex about the things dan is saying behind his back.  I'm not interested in starting drama, which is why I haven't said anything to him. But I feel he should know what his 'friend' is saying about him."

Do I take a job for the experience I need even if pays less?,Advice,1,diceip,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/diceip/do_i_take_a_job_for_the_experience_i_need_even_if/,4,1571194129.0,"Yo. So I work in radio and I graduated college in May with my broadcasting degree. I work at a kickass company that owns some of the most succesful radio stations, like, ever, but I work in promotions, not in programming (on-air). Its a part time gig, pays me 15/hr. During this time iIve gotten to work with and become friends with the very people who got me interested in radio to begin with. Made lots of great friends and made lots of important connections.

Now I've recieved word from a Program Director at a competing company in the same market about my application for a Part Time On-Air gig. I've talked to this company before and I know I would make 12/hr and the commute is twice as long as to my currect job. On the flip side, this new job would be an on-air gig, but I would make less money and have to drive more (more money spent on gas). I also have a second PT gig less than 10 minutes from my house.

What do you think I should do?

EDIT: Forgot to mention, another department (video) is trying to get my hired on as part time help at my current employer. Still only part time, not on air experience, but I love those guys and I‚Äôve worked for them before and enjoyed it."
Don't know whether to continue my studies or not. Currently trying to become a teacher,Advice,1,dice67,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dice67/dont_know_whether_to_continue_my_studies_or_not/,1,1571194092.0,"I am 18 years old and I'm from Germany. About two years ago, my Dad and I decided it would be best for me if I became a teacher. When I talked to my mom about it, we were all very happy with that choice. I felt confident that this was what I wanted to become after graduation. 


Fast forward to today: the semester has just recently started, but I am already feeling very anxious. I'm questioning whether going to university is working for me, and whether I'm up to the task.
I currently feel overwhelmed and at some point even left alone by my university with a lot of things. I'm not sure whether the profession of a business woman would be better for me. This way, I could avoid all the stress and pressure I feel was put on me by my uni. 

I know, however, that my family would be fine with whatever choice I make. 
I'm actually a very independent person, but this is something I feel I need advice on. 

How do I know what I'm passionate for?"
Quit job because not allowed to use leave?,Advice,2,di93t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/di93t2/quit_job_because_not_allowed_to_use_leave/,4,1571180419.0,"I work for an overseas (international) firm. 3 years exp here, 10 total, after a lateral recruitment. I missed my son's birth because they wouldn't give me a wide enough leave window to fly home. Now I would be missing my wife and baby's first xmas and first bday because they wont approve my Christmas leave request.

I have taken 1 sick day since starting and have always had highly commendable reviews, even got promoted 6 months ago. But they don't care whatsoever that I want to be in North America for these major family events. I have unused leave banked, it is just a matter of others taking holiday and they think they need me in the office (i.e. their strong preference, not a real need). I actually suspect they don't want me around so much now that I am prioritizing my family in not working nearly every hour.

I don't have another job lined up. I have a nice chunk of savings (well over a year, even if zero income). I have looked for another job but no luck, I work in a niche field, so it will take me time to land somewhere. My notice period requires I inform them soon if I want to resign for xmas holidays.

There is no HR to speak of. They are puppets for the managers that denied my leave request.

I think this is the final straw, but am I just overvaluing my time with my new family? My wife trusts me to do whatever but of course thinks about my sole income. I am a new dad and missed so much time with my new baby already, we were talking of a March 1 resignation, bc this job is not compatible with a family, but with this, I am tempted to bump up by 2.5 months.

On the way to pick it up he confided in me he and his girlfriend were just recently climbing out from under a lot of debt and fixing up their credit. Then he told me his monthly payment and rate on the Tesla. Not great. 


A few days later I came over and he was like ""you see the new car?"" Girlfriend bought a BMW i3. I also started noticing a lot of smaller purchases like an apple watch, that sort of thing. Now he's asking me to go with him to look at an older Jeep. It gives me anxiety just watching this play out. My car payment is like 1/4 of his.


What's more difficult for me to say something is that I've been very fortunate financially. I had a modest inheritance and I sacrificed basically everything for my career in my late 20s and early 30s. It's not as if I don't have to worry about money, but I'm doing well. I'd feel like an elitist prick telling my friend how to spend his money. At the same time he's expressed in moving up the economic ladder.

I have 3 choices: Film (which I'd enjoy the most), Computer Science (which seems like the most sensible choice) or Art (which I would also enjoy, but seems like a bad decision).**

I have until December to decide what course I'm taking in University and I'm having a hard time figuring out which course i should pick.

The 3 options:

**Film**

This is the course I'd enjoy the most; I love making, writing and directing films and I've made a couple of no-budget films for my A-Levels but i feel like if I'm taking this film career seriously i have to join a Film course because it'll allow me to network and learn the trade. However, I know that joining the Film course isn't necessary and that I could just make a load of films, and build a strong portfolio and try to get recognised and get a job...but this lowers my chances of becoming a filmmaker.

There's also the low chance of me succeeding, I'm super passionate about film and making films, but failure is possible and I might end up in a really bad situation

**Computer Science**

Computer Science seems like the best choice, stability wise. I wouldn't hate the job but i also wouldn't enjoy the job. I'm pretty tech savvy and did once program as a hobby. Comp-sci would also provide much more stability than the other two choices.

**Art**

With Art I could go into lots of varying jobs...VFX, Concept Artist, Graphic Designer to name a few. I'd enjoy art very much but Art is known to be an unstable career path.

Back to this morning. I was coming to my workplace and I saw that L left the chat. I got upset, because I knew that this must be because of me. Every time something happens I don't know about is because I did something that bothered someone but I didn't realize.

I came to my workplace and N was the only one that said hello to me. 15 minutes ago I was checking my phone and I saw that S and N also left the group chat, so I was the only one left.

All my friends from home never want to go out and do something and I wouldn't be able to even if I could, as I have no money. I haven't been able to get a part-time job in 3 years. 

I listen to books on audible, write short stories, listen to a lot of music, play guitar, piano, videogames and little home exercise. I have a lot of hobbies is what I'm saying. But, I don't feel like they bring me joy. I'm constantly bored and I don't know what to do about it.

Well, that's not entirely true. Alcohol definately gets rid of the boredom. I spend a lot of the money I do get on alcohol, just to have a little fun for a couple hours. I throw parties as an excuse to get REALLY drunk and so that I can see my friends who are always working. I don't think I'm an alcoholic but at this rate.

I have a brother (19 y/o) who accuses me (26 y/o) of not spending enough time with him. We were never really close during our lives, since i‚Äôm 7 years older than him, had a different lifestyle and was on antidepressant for half of my life. I‚Äôm not good at talking, I have very few friends, I‚Äôm very shy and quite a loner. 

He accuses me of ruining his life because when I was in high school I ignored him. While I really didn‚Äôt spent much time with him during that period of time, i was: 1) young and stupid 2) depressed. This doesn‚Äôt mean that we didn‚Äôt speak to each other, we watched videos on YouTube and anime together. For him this wasn‚Äôt enough. 

Now he is angry at me because I‚Äôm older and we‚Äôre not close to each other. I understand his frustration, but him being angry for not including him when i‚Äôm with my boyfriend is too much. And sometimes he wants to be included in my circle of friends. 
I understand that he wants my attention, and sometimes we do talk together, but screaming at me that I ruined his life is really unbearable. I try sometimes to spend time with him, I admit that it isn‚Äôt much, but I don‚Äôt completely ignore him. We have very different personalities, which don‚Äôt help. 
He is so passive-aggressive that I can‚Äôt stand him anymore. My friends think that he‚Äôs immature and he shouldn‚Äôt accuse me over a situation that is quite normal between siblings. 

The way I treated my brother is the same way I act around my whole family, tbh. I love them, I spend time with them but I‚Äôm honestly not too close, I guess because of my personality. 

I don‚Äôt know what to think. I just need an unbiased opinion on the situation, because the way he‚Äôs talking to me is making me rethink about everything in my life.

Anyway we sort of both blocked each other and haven't spoken since.

Anyway me and my mates were talking about the past couple of years and since then I've been thinking and I do miss our friendship. I don't like her in that way any more and have no intention of trying it on. However I really want to talk and just settle it out as I was a little bit of an a hole.

I've unblocked her but she hasn't accepted me back on anything so I can't just text her. She still uses public transport and I often drive past her so the only way I can think about talking is by literally stopping and talking to her or giving her a lift home.

Problem is I don't want to make her feel awkward, after all we ain't spoke in a year and a half.

Is there any way I should approach this or do I just leave it and get on with my life?

Looking for polite but effective way to tell family boyfriend that politics talk during holidays isn't welcome,Advice,2,di8blw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/di8blw/looking_for_polite_but_effective_way_to_tell/,8,1571176851.0,"Hi r/Advice! First post here, I hope I'm doing this correctly.

It was Thanksgiving and Canada this weekend and my sister-in-law's 20-something boyfriend came to visit for the weekend. He's fairly new to the family dynamic but he's been around long enough that I want to ask for advice on how to nip this topic in the bud before I pop my top and cause a bigger scene at the dinner table.

We're a ""small L"" liberal family (several 30-something adults) and he is clearly‚Ä¶ not. I don't presume to change his life outlook or political beliefs and I intentionally avoid the topic so he's not encouraged to follow suit. I just want him to not preach during table conversation or TV time.

For context, a few topics I consider inappropriate for Thanksgiving discussion included:

* a corporation's ""duty"" to make revenue at cost to human life or safety
* how Donald Trump and his team are being set up on all sides and prevented from doing his job
* handgun assembly and the differences in stopping/killing power between models
* one-upping vacation plans, fancy meal tales or big ticket purchase news with his own life experiences he's received via his family finances (he enjoys Dad's money, living well above his own means as a student)
* (worst IMO) telling an inappropriate story about a dead person when he was previously informed another family member suffered a recent loss

I dunno if this is a misguided attempt to relate to the family, an intentional stirring of the pot to annoy ""teh libruls"" or just the typical self-involved 20-something most of us were at that age. I'd just like to find a way to be the bigger person and getting this type of behaviour to stop without alienating him or my sister-in-law. 

So erm, how about that advice? :)"
"I'm at a crossroads in my life, and really need some help regarding my future career",Advice,1,dibdpp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dibdpp/im_at_a_crossroads_in_my_life_and_really_need/,2,1571189926.0,"I'll try to keep this short.

I graduated roughly two years ago with a Masters degree in ancient history, a subject with bleak employment opportunities, and one that I have since fallen out of love with. For the most part, the two years since graduation have been spent unemployed, which has taken a significant toll on my mental health.

I have finally admitted to myself that it's time to suck it up, and go back to school to get an actual degree that isn't useless. However, I'm torn between two different paths.

On one hand, I've considered going into teaching. I'm from Canada, so teachers actually get paid very well, and have some of the best benefits in the world unlike those south of the border. Summers off are also very attractive to me. During my M.A. I did teaching assistant work, and felt I did a fairly good job. The main issue is I'd have to go back for two more years of schooling (the school is a 15 minute drive from my house, however so I could easily commute), and after that I'd be put on a supply list and work my way up. I've heard some people say it could take years before I land a permanent teaching position, which frightens me. Both my parents are teachers, however, and would offer to help me in any way they could.  

The second option I've been considering is going into copywriting. There is a pretty reputable program somewhat close to me (a lot farther than the teachers college. Commuting would be possible, but a lot more stressful) which teaches copywriting, helps to build a portfolio, and offers internship opportunities. This program is only one year in length. I do like the creative aspect of copywriting, and feel it's something I could potentially do well in. However, copywriter salaries pale in comparison to teaching, and it's an industry that is a lot more foreign to me. 

At this point I'm torn in the middle between the two: Teaching is something I'm familiar with, the pay and benefits are incredible, but I would potentially have to spend years fighting my way to a permanent position. Whereas copywriting is a foreign industry to me, the pay isn't as good, but I'd be finished the program in half the time, and given an internship, which could realistically lead to permanent employment significantly quicker than teaching would.

Sorry for the long post, but if you guys could give me your thoughts, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks so much."
my cousin (16f) is caught in a pyramid scheme and wont quit bc she thinks its legit given that her boyfriend (18) is in it and doen for it 100%. how do i convince her that she should quit?,Advice,1,dibcyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dibcyu/my_cousin_16f_is_caught_in_a_pyramid_scheme_and/,3,1571189840.0,"so foreword: this will kind of be a long post and ive posted this similarly to another subreddit. i decided to post here too since im hoping to get some advice and knowledge (if anyone knows how it works) on the situation

some background: a cousin of mine (16f) is working at PHP agency (its an MLM that sells life insurance to people but relies most on recruiting people to work). apparently she was asked to come in at 15 y/o but did not start working until 16. she works about 3-4 weekdays after school and sometimes past curfew (10-12am) im pretty sure she was recruited by her 18 y/o boyfriend (since you get in by recruitment?) she also mentioned that all she does is paperwork for her boyfriend, and that she directs buyers to her boyfriend after they fill out some sort of paper work. so while shes not doing anything illegal like selling life insurance at 16 the way she gets ‚Äúcompensated‚Äù is sketch

she says she gets compensated for her work, but because she is underage she can only receive the money in some college funds account that has been set up for her. supposedly she has around $3k saved up (not through any legitimate bank im aware of either since she does not own any sort of debit card). she says that she has yet to pull money out of the account given that she is not 18 yet, but her boyfriend has taken out money for her before when her mom needed it to pay bills (note: apparently if money is withdrawn from her account her mother is notified. so when i asked her to pull out her $3k that she claimed she had she said that she could not since her mother would be notified. another thing is that apprently her mom knows she works there and lets her work there, but i believe she is unaware of the fact that its a pyramid scheme) ive never heard of a ‚Äúcollege funds account‚Äù so im pretty skeptical its even a thing.

ive confronted her about how PHP is a scam and how no place that makes you train asks for a fee, but she is reluctant to believe me as her boyfriend is in it deep and believes that by telling him its a scam will make her a bad girlfriend for not wanting him to follow his ‚Äúdreams‚Äù. so my question is, considering that she is probably not getting paid through a ‚Äúcollege funds account‚Äù how do i convince her that shes being played and that she should quit her ‚Äújob‚Äù and that in the long run this would not be worth it since its a ‚Äúcareer‚Äù that relies on paying training fees for her to get in and be successful? last thing, confronting her mom is not really a choice given that my whole family‚Äîaunts and uncles included avoid confronting each other about each of their kids problems as it would be seen as telling someone how to raise their kid. however she is my cousin and id like warn her before it gets worse and shes spending all these training fees.

tldr; my 16 y/o cousin works as some receptionist/assistant for her boyfriend at PHP agency. she says shes getting paid by them putting money into some college fund account thats been made for her since she is underage. what should i do to make her realize shes being scammed and used so she quits?

Teenager issue and travel.,Advice,1,dib7ei,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dib7ei/teenager_issue_and_travel/,1,1571189212.0," Guys I seriously need some advices for my current life. 

I am a 5'8  Asian man, 18.8 years old, planning to go study at Finland next year.

My problem is that I am technically a virgin with very few social experiences.

And I crave to have some changes. I hate being like such a misery.

&#x200B;

  I live in a Far East Asian country where people are rather conservative, un-westernized, usually don't social that 

much and also not that open about sexual topic let alone casual sex, which basically barely happened.

Furthermore, growing up I've only known ""4"" of my guy classmates who has girlfriend. (I always being like a ""Swissland"" in my class, every friend group of people would always included me, so I know who has girlfriend or not for sure).

Maybe it's just me being super lucky. But that really makes me, a man, quite inexperienced of interact with opposite sex, 

vice versa for many female peers at my age.

What even worse is that I did home-study for like an entire semester of my last year in high school.

Which means it has been almost a whole year of me without being into any sorts of group of people.

&#x200B;

  Throughout the time being alone (I occasionally go to school and do some sports with my bros),

I have gradually adapted quite a disciplined life style; I try things like meditation, no fap, cold shower, working out, reading books everyday, learning many new things etc.

As long as I became more into all these things, it became more gross that I don't fit in any of friend groups no more. 

I share less and less interests, mindsets with any of my friends. 

On top of that I don't use social media, the further I went apart from my ""society"", I live more comfortable but isolated 

and empty.

  It's still a very lengthy period of time before going to Finland, like 9 months or so. So I want to change, to improve, to go 

through some challenge that can get me out of this shitty situation of no friends, no social experiences, never kissed a 

girl of my same age. I am considering to travel, but I want to avoid to use my parents' money because I think that is 

shameful for me; I feel like I have been owe them too much, they are so supportive, gave so much love and being so 

understanding that made me such a healthy person and know how to think, be polite.  

But I still want to travel so bad. I've in reality only talked to a few people from different continents. 

So where should I go? I have been learning Portuguese so Brazil?

But it will be more adventurous if I go to places like Ethiopia, Sudan, which have been on my travel list for so long.

Or even go to Sates? Estonia, Georgia, Poland? 

Which one should I go first? Where I will probably deal with less racist-discrimination and be more capable to interact 

with people?  I really need advice.

My whole life I was always quite good in school. I graduated from the best high school in my country and went straight to uni where I started studying linguistics and middle eastern studies. I will graduate soon and my grades are really really good. 
I chose these two subjects because I was interested in them but I was only 18 back then and didn't really think about the future. I'm very passionate about linguistics, it fascinates me and as if now I speak 5 languages but I'd like to learn some more in the near future. 

However, lately I started to question my choices. I feel like I'm not going anywhere with my career at the moment. I have 3 part time jobs, I'm employed as an ESL teacher, I'm a waitress and I work for a call centre. But I don't really know what I want to do once I graduate. I always wanted to become successful and make a decent wage but I feel like this might be hard with linguistics. 

On top of that my little sister is very successful with her jobs. After high school she decided to do 2 one year long internships
She was excellent in both and both companies wanted to hire her on the spot. She will start her studies in economics next year. 
The same goes for my boyfriend. He travelled and worked after high school until he figured out what he wanted to study ad he will start an economic degree next year as well. Both of them seem to have solid plans for the future and they seem to be set up for a lot of money and success. 

I, on the other hand, am unsure of what to do. I do really enjoy what I study but I can't help but feel like I should have chosen another path like law or medicine. I never used to feel like that but this feeling appeared out of nowhere a few months ago and has been getting stronger since. 
I don't know what to do. It's to late to change my course as I'm almost done with it and I do really like linguistics but I'm scared I'll end up working at a library or a museum (no offense to people who do that I think it's a cool job just not the right one for me)
What should I do?

Tldr: I study linguistics and really like it but I have the nagging feeling that I won't be successful later and that I should have studied law or economics or something like that."

I'm a student at a high school in Australia, where we lack middle school and it is included into the package of high school, lasting grades 7-12. For my own privacy, I will not be stating my age or state/area of residence. 

For a while now, I've been having these odd sessions where i suddenly become tired, zone out but am somehow still conscious and forget where I am, what time it is and what I should be doing. This usually happens when I'm in bed on my laptop in the afternoon after studying when I reward myself with some quality YouTube. I simply close my eyes unknowingly, turn my head while still having a light grip on my laptop and rest. it's a bit like when you're up late about to go to sleep and it's so easy, but also with the same effect with when you're trying to sleep while being fully energetic, where it takes a full 2-5 minutes of being conscious to fully go to sleep. I lie in the middle of these two descriptions. It's so easy to fall asleep, yet I'm somewhat  conscious? Often I'll wake up about 10 seconds to 5 minutes later either not knowing where I am for a second then remembering or instead of having no idea, thinking I'm somewhere completely different at a different time meant to be doing a different thing. This doesn't happen too often, but has happened 3 times today which is beginning to concern me, as it has never happened so many times in a day and I asked my mum, I had woken up an hour later. that's one of the latest it's ever been.

Some of you may brush this off as simply resting. I, however, find it to be worse than that. 

I sleep a full 8 hours minimum every night, going to sleep at usually around 9-10 pm, and waking up at 6-7 am, so I have a pretty good sleep schedule for my current state. I simply do not feel just tired, I feel like what I'm doing is right, I just go with the flow. This happened 9 times consecutively once in class, and that was the first time in all of my schooling I had ever come near to falling asleep in school before that day. My friends had attempted to wake me, but I had not budged according to them. 

another example of this happening is this afternoon. Once again, I was in bed enjoying some nice YouTube, laptop in hand and earphones in, and suddenly i close my eyes and collapse. I awake what seemed to be 10 seconds but honestly felt like much longer than it should have. When I awoke, (it was around 4 pm), I had been under the impression it was late night, I was watching YouTube and had lost track of time and was going to sleep. Keep in mind this is when I had woken up. I opened my eyes, blinked, and had immediately realized what had happened. 

When I have these, let's call them ""episodes,"" I seem to forget something vital for me to remember what had happened fully, and that thing can vary from what I had been doing previously to even the entire day so far.

I thank you for reading this far if you have. 

My asking for advice is this;

can anybody, with experience or not, give me any remote explanation as to what this might be and/or what could help calm this down?

TLDR: I fall asleep randomly and awake with short-term temporary amnesia lasting from 10 seconds to 5 minutes.

Thanks for any help, it is highly appreciated!

I lied about my age and now I'm in a long term relationship lol,Advice,1,dib2pb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dib2pb/i_lied_about_my_age_and_now_im_in_a_long_term/,7,1571188687.0,"lol hi y'all here's the thing: I met my bf 3 years ago on tinder and we spent \~nine (9) months to a year hooking up before we started exclusively dating. during that time he was 22 and I was 19, but my tinder profile said I was 20. somehow my age never came up so I never thought about correcting it, but during our first year of dating my bf mentioned how he thought a two (2) year age gap was weird but he liked me so it was ok. I was 20 and he was 23 but he thought I was 21.

that SPOOKED me and I decided just to stay quiet about the fact that our age gap is three (3) years b/c I assumed we wouldn't be dating that long lol. 

FAST FORWARD: a bitch has been in a relationship for a minute (I'm 22 and he's 25 but he thinks I'm 23) and we are moving in together. we've been on planes together and left the country together and we talk about marriage but he STILL THINKS I'M A YEAR OLDER THAN I AM BUT IDK HOW TO TELL HIM BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN S O L O N G. on birthdays I'll just kinda nod and agree when he says we're celebrating my \_\_\_ birthday. I don't know how to come clean.

tl;dr three years ago I told my boyfriend I was a year older than I am bc I didn't think we'd date this long but we did and now I don't know how to come clean"
Should I leave my boyfriend?,Advice,1,dib2i9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dib2i9/should_i_leave_my_boyfriend/,3,1571188662.0,"I love my partner and he is great and usually treat me well. But I can‚Äôt help but think we aren‚Äôt compatible nowadays. We‚Äôre very different and we have used it to our benefit before. But I always feel like I am boring him. I try to talk to him about various things such as TV shows we watch, a podcast I listen to (he got me into the podcast), my day at work, books I am reading, my goals for the future, cool new recipes and health tips, and try to show him how to stretch (his back always hurts). I‚Äôm a very relational person who cares about health. I‚Äôm very fit and enjoy cooking healthy and eating healthy. 

On the other hand, my partner is overweight, drinks daily, smokes daily, plays video games till five am (on days he works even), and loves fantasy things. I try to share my interests with him and have light conversation after we get home from work but he seems to not hear me and won‚Äôt respond to what I say unless I get upset with him and repeat myself louder and ask if he can hear me. 

He regularly plays video games and I ask him if I can join or if we can play a game we can do together while I am over and he says you can watch me play this game and tell me what to do! So I try to do that and he disregards everything I am saying and doesn‚Äôt even acknowledge me when I talk about his game with him, so I end up reading. I try to tell him some fascinating things that happened in my books (about the holocaust, corruption, segregation, other political/moral issues) and he doesn‚Äôt respond. 

In addition, he only initiates sex with me once a week. I am turned off by him because he has gained lots of weight so I don‚Äôt initiate. I never tell him anything negative about his appearance because I am afraid to hurt him but I dearly wish he was active and fit like me. He never compliments my body and hardly touches me. I feel unwanted and unloved. I get more stares from strangers than I get from him. 

He knows he annoys me when he plays his game and apologizes after the fact. I am so turned off that I am dating someone who finds multiple fantasy games more exciting than me. He act like a child on Christmas when he unlocks an achievement but can‚Äôt even get excited at the prospect of actually doing the things he does in games like hike, scuba dive, ski, etc. I love doing those things in real life but he can‚Äôt afford to go so instead I go alone. 

I feel like he doesn‚Äôt even like me that much if he does something he knows annoys me but can‚Äôt stop, like how he can‚Äôt stop drinking and smoking. I don‚Äôt understand why he treat me like he loves me and appreciates me. He gets more excited over a game than being with me or doing things with me."

I‚Äôm worried my friend might be in an abusive relationship,Advice,1,diazpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/diazpn/im_worried_my_friend_might_be_in_an_abusive/,1,1571188350.0,"My friend has been dating this guy for 3 years. Very early on in the relationship she expressed insecurity about it, one time saying that she had to ‚Äúlook in the mirror and convince herself she loves him‚Äù which was the first red flag I saw. Then as time went on they continued to have all sorts of problems. Sparing the details he was neglectful, uncaring, unfaithful, manipulative, etc. When my friend would come crying I would of course tell her that maybe it‚Äôs not a healthy relationship but she kept saying that she is fixing him and that they‚Äôre working on things. Eventually I just told her to stop telling me about their problems if she wasn‚Äôt really gonna take any advice.

I thought their problems didn‚Äôt go any deeper than the typical unfaithful boyfriend stuff, but there‚Äôs been a couple times where she was very panicked saying she ‚Äúneeds to get away from him‚Äù and ‚Äúwants to kill herself‚Äù.  In both instances the police were called (once by me, once by someone else), but by the time they arrived to their place everything was normal and she insisted there was absolutely nothing wrong so the police just left. When I asked her if she was being abused by her boyfriend she again insisted that he wasn‚Äôt, but her reaction wasn‚Äôt normal. I feel like if nothing was wrong she would have been more surprised that I would ask her that or even gotten angry that I would say that about her boyfriend, but she didn‚Äôt. She also has a history of abuse in her own family, one of her relatives was abused by her husband for a very long time but it was kept secret for years and years. I see a lot parallels between that situation and hers, so I fear that she is also hiding things from us. I don‚Äôt really know how to help her and I might even be entirely wrong. I have even heard that you shouldn‚Äôt tell an abuse victim to flee from their abuser because it can cause things to escalate very quickly that‚Äôs often how the abuse victims end up being injured or killed."

recently we have actually been hanging out, spending time together and developing a friendship. i‚Äôve noticed that she has become less and less clean the closer we become. she never does her dishes or cleans up after herself. she expects me to take out the garbage and she even asked me to do her laundry for her one day. 

i want to get along with her and for us to have a nice relationship so i‚Äôm really conflicted on if i‚Äôm just being obsessive/overthinking or is she actually using my liking towards her as a way to manipulate me into doing all the housework?

any advice on how to proceed would be appreciated!"

Waves of Anxiety‚ÄîCan‚Äôt Sleep,Advice,1,dian22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dian22/waves_of_anxietycant_sleep/,8,1571186934.0,"About a month ago, my (28f) wife (38f) had a good discussion where it was revealed that she ‚Äúself-loved‚Äù and watched porn a few times without me knowing...in attempts to increase her sex-drive. I generally have a higher drive and she thought watching porn and masturbating might increase her desire. At the time, I was shocked and almost a little hurt because she and I (7 years ago) kind of agreed to not self-love and to look toward each other for sexual pleasure. So when she told me about these instances, I tried to be understanding and ‚Äúcool‚Äù about it but I was a little confused and hurt. 

After the conversation, things were good, we had awesome sex, and everything seemed fine. Then suddenly, I began becoming increasing more anxious about what she had told me. Every time she‚Äôs on her phone at night, I began to create stories of her on porn sites or sexting random people. I know this sounds insane because she‚Äôs incredible and I know she‚Äôd never cheat on me. I think part of this stems from my childhood, my mom was cheated on by my father and I just assume that‚Äôs going to happen to me. 

I brought up my concerns to my wife in a not so great way, when my anxiety was at its all time high. This was not ok on my part. I basically peeked at her phone around her shoulder while laying in bed and asked if she‚Äôs masturbating. She was playing a stupid game and was not masturbating... so of course I looked like an ass and she was upset that I didn‚Äôt trust her.

Now I‚Äôm not able to sleep. It‚Äôs been 3 three weeks of sleeping about 2 hours when my wife is doing work in bed watching tv, then waking up when she turns off the tv and plays on her phone until she falls asleep. I don‚Äôt fall back asleep until her phone is down and she‚Äôs snoring.... so I‚Äôve been getting like 4 hrs of sleep.  It‚Äôs horrible. I feel terrible that I don‚Äôt trust her because I feel like I do... but this anxiety is driving me nuts!!!

I feel like I can‚Äôt bring it up with her again because of her reaction last time and I told her I‚Äôd move on. Well I clearly haven‚Äôt!! 

Any advice on how to get over this??"

Working with someone who was fired from ex organization due to sexual harassment,Advice,1,diak39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/diak39/working_with_someone_who_was_fired_from_ex/,16,1571186593.0,"Hey Everyone

Using a throwaway account because I am very new in the company.

I recently joined a company that offered me my dream role.

I was working very closely with a man. He is very intelligent, sharp, helpful and one of the top performers.

He had previously worked in two organizations where my friends had worked as well.

I casually asked Friend one about him on the note of if she knew him.

She told me he was fired from that organization on multiple accounts on sexual misconducts and there were many cases reported. Due to this he was asked to just leave one day without any notice.

Then I texted the other friend and asked him who legit described him as a pervert and recounted a few incidents that happened at that workplace. Although that man left that workplace to join my current company.


My current company is a very well known global company which says it has zero tolerance for sexual harassment.

So, firstly should I just report this to the HR just as a piece of information that I have? 

My concern is that he's been with this organization for a year. And if he was the same guy someone would have spoken. I'm also guessing this would have come up in his background check.

I'm afraid if I don't report this and something happens I'll be told that I had that information but I sat on it. The other fear is what if he has genuinely changed and I might just ruin his career and progress.

Major fact- He is now working with our team very closely which is a all women team aged between 25-30

TLDR- My colleague was fired from ex organization for sexual harassment. Should I report that to HR? No incidents have happened as of now."

Anyway, before he got the job he let the hiring manager know that he has a past injury from the military from years ago. He still got the job, but after a month he got hurt while pushing carts, same arm he hurt in the military. We went to the ER the same night after he got sent home early. He has a sling now and is waiting to hear back from the doctors. 

He went back to work today, even after he got a note saying don't lift, push, pull or do anything with his arm, He talked with a higher up about things and she told him shes not going to say anything or do anything about doing light duty because this was already a prior injury. She is upset with him because he ""is claiming a prior injury as a work injury"" which isn't the case at all. It just shows how she won't let Sam's club cover a injury that happened there, at Sam's club, while he was working. Now in my opinion I feel she is in the wrong, they hired him knowing he had a prior injury from years ago, he worked doing the same thing for almost a year at home Depot, and was perfectly fine, his arm still worked fine and he knew his limits. I feel like this may be military discrimination, but I'm not totally sure. But on the other hand I don't know alot of stuff about this type of situation, so I have no sure idea who is in the wrong in the situation.

I am now 26 next month and we are no longer together, and I am living in a 4 bedroom house all by myself. It definitely gets lonely. It's been about 6 months that we've been broken up. Another big change in my life is that I quit my job 2 months ago due to toxic leadership. I plan on going back to school in January, and off of my army disability money and the gi bill money I will receive, I can definitely pay all of my bills and make it by just fine in the house while doing my normal leisures. But that wouldnt leave me with a whole lot of money to travel or do anything extraordinary. I've thought about getting roommates, but I don't really have anyone I can trust enough to pay me on time, to keep the house clean like I like it, and to be considerate when it comes to noise. So that was the huge build up to the question of ""should I move back in with my parents while going to school and rent out my house?"" It would definitely free up most of my money so I could do pretty much anything I want in the off semesters and things like that. But at the same time, I do enjoy having my personal space and having a spot my friends or a girl can come over to that isnt awkward. I guess Id also just feel weird moving back in with my parents at 26, but financially it would be nice. What are your thoughts?"

That's fine but that means I haven't been in the store in 2 weeks so I texted my manager and asked when I would be working next. I'm told ""it's posted on the wall"". Okay well I didn't even know this wall existed I haven't even been trained yet and he's at the store and I didn't demand he tell me immediately just when he had a minute. (I asked 3 days prior and have been very busy with college and had no time to drive all the way to the store)

So instead of just helping me out I have to drive to the store today only to find out I work this afternoon when I've already made plans. Should I just say fuck it and not show up? I'm not even scheduled for the next 2 weeks.


Could this permanently damage my ability to be hired in the future even if I dont list Spirit Halloween as past work experience?"

She wanted me to get involved because she wanted to add an LGBT chapter, since I am Asexual I joined to help her with the club hoping I can educate people on the LGBT community.

And the club has been going for 3 months and we haven't talked about any LGBT things, and the rest of the club is not interesting to me. I'm dreading going to each club meeting. 

On top of this I'm also in 2 other clubs that I LOVE (karate and art club) but my curriculum is so packed I hardly have time to go to the clubs I want. I need to quit this club because it isn't interesting, we haven't talked about the LGBT community like she promised, and I don't have time for this club!

Struggling after an accident,Advice,1,dia3qc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dia3qc/struggling_after_an_accident/,1,1571184702.0,"Hey y'all, sorry it's kinda long. Thanks for listening and for all advice.

(p.s. I've edited this post as it keeps getting removed even though the advice I'm seeking doesnt break the rules)

I'm trying to decide at where to begin... I suppose it can start with me wanting to quit my job. I've never really been a big fan of it. There are good days, but there are a lot of bad days. They're mostly due things constantly breaking (internet going down, phone server breaking/hacked, flooding, ect), there's no consistency and it fucks with my mental health. Anyways, I had made the ultimate decision back in July that a vacation in August I would look for a new job and do part time so I can work on my passion projects as I am an artist. The hope was to have a new job by mid to late September and finally find a little peace.

Well, unfortunately on my vacation I broke something. It's honestly not that bad of a break, doesnt really hurt or bother me even though my mobility has been greatly reduced. I tried to remain in a chipper mood cause it could have been waaaay worse. As the weeks gone by my mood has slowly declined and I've become more depressed, maybe its due to the seasonal change I'm not sure. I had my hopes up, that the break would be healed enough so that I would be told I could start walking again at my follow-up appointment. Unfortunately again, Broken Body Part Person told me that the break had actually gotten worse and suggested a procedure. Basically I can be up and walking again in 4 weeks with a procedure, or go through possibly 8 more weeks with crutches and risk nonunion.

I was leaning toward doing the procedure, until a coworker said that it should be a last resort. She had broken something years ago and had procedure early on and had multiple complications from it. While I know not everyone has the same experience, I took her words to heart as I'm fairly a fairly active person and I miss being able to walk (seriously not being able to go outside to enjoy fall/go on runs/doing anything besides sitting at home has been torture). Anyways I had gotten a call yesterday from the Broken Parts office, as I was still curious about the cost of procedure in case I chose to do it, or if it didnt heal right. The cost to have it done would be $5000.

I am struggling to comprehend any of this, my happy plan to move on from this work place is a thing of the past now. A door that slammed shut and sealed tight that was at an end of a hallway, now I have to find a new way out. I feel trapped in this job until my break is healed enough that I no longer need my insurance. If I have to get the procedure, then I'm trapped in this stupid job for at least another year until my expenses have been paid off. I hate that I feel like I'm losing my sanity over this. I hate that it feels like every week that I'm trying to get through this, something else brings me down more...

I guess what I'm looking for is advice from anyone that has had an accident that caused a struggle for them.  Is there words of encouragement that someone would like to give me to help me put my struggle into a better perspective so that I can possibly see it in a better light?

Again, thanks for listening, sorry its a wall of text/if there are grammatical errors as I'm kinda emotional typing this out as thoughts come to mind.

TLDR; Wanted to quit my job, broke something on vacation. I feel trapped, helpless, and I feel like I cant find a way out."

When I say it sounds like a stampede of elephants sprinting around, I wish I was exaggerating (for reference their dog is not small, they have a sturdy, large pit bull). It‚Äôs not a spurt of noise either - it‚Äôs a consistent stomp/ pound noise and the dog has the zoomies (burst of energy spurts where he sprints around the floor) for like an hour. The  walls are incredibly thin - thin to the point we can hear their arguments and conversations like we are in the room with them and the floors are wooden so having the large dogs nails scrape on the floor 24/7 is just an added bonus. This is our second year in this apparent and the tenants before they moved in we rarely heard so this is definitely a them issue. If we had known these people were moving in, especially with a dog, we wouldn‚Äôt have resigned. I‚Äôm not sure how we should confront our neighbors or our landlord. This has been an issue since day 1, but it‚Äôs gotten so bad as to not being able to get a decent rest because of the stomping (I am convinced they have led feet). I‚Äôm about to lose it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

I wanted this move to be my ""breakout"" as it were, as there's a huge night life scene in the city, but it didn't go that way. Within 48 hours of our first texts we had already slept together and we've been together for over a year now. I'd always felt an apprehension around being with her, mainly that physically she wasn't my type (she's always fluttered around 200 pounds and most of the girls I've been interested in before could not inaccurately be described as beanpoles), but also I could feel this ""pull"", I guess. 

Her previous relationship had failed because in her words, ""she cared more about the other person than they did for her"", and I'm terrified that this is the case in this relationship too. She said that she could see herself marrying me after only 3 months, and honestly I could really see myself being with her for a long time.

I love her, but I don't know if I love her as much as she loves me. She and I get along so so well, often our jokes can be had with nothing more than a glance, because we both notice and think the same things at the same time. Our chemistry is absolutely phenomenal. And I could see a future with her, but I want some time in the present doing what I want to do before thinking about that.

I can't seem to balance taking care of others, and taking care of myself. I always feel anxious for others and ended up taking care of them, leaving me with little time for myself. And when I take care of myself, I just feel restless, worried, lazy, or just wrong.

Most of the time, I don't think it's *even* called ""for myself"" when I'm doing it with others in mind. Which makes me force myself to think of myself, and making these terrible feelings of self-hatred, restlessness, and really unhealthy or deadly thoughts because I can't let myself out and also because I'm letting myself out, not taking care of others.

I am trying to think of myself, I promise you, I am! But I can't stop thinking of others, and that makes ""me"" unable to come out fully as if a door was slammed shut on me all of the sudden when I'm just halfway going out of that door. Then have it open again, then shut again, and repeat! It feels horrible, it's painful, and I'm barely hanging.

I'm sorry if my explanation is a mess but **to put it simply; I hate it when I'm thinking of others all the time but I also hate it when I'm thinking of myself only. And I don't know what to do.**

Even until now, I should be studying, and I hate how I'm here, asking for advice that I know I need but I still hate myself for it because my exams are coming up and I can't afford to fail. Or how I was sleep deprived so, I slept throughout the day because I felt really dizzy and sick but along with waking up much better, I hated myself for sleeping. It's irrational, I know, and it's stupid but I don't know how to stop it.

If someone has an advice, even if it's just a small one, please tell me. I had an extreme meltdown before that scarred me, and I'm afraid to admit that I might actually be on my way to another one. Therapy isn't an option because we can't afford it, and if there is a medication for this anxiety, I'm kind of scared to take it without a doctor's permit.

Well, maybe not much for the latter. It's also scary opening up like this for the world to see so, I might just take a medication if someone suggests it. I just want to be stable."

I've thought about transfering colleges and taking this class somewhere else because the problem is the professor not the class. The way he teaches just doesn't work for me. All he does is talk and fast, so while I try to take notes other important info has already gone by. He rarely gives tests and quizes so the ones he does give are surprise ones and are worth a lot of your grade. It also doesnt help much that english is my second language.

Then at lunch break I was showing him my holiday flight route and jokingly said ""I'll end up dying on this plane"" because I was worried it would crash. He then proceeded to say something along the lines of: ""No, you'll die when I split your belly open."" I dont want to go into detail because its not very nice but he went on to desrcibe it.. 

He's always made these jokes since I met him about killing me and hiding my body, at first I thought it was pretty funny, silly joking around. But he now does it every day, and every lunch time we walk from school to the woods for a walk, and he's started to do weird things like getting us lost or faking an issue.

 When he goes too far I very obviously act uncomofrtable but that seems to drive him on to act even weirder. He has brought hammers and knives into school before (without anyone catching him & without actually using them)  andits like he gets a kick from making people feel scared or weirded out. When we're in the woods he'll go into detail about how he'll kill me in some gory way and then point out spots where he'll bury my body and how the police will find my blood on the snow. I'm trying not to be over sensitive and a party pooper about it but some days im not up for it and he persists. Sometimes im geuinely scared that he might do something, and he seems to have researched all these methods and ideas.

My SO is going through a rough time. As background they have self-acknowledged low self-esteem and high anxiety, which are not treated or managed with any outside assistance. They have always been somewhat hard on themselves, and have noted never really feeling content with their life, and always feeling alone. Recently they graduated school, and have been holding out for a specific job, turning down other offers along the way. After months of continued anxiety they were rejected from the job they wanted, and now feel ""worse than ever before."" They're fatigued, sometimes listless, feeling what sounds much like psychosomatic pains, and become emotionally overwhelmed easily, sometimes several times per day and with very little impetus. Though I can never know what it feels like to be them, and to have their trials, as someone who has suffered from clinical depression before I feel like I am watching them be sucked into a vicious and destructive spiral that I recognize clear-as-day, but cannot stop.

I try to listen when they want to talk, give advice when they want input, support them, and keep them occupied and out of the house whenever possible, but feel increasingly that the help they need is beyond what I can give. Many different approaches have been taken to discussions about therapy, but they will not consider it, citing that they ""tried it once, and it did not help at all,"" or stating ""nobody but me can help me solve my problems."" They have assured me that they would never hurt themselves, and I believe them, but frequently say they are ""tired; the most tired that they have ever felt."" I'm tearing my hair out. I love them, and they are in so much pain, and I feel totally incapable of helping them. How can I help them get the help that they need?

It's not the best, but no the worst, either. Most graduates seem to get a job at a small university or a government agency.

I work 20 hours/week for professors (grading, assisting with research, etc) to get my stipend, which is quite low. My program has the lowest (or the 2nd lowest) amount of stipend out of the top 50 PhD programs in the field. I commute to school 2-3 times a week. It takes 4 hours door to door each way. I only applied to the programs around the area so that I would be able to stay with my partner. My current program is the only one that offered me funding, so I had no choice.

I've been overwhelmed with the coursework, research, grading, and the long commute. I feel like I have no life outside grad school. It's not fun hanging out with friends anymore because I'm constantly worried about work.

I don't think I'm doing well academically even though I only have A's and A-'s on my transcript. I am still trying to finish an incomplete from last semester.

Another thing that stresses me out is that I rely on my partner financially because he makes more than double of what I make.

I'm thinking of leaving grad school. My partner wants to move to Europe for postdoc, and it's unlikely that I will get a job in my field. If I quit now, I will probably suffer from feeling embarrassed and not being good enough, and loss of the great health insurance I have now.

Late 20s.

Basically things were up and down in our relationship. The big problem we've had for the whole time is that my partner feels like I dont make her feel beautiful and she doesnt feel like we do enough things together. I think we've both made some efforts to do stuff together but she feels that I just dont engage enough. I had noticed she was more detached and less talkative and started spending more time with her friends(female). I was initially concerned but then I lost it when I saw that she had recently re engaged on social media with a guy that she used to be interested in. I tried to confront her about this and  she assured me that shes not interested in him and never was. I got very angry at her because she had done this behind my back after we had a lot of fights about exes, former interests, etc.. she had lost trust for me even though I'd reassured her time and time again that she could trust me and apologized for giving her any reason to doubt me. We mutually then agreed to just remove the problematic elements that we had an issue with from each others social media. She actually had suggested this and although I was reluctant I agreed because I knew if she did it too, my own doubts would be at ease. I lived up to my end of that bargain so of course I was really hurt to see she went back on it. We both stopped talking to eachother for a few days until she called me and apologized for going behind my back and doing what she did. She said that she wanted to take a break to take time and think about whether we both want to continue and we could still meet up and talk and do things unrelated to the topic of our relationship every now and again during this break. I suggested we write down our feelings and then come back together at some point to discuss what we value about our relationship, what we want to work on and how we could repair things and if we want to continue dating. She agreed to this and  we have divided the apartment so now we're living separately but in the same apartment.

Has anyone else here been in a 'break' like situation like this? How did it go? My intuition is telling me shes trying to disengage and check out of the relationship and basically doing what you do when you've left a relationship. Should I just try and move out and start over again as a single person or should I follow through and see how this break goes for us? 

Tl;dr
Trust issues have been a problem in my relationship
Theres a percieved lack of engagement in each others interests and desire to spend time with eachother
Now on a break for an undefined time with a plan to come back together and discuss how we feel afterwards.
Instinct tells me shes checked out of the relationship and has been for some time
Should I start preparing to just move out and start over?"

Lack of Common Sense,Advice,0,di9mny,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/di9mny/lack_of_common_sense/,11,1571182688.0,"All my life I have been told to ""use common sense"" and it doesn't exist and it's mean. Rant Over.

Details.

I am 23, female, and ever since I was very young I've been very good at following rules. A few examples:

1. My older sister and I were playing army and she (as my Sargent) ordered me to bust out a window, I did, she did not get in trouble, but I did. despite the fact I was just listening to my babysitter.
2. My other older sister was teaching me to make grilled cheese and was not into having to teach at all. ""It's easy, you don't need me. You put the bread it the toaster and the cheese in the microwave"" I did exactly that and got grounded and had to clean the microwave
3. In high school I was asked to move the files from the old computer to the new computer, I asked what I needed to move. ""Everything"" was their answer. I spent all day and moved every last file every last program as well as downgraded the operating system to that of the older computer. I nearly got my computer rights taken away.
4. While staying at my dad's house, I was asked to throw away the leftovers (he has a dog, my mom does not) I get grounded for throwing away the leftovers instead of leaving them out for the dog
5. Similar, the next time I was told to take the plate of leftovers out to the dog, I did. The dog broke the plate, I got in trouble as he was not supposed to get the plate.

It did not get easier as I got older and those are just a few examples.

Today, I was told on a subreddit that ""X"" topic was not allowed and neither is euphemisms about it. So I took out that part  and replaced it with \[redacted\] etc. and they banned me for breaking the rules even though it isn't a euphemism and told me i should ""use common sense""

To me, ""use common sense"" is what people say when they don't explain themselves well enough and want to make something that is their fault into your fault. I'm VERY tired of it.

How do I manage a lack of this mythical ""common sense""?

I can't get my stuff together or put effort in to anything and I feel like I'm falling apart,Advice,1,di9gd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/di9gd6/i_cant_get_my_stuff_together_or_put_effort_in_to/,1,1571181923.0,"I'm recently out of highschool and now am in the middle of my first semester of community college. I did okay for the first little while but I'm terribly unmotivated and just straight lazy. I never feel like I can get myself out of bed in the morning and most days I don't manage to. I'm behind in most classes and I get so stressed thinking about it but never do anything to fix it. Even when I know what I need to get done in a night the thought of it really starts stressing me out and I just distract myself with games or reddit. 

This sort of happened towards the end of my senior year of highschool too. Couldn't get out of bed everything felt to large and stressful and I just didn't do the work. We tried some anxiety medication but I never felt like anything worked and I knew my parents were sick of me not doing better and we're mildly upset that I missed so much school and wasn't doing well in school so once summer got here I stopped with the medications and just told them I was doing better. 

This worked okay over the summer cause there wasn't much stress or things to do. 

I avoided class scheduling cause it stressed me out until I absolutely needed to get it done. 

Last night, I stayed up on my phone until 4 or 5 am cause I didn't want to go to sleep and have tomorrow get here faster or have to try to wake up in the morning. I even tried to go without sleep so maybe it would be easier to just get up and not want to go back to sleep. I didn't manage it and couldn't get up and missed work cause I slept for too long. 

Everything feels really bad and I'm getting to be constantly sad and stressed about everything in my life but I don't do anything to fix it. Everything that's happening is my fault but I also don't know what to do to fix it or me. 

I can't do another semester of college and waste my money and my parents money if I'm not going to actually work hard, but I cant tell them that, I don't think they'd be okay with it.

I don't know how I got here. I used to do great in school and got everything done quickly without worrying one bit about it. I'm scared I can't get back to that and that I can't fix myself and I'll just be useless. I'm gonna get yelled at and my mom will ask why aren't you doing well or why are you feeling like this and I'll say I don't know. She'll tell me you do know come on don't be difficult, but I really don't know and I don't want to deal with that again and again. What do I do, I'm worried my head is gonna take it too far thinking about how nothing feels like it's going right and I'm not worth anything to anyone so I shouldn't be alive. I've always had little thoughts like this but I have always been able to just say like nah that's dumb but it's not feeling as easy anymore. I still have a good barrier of existential dread stopping me and the scariness of it all which is nice I guess. I'm scared ."

From about 2009 onward I 19/f realised my brother 22/m had been coming into my room and molesting me while I slept. To this day I have no idea how long he'd been doing this or how 'far' he went as I was an incredibly deep sleeper.

This continued until about 2014.

I tried to distance myself in 2017 after high school. But in 2018 he and his high school sweetheart 23/f moved in together. She met him while he was still abusing me and we're also sort of friends. The normal way you're friends with your siblings friends and SO's.

Anyway I'm super conflicted b/c like obviously I should've told her before they moved in together. Everytime the three of us talk I just want to blurt it out. But it would devastate her. And I can't fucking face anyone being able to look at me and know I was abused. She's sort of financially dependent on him which I know he did deliberately b/c that's what our dad did to our mom.

Idk where she would go or what she would do if she found out. I really want to spare her feelings but I also want to ruin my brother's life so I don't have to deal with knowing he's out there happier than I am. But also I would be so alone with my parents. He's the only one I can talk to about them. Also also I don't think he's abusing her or anyone else.

I've indirectly kept his secret for years by being too ashamed of being abused. I have no idea how long I can keep it up. She deserves to know he might abuse any kids they have like 20/30 years down the line. But she'll be so heartbroken especially b/c i left it so long.

Please help.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I think I have a solution, the two of them will be visiting where me and my parents live next month. What if I get her alone during the trip, tell her everything so she can make a decision here, like is she gonna be okay with it? idk. Is she going to try and stay with him and have a breakdown ten years down the line? idk. If she like wants to go back home early and without him I'm willing to deplete my savings buying her a plane ticket. I can't make that decision for her or possibly anticipate how she'll take it. But at least I can try to make sure she lands on her feet about it all.

Any suggestions?"

I will share my story and it may be a bit long but please bear with me. 

I'm 20 years old and I had failed out of university after second year for a bunch of reasons (depression, anxiety, severe PTSD, repressed trauma, unhealthy coping mechanisms). My father had forced me to go to school (mind you, it was in a hick ghost town and I, being one of the very few POC on campus felt very isolated and alone) despite me begging for a gap year. I knew I wasn't mentally stable. My family knew that as well but did not give a sh\*t. I should've ignored the threats of getting disowned, taken the year off and just stayed in a shelter as it would have saved me +30K of student loan debt + lifted so much weight. But 17 year old me did not know any better and I was very attached to my family (my father at the time was losing his vision and my younger brother was sent away for being a juvenile delinquent, family was falling apart and so was I).  

Anyway, he had big dreams of me becoming a lawyer since birth (faced abuse, anger, guilt and shaming when I expressed having my own dreams) so I went away for school. It wasn't what I wanted to do (I wanted to become a social worker but my grades weren't good enough for that program) but I did not have a choice in the matter. I was struggling A LOT. I felt so trapped and I kept forcing myself to keep going for him. But eventually after not meeting the expectations to get off academic probation, I was forced to drop out. I think it was for the best because I would not have dropped out myself. By this time he had gone completely blind, which saved me from the physical abuse I would have faced. The verbal and emotional attacks still come every now and then but I definitely feel more in control of my life and relieved in a way.

But now I'm lost. I have LOTS of debt, my family is living on social support and I am having a lot of trouble finding a job. Money isn't really the issue I guess, I'm grateful for having my basic needs met while I'm searching for a job (Dad's on disability support and mum is his primary caregiver). The pressure is still there though, to do something. To not be a ""bum"" as my father would say everyday. I'm 20 years old and I know I can do more. I just don't know where to even begin. Will I even be able to receive student loans again to cover college if I wanted to attend? Is it worth it to pursue education later, and enjoy my youth? It sounds so silly in my head but I have spent so much of my life feeling stuck, depressed and suicidal because my life felt like it wasn't mine. It finally is mine. What do I do?

Now my crew is coming in, telling me what they are going to do or they refuse to clock in then just plain lying to me about where they are and how long there breaks are taking. I am not even allowed to punish them. At the end of the year new policy will be in place so I'm guessing that's why this is happening but I'm not happy. I feel that I'm being used and abused because I haven't said no. I'm a good worker and take pride in my work but I can't keep doing this.

Where to go for graduation dinner?,Advice,0,di92pd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/di92pd/where_to_go_for_graduation_dinner/,6,1571180290.0,"So my parents are treating me to a place of my choosing for my graduation dinner, although they would like to bring along my sisters and their husbands for more of a family get-together. I initially wanted to go to an upscale restaurant with me and my parents
but now there‚Äôs gonna be like 11 of us total so I‚Äôm more inclined towards booking a decent buffet, everyone can eat as much as they like and there‚Äôll be cool things like chocolate fountains and sushi.

One of my sister will have to leave for the airport to catch a flight around 6pm (I know worst time ever right, she didn‚Äôt even check in with me) so my parents would have to drop her off. 

My issue is very simple, the buffet place has live cooking or teppanyaki available at dinner times only and I‚Äôd like go there by that time also, but it now seems like I‚Äôd have to do some time earlier for lunch instead.

My parents are now suggesting doing it one day before but I‚Äôm not sure about it because my graduation day is kinda special, I would prefer to go at night after my ceremony.

So what should I do here?"

i‚Äôve known her for over a year on social media, but she lived in a different country up until now. last week she moved to my country to live here as it‚Äôs always been her dream. so cool! i always wanted to meet her, and she seemed very excited to meet me, and we met in real life for the first time on FRIDAY and i thought it was just a normal friend meet-up until towards the end she held my hand. i was taken by surprise because it was unexpected but i thought it was sweet. we held hands the whole rest of the hangout and she kissed me goodbye at the train station, and although i was confused i was also okay with it at that point, i didn‚Äôt have much choice? kinda? as it was just a small peck and she walked off quickly. 

Straight after i got home that day she was texting me how much she missed me and asked me if i liked the kiss to which i said yes, as i felt neither way about it. She texted me that night and we set up another day to meet bc she wanted to so badly, and i did enjoy her company. 

so, yesterday, we had a ‚Äúdate‚Äù and she cuddled up to me the whole time and we kissed a LOT. the thing is, i hated it. it‚Äôs  nothing to do with her, she‚Äôs literally gorgeous and so pretty and funny and sweet, but i am just not attracted to girls! i thought i could be, but after kissing her and nearly wanting to throw up bc of how uncomfortable i felt i realise now i‚Äôm probably straight. 

anyways, as she was cuddling up to me, she asked me if i will be her girlfriend. and, i KNOW i should‚Äôve said no, but she had me right on the spot and it would‚Äôve been SO awkward if i said no, so, out of my pushoverness and bc i have no ability to say no to anyone, i said yes. i instantly felt terrible and just even more confused. 

i don‚Äôt really understand why this girl that has literally just moved to my country, that i had only met ONCE before, wants me to be her girlfriend. she never told me she liked me in that way, and she never even asked about my sexuality or said she had a crush or anything. it was just instantly ‚Äúi wanna be ur gf!!‚Äù and i am now in the awkward situation of now wondering how to tell her i am not wanting that, and after kissing her, realised i‚Äôm not into girls. like at all.

My (29F) sister (19F) has an emotionally abusive boyfriend (19F). I have a long weekend with her coming up.

My mom and sister moved away from our hometown to another part of the country to live with my mom‚Äôs new husband. My sister was 13 then. Ever since, she has struggled to make new friends and has been difficult with my mom and stepdad. She has harmed herself, talked about suicide, been committed short term, and reluctantly visited a therapist (which she immediately decided to not engage with and stopped seeing shortly after).

She met a boy and became quickly attached (and for the most part, happy). They‚Äôve been dating on and off for maybe 2 years now. He has some sort of social anxiety I believe, or is incredibly rude, because he refuses to speak to any of my family, even when he is invited for dinners and holidays with open arms. He dropped out of high school, is not seeking a job, makes my sister pay for everything and only seems interested in one hobby that lets him travel to compete. Everyone in his family is on disability, so I‚Äôm not sure how they support these decisions.

He‚Äôs never been great, but I recently got wind that he was being mean to my sister. Telling her he didn‚Äôt like how she was, that she‚Äôs mean and he doesn‚Äôt enjoy her company, that he doesn‚Äôt want to be a ‚Äúcorporate work slave‚Äù like her (what?!). She recently found him spending time with another girl, and she even traveled with him on one of his competition trips (found out through said girl‚Äôs social media).

My sister is heartbroken and thinks she has done something wrong. She wants to change herself instead of moving on. She asked if he wanted to break up and he said no (?!) so she has decided she‚Äôs the problem. I don‚Äôt care who‚Äôs fault it is, I just want my sister to respect her own wellbeing and not base her happiness on the emotions of someone else. I‚Äôm afraid that she will regress back to a less stable time.

My mom has booked her a long weekend to come visit me so she can escape the situation for a while. This is a first. I have so many things I want to say, but I don‚Äôt know how to present it. With our age gap and the geographic distance, I haven‚Äôt had much of a chance to be a sister to her. I know when I was her age, the last people I wanted advice from was family. How can I help her?

TL;DR: My sister has low self esteem and a shitty boyfriend who is emotionally abusive/possibly cheating. I have a long weekend with her and would like advice on how to help her through this situation without pushing her away."

Anyway, here‚Äôs my dilemma:

My friends family isn‚Äôt comfortable with me using their address (fair enough). I‚Äôve moved around since I was 5 (I‚Äôm 19 now) and haven‚Äôt had a permanent address in over a year. That wouldn‚Äôt bother me, except that my health insurance expired, and I can‚Äôt apply for Medicaid because the state I live in can‚Äôt verify my address! On top of that, I want to start building credit as soon as physically possible, but I need an address to get a credit card (I‚Äôm planning on using Discover, because the interest rates are nice, so I‚Äôd need to receive it in the mail). And I want to get an apartment with a friend of mine soon (so I can have an address) but because I don‚Äôt have credit it‚Äôs going to be practically impossible to find anyone to let me sign a lease. 

I‚Äôve thought about using a P.o. box or a PMB, but there‚Äôs nowhere within walking distance that I could access for that (I don‚Äôt have a car), and I‚Äôm not sure that government forms (tax returns, etc) will let me have a P.o. box as my address. 

so basically i‚Äôm 19, i have no address, no family i can turn to, no car, one friend whose parents would like me gone as soon as i‚Äôm ‚Äúback on my feet,‚Äù no credit, no insurance, and nothing but a part time job at a local Chinese restaurant. So if anyone has advice on how to dig myself out of rock bottom, please let me know! I can‚Äôt even register to vote ): 

For what it‚Äôs worth, I‚Äôm not a felon or anything! I mean I have a driving ticket but that was because I forgot to use my turn signal when I was 16 and I guess the cop had a quota or something.

Help me deal with how angry I get at people who don't see nuance,Advice,1,di8tao,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/di8tao/help_me_deal_with_how_angry_i_get_at_people_who/,5,1571179102.0,"I hope maybe some people here have worked on this same problem. I am not sure exactly what to call it, so I will try to describe it.

When I encounter people who have strong or rigid beliefs about something--especially something for which there is a good argument to be made on either side, I get too upset. For the most part, I am not actually upset at their actual opinion (I think people can have different opinions), but at their attitude toward the opinion, and what is often a dismissive/judgmental attitude toward anyone who disagrees. I struggle to describe it, but I guess it has more to do with HOW they are voicing their beliefs (non-self reflectively maybe?) than their particular beliefs. 

So for example, even though I am liberal, people who strongly voice opinions about ""cancelling"" Columbus Day might irritate me.  Not because I don't understand how horrible Columbus was historically, but because those people are not considering that for many the holiday is about Italian American pride (because they were once marginalized) than thinking Columbus is so great. So while I may actually be for changing Columbus Day holiday, the way some of those people go about it gets me upset. Likewise, if someone says about the holiday that ""people these days are offended at everything"" I would point out that, no, actually Columbus was actually horrible in all these ways, the day marginalizes native people, and so forth. The lack of self-reflection or ability to see the other side seems to trigger me somehow.

I often try to just not comment or avoid these situations, but sometimes I am forced to deal with this kind of black and white thinking at my work or with acquaintances. I sometimes feel the need to discuss a more (in my view) nuanced position, which I think is fine in the abstract, but I get upset (heart racing, fight or flight response) when I do so. Because I want to kind of take this overly self assured person down a notch, I find that sometimes I end up arguing with the person and saying things I don't even agree with to try to prove them wrong just because their attitude pisses me off. Then afterwards, I feel embarrassed and ashamed because I made an ass of myself and sort of lost control. 

I guess it boils down to: how can I engage with someone who is extreme or overly self-assured without getting so upset at their extremeness? I know intellectually that I am unlikely to change these people's minds, so what is even the point? Yet I keep getting sucked in because just never saying anything seems like wimping out. 

Any ideas for helping to deal with this? Do I just not engage or is there a way to remain more calm and not feel such situations as an emotional fight?

I acknowledge that I too have some issues that are hard for me to see nuance in btw. I was thinking maybe this could somehow help me feel less angry toward this type of person?"

There hasn‚Äôt been a day within the past maybe 3 months where i havent gotten high, I just don‚Äôt wanna be in this world anymore, I don‚Äôt wanna be in a world where I‚Äôm alone. I‚Äôm not particularly ugly in fact I have a pretty reasonable following of a few social medias cause of my looks. Or what I presume to be my looks considering that‚Äôs what‚Äôs being broadcasted to the audience. But it just isn‚Äôt the same, I would rather be loved by the one I still cherish than everyone in the world loving me. It‚Äôs gotten to the point to where I wake up and just want to commit suicide. The only thing that has stopped me is I don‚Äôt want the publicity after I die. I want to die without it being a major event but with social media if I pass all the people who hated me suddenly become my friend and say rip in my name. I‚Äôve seen it happen an endless amount of times. That might be a stupid excuse but it‚Äôs the only thing in my head when I contemplate ending it. Somebody please help I feel as if another month sitting in my bedroom. Jobless, homeschooled, upset, and on drugs is gonna drive me to the point of pure insanity.

One of my friends behaved like a scumbag and I'm at a loss,Advice,3,di4qjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/di4qjf/one_of_my_friends_behaved_like_a_scumbag_and_im/,3,1571156098.0,"So I learned one of my oldest friends,a mutual friend of me and my best friend whom he knows since childhood, had an affair with the roommate of my best friend. My best friend told him about how he liked her and he made his move after that and lies to his face about it for months, made her say nothing because 'he wanted to handle telling it to others'. The worst part about this is that he started to talk trash to the chick about his oldest friend, for whatever reason, maybe to discredit him and fortify his position he also talked very badly about his GF and how he was just looking for a way out. Its absolute scumbag-level shittyness.
He is in a relationship and his girlfriend, who took him in when he lost his flat, supported him financially when he lost his job, who was carrying his frigging child during the time of those events, doesn't know a thing about all this.
So I know I won't be hanging out with him anymore, because people who treat others like this can f right off in my book.
I am just unsure about whether or not I should tell his girlfriend about the whole thing. I'm friends with her too but being a single mom sucks, even though she has a great job. But being cheated on in such a dirt bag way... I would want to know.

Apparently the Bride to be was less than impressed that we went to a strip club for his bacholar party  and I am not welcome at the wedding at all so much so that I have to pull out and not be apart of the event now I TOTALLY understand her point of view and am not going to fight her decision she has made. But I'm really upset as she never spoke to me before about the party any anything offlimits- full disclosure the were no hookers or drugs. Just dinner, then drinks then a strip club. Nothing more. 
Not a single person objected, no one was forced into anything but I've been made the scapegoat.

Dince being told ive been thinking it all over and have spoken to maybe 20 people (family and friends) and well they have all said she's way out of line, overreacting and my mate should stand up and say something about it being his wedding too and so forth.

Also during this time I've thought a whole lot more about it as her decsison was made a week before the wedding.

- Seems like she never liked me, at all. 
(Which is fine we never really hung out or anything 
- She never wanted me to be best man. 
(Assuming from the same reasons above)
- It appears it may also be a racial thing (I could be totally over thinking it) as I was one of the few white guys going to the wedding at all.
- I am the only person being excluded from the wedding, even the other groomsman is allowed to go and is still in the wedding party, and he was at the bachelor party as well.
- All the other guys at the bachelor party are going including her younger brother.
- She obviously has found a suitable replacement and forced my mate to accept it (Or else - is my geuss)

when we talk I make her laugh heaps, I'm not and ugly guy and I'm pretty confident. To the point where she is comfortable talking to me about her first time having sex and explain to me in detail (shes only ever had sex once) and any sexual thing I ask I would end up getting the answer out of her even tho she's one of the keep to herself girls. I always make little sexual flirtatious comments that I act like they are casual and continue the conversation. I know she trust me.

So I'm just wondering do you think I should put in the work talk to her more break her down till we hang out just us to 

Because I she might be in denial that she likes me, maybe because she doesn't find me attractive enough, and me straight up asking her if she likes me or telling her I like her might scare her away, as I know she might think I like her but she's I've never committed to just saying it because for teens it might push them away is it's too forward

My teacher boyfriend is being wrongly accused.,Advice,1,di87pj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/di87pj/my_teacher_boyfriend_is_being_wrongly_accused/,2,1571176341.0,"So I‚Äôll try to keep it short. My boyfriend has been teaching martial arts (taekwondo) for nearly 9 years now. He is 21 years old. He also substitute teaches at the local high school and student teaches as an elementary school while he earns his physical education degree. He absolutely loves teaching. He is the favorite teacher in every setting he is in. Kids love him and so do parents. 

Recently, a man (let‚Äôs call him Rich) came in to the martial arts school to put his daughter in a few classes. Without even knowing who my boyfriend is, he accused him of being ‚Äútoo touchy‚Äù with students because the little ones hug him and he adjusts their body position when they do martial arts forms. My boyfriend was obviously very upset, but nothing came of it. 

Also to add, Rich‚Äôs wife does not believe these things about my boyfriend, and thinks Rich is being ridiculous. She also does not stop him from saying these things. 

Now a few months later, another martial arts kid (we‚Äôll call her Sarah) goes home and says ‚Äú(Rich‚Äôs daughter) says she can‚Äôt come to taekwondo because (my boyfriend) touches her.‚Äù Both kids were in the same class at school. 

Sarah‚Äôs mom immediately texts Rich‚Äôs wife and defends my boyfriend, basically saying that Rich should never be saying things like that and should clear it up with his daughter, because you don‚Äôt just throw things around like that. She points that that it could ruin my boyfriend‚Äôs life. Rich‚Äôs wife says ‚Äúoh well it was just some wrong information‚Äù. Like it isn‚Äôt a huge deal. 

There is absolutely no way my boyfriend is ever inappropriate with the children. Their parents are present at all times, he is never alone with them, he is under camera surveillance, and he has never had another incident like this. In fact, the parents like him so much that when he leaves to become a teacher, 80% of them are quitting taekwondo. 

The only time he is ever alone with a child is if he personally knows the parents (for example, he used to drive my landlord‚Äôs kid to work with him so he could go to taekwondo class. We were good friends with my landlord.) 

Here‚Äôs where the advice comes in. Both of us are absolutely terrified of what could come of this. Our lives are just getting started, we are newly engaged and are buying a house soon. We rely heavily on my boyfriend‚Äôs income, and this ‚Äúwrong information‚Äù could ruin his life. Both of us can‚Äôt sleep, we are both terrified, and can‚Äôt stop worrying. What do we do?

I am so afraid this will ruin his life. I‚Äôm afraid that someone will hear the little girl say it, report it, and then my boyfriend will be barred from ever having a teaching job (his life‚Äôs passion) or even potentially going to jail. 

(Please don‚Äôt tell me ‚Äúmaybe he did it‚Äù, he didn‚Äôt. Rich‚Äôs wife even acknowledges that the accusation is ridiculous but ‚Äúwon‚Äôt go against what he says‚Äù.)"

She wont talk and.she just wants to be alone. ( She had a previous alchohol problem that I am worried will return because of this) She also struggles with anxiety and depression.  And I dont know how to comfort her while still giving her space. 

I dont know how to cope with this. I'm so mad at my father. But I love him to death. I havent heard his side of the story at all - but I'm so hurt that he would do this to my mom.  I'm very conflicted on my feelings because I want my parents to be happy. They both deserve it - with or without each other. However, if my father was unhappy I am mad that he chose this as his exit route. 

Their marriage has been rocky for years because of my mothers alchohol addiction meshed with depression and anxiety paired with my dad feeling burnt out for taking care of everything for years ( care for us - Bills- full time job - house maintenance etc) while my mom was checked out. Add the stress of issues financially  and it's a perfect mess.  If I'm being honest if they told us they were separating I would not.of been surprised. But this completely has myself and my siblings in a tizzy. 

But what do I do? How do I be there for my mom? She doesnt really have friends to talk to and I'm sure she wants to leave my extended family out of it so her kids are all she has. And How can I forgive my dad? How do.i support my mom and my dad at the same time?  I'm hurt and angry for my family.

She doesn‚Äôt have a lot else going for her and is VERY attached to this animal, which I get. I adore all of my pets and I treat them very well. 

That being said, I‚Äôve had this dog for three weeks now, and things have gotten weird. The first day I had him, she called me after only 6 hours to see how he was doing. Then she told me (after she sent me with three huge bags of dog stuff) that she had just remembered that he has a chair that‚Äôs just his at her house, and asked me to come get it so he could have it to sit in. I politely declined and let her know that I have a lot of furniture for him to choose from. I told her I would call her with an update later. 

I called her about a week after that and let her know that he was settling in nicely. She told me that the day before she had spent the whole day crying. I wasn‚Äôt sure what to say about that so I told her that I understand and that I would take very good care of him and got off the phone.

Now for the concerning part, she just called me again, clearly VERY intoxicated. She was slurring her speech, and it‚Äôs not  even 1:30pm. She told me how sad she is and asked what I planned to do with the dog when he died. That she would like him cremated and she wants his ashes back when he goes.

Now, I work in a funeral home, I get grief. She‚Äôs a sad old lady who gave up her only friend and is having a hard go, I get that.

(Kinda long.)

So, I put on a stained shirt this morning. Once I got to school, I went into the bathrooms as I usually do now and tried to clean the stains off. By then most students' classes had already started and I broke down in tears for a little while. I'm still in the bathrooms and second class has started (most likely from what I've heard from outside). To get into class, I'd need a tardy slip but I got to school on time. I don't want to walk around with a stained shirt so I'll probably try to clean it in a little bit. We have lockers, and I haven't taken my stuff out of my bookbag and placed my bookbag in my locker. The lockers and first to fourth class are all very near eachother and stuff. I'm especially worried about coming in mid class not having a tardy slip. I've thought about skipping this school day but what if my, parents find out, plus, I'm already stacked with missed homework/assignments (which I've been trying to complete) as it is...

To just go to exploratories (not near my locker) I'd still have my backpack with me and... well...

That's pretty reasonable I think and it has been my exact response to my father (who has another awful condition) before I developed my own but right now I'm unsure as to what me, my ex and father should all do.

Yes, our emotions are under our control but at the same time not. My condition gives me tremors, a lot of them, so I constantly get weird looks and am unable to do many things. My father can't walk and needs even more assistance than me. How can we not be sad and angry about that? It feels impossible to us and in fact it is because neither of us know how to cope. Also, the other person being affected doesn't care whether we find a way or not, no one (understandably perhaps) of us three want to feel the anger and sadness of the other, causing almost all of us to not want to be together. My father is different in that aspect because he wants to be with me still, but I don't with him and my ex doesn't with me.

Sorry for the long post, tl;dr at the bottom.

I originally thought to post this to r/legaladvice but as of writing this I don‚Äôt have a clear legal question. If there is a better avenue to seek advice, kindly let me know. 

Some background: My father was diagnosed with terminal cancer a few weeks back and is given between six months and two years depending on how he responds to treatment. Right now things aren‚Äôt looking too good. His long time girlfriend‚ÄîK from hereon‚Äîalong with one of her daughters and her four grandkids live with him. The mother of K‚Äôs grandchildren is in prison for a very long time which lead to her adopting them; however the youngest of the four was adopted by her daughter that lives with them. The oldest of the four is a young teenager. Neither K nor her daughter work, my father makes a little over enough to pay the mortgage and the rest comes from financial assistance from the state for the kids. K has a huge gambling problem and has had her car repossessed several times over the last few years which my father has helped her reclaim. Each time he didn‚Äôt know she was in debt until the car is suddenly gone. She is a generally deceitful and vindictive person, I believe he stays with her because he cares for the children. 

My father has owned his home for nearly 25 years and claims there is a substantial amount of equity in it. Aside from that he doesn‚Äôt have much in assets. When he passes he said he would like to split everything four ways‚Äîbetween myself, my two siblings, and K. He also said he wants to give K a year to sort out her situation before vacating the home. We have no personal issue with this other than the fact she will surely gamble with her portion and we don‚Äôt trust her to pay the mortgage given her record.  We recently found out they were two months behind and we paid to get them caught up. Additionally, my brother stopped by the house and sent me pictures, it is absolutely *filthy*. My father would like to do his treatment in home so my siblings and I hired a cleaning crew to start working on it. I don‚Äôt live in the state and have been out of the country on a work assignment but will be flying out next week to visit him, start sorting through his belongings, and do my part in cleaning things up. The condition of the home has seriously deteriorated over the last few years and we intend to spend some time fixing it up before it‚Äôs eventually sold.

My main questions are as follows: Is it possible to ensure that K‚Äôs portion of his estate actually goes toward providing a stable environment for the children? Also, if she gets the notion that we are trying to wrong her in any way I have no doubt she will try to sabotage us somehow...she took a hammer to their 60in TV when she thought my father was trying to break up with her. We need to eventually facilitate her and the kids finding a new home so we can get the house in order to sell. Any advice on doing this?

It‚Äôs a mess, I know, but any advice that could give us some direction would be incredibly appreciated. Also it‚Äôs probably worth noting that my older sister was granted power of attorney but we are all working together to try to come to a solution. Thank you reddit. 

tl;dr My father is terminally ill and would like to give his girlfriend an equal portion of his estate. She has a serious gambling problem and lives off welfare from her three adopted grandchildren. We need to eventually facilitate her moving out of his home so we can fix it up to sell it. Additionally, if possible, we would like to ensure that her portion is not gambled away and instead goes toward the wellbeing of the children."
how do i convince my super traditional mother to let me stay the night at a guys house,Advice,0,di71ky,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/di71ky/how_do_i_convince_my_super_traditional_mother_to/,7,1571170593.0,"i am an 18f nd this guy i have been seeing invited me out and offered for me to stay the night at his (i‚Äôve stayed the night there a few times before but i told my mum i was with a female friend). i cant use the same excuse i did last time because it is just me and him going out with no other friends. my options are either:

- completely lying to her about who i‚Äôm going out with that night and saying i‚Äôm sleeping over at a female friends house. 

or

- trying to convince her to let me stay over at his house after the date 

i feel super uncomfortable lying to her and i hate doing it but she is really unreasonable and refuses to treat me like an adult so i know trying to convince her will usually end in a screaming match. also the night i‚Äôm going out with him is the same night that some relatives are flying in to stay over at my house so i‚Äôm getting kicked out of my room anyway. i really wanna stay with him that night but i know my mum will flip out. any advice ?"

&#x200B;

2 years ago (i was 16) i had my first and only love, 4 months after, we were done, i mean, she (17f, 15 at that time) was done. there was only really a problem that was pulling me down after that. she's from my class, and I had, and still have to see her everyday.

since then i have never been able to pull out of it, and i had so much help.

we ended the relationship in supposedly good terms, little did I know it would hurt this much, i tried to get her back for the entirety of the first half of 2018, way to waste time lol.

she moved on into another relationship a couple months afterwards and shes still in it, she always raises her voice when she talks about her boyfriend and I happen to be around, she always shares details that I could do really well with not knowing, whatever this means i try to ignore it, there was this and a couple more signs that I think meant she still thinks at least a bit about me, she just acts weird around me, she once r/oopsdidntmeanto 'd me with the message ""I love you"" I still remember that moment like it was right now, time slowed down to a crawl and i just asked ""do you really"" and she laughed and said it wasnt supposed to be for me. she has no idea i still feel like this. I thought about telling her in the end of this school year, when i probably wont see her ever again, maybe giver the little silver necklace that i wanted to give her on her birthday before we broke up, something for her to remember me.

anyways im getting side tracked.

&#x200B;

I never tried to get into another relationship despite having the opportunity, i didnt want to, i didnt feel as attracted to this new girl as i felt for my ex girlfriend, i didnt want to get in a relationship where I know I would just end up looking for my ex in this new girl and end up hurting her because of that.

other than that i feel like theres nothing that I haven't tried, make more friends, have more hobbies, developing passions (for things, like cars), healthier lifestyle, enjoy things on my own in general, whatever, you name it. 

between those friends there was this girl that I had known before but only actually opened up to her short after the breakup, she helped me do all of the things above and she helped me grow into the person I am today. but before this summer (that just ended) we stopped talking, theres no bitterness between each other i think, but being friends again isnt really an option.

anyways 2 years after the breakup im a much better person, phisically (phisycally, physically? idk, sorry not my mother language) and mentally. i have so much more and better friends than i did before, mostly female, some of those friends know about this but probably think im over it, they tell me she wasted a great guy and say that im legitimately a dream guy or whatever, but I feel like thats just patting me on the back, not that I have bad self esteem, I have great self esteem, im actually purposely cocky in a funny and outgoing way, I know that Im good looking, I know Im funny smart bla bla bla whatever, but ""dream guy"" just seems too exaggerated. and after 2 years i now have well settled objectives and a path to follow.

but all that feels useless when i still can't get over a girl i dated 2 years ago, i still have the matte black plastic heart she gave me, i accidentaly broke it but never really told her because we dont talk at all, she probably doesnt even remember it exists despite that she told me she would keep it. everything is exactly in its place but i still feel unhappy and I still think more about her than I would like to admit. to be quite honest i don't know exactly what exactly im asking here, I just need something even thought i feel like ive heard everything.

the thought of her and being close to her still makes me unconsciously smile and I hate it, and i hate the fact that i can never do anything to snap out of it. its just there, a lingering feeling of.. whatever this is called.

it bothers me so much, it bothers me that nothing feels right.

theres nothing that I do, no place that i go, no time i spend that I can actually believe myself when i try to think ""yeah this is fine without her"".

&#x200B;

im sorry for the long thing, this is pretty raw and if you find mistakes or other things its because im really exhausted and i apologize in advance

if you actually read and reply with help, thank you so much."
Ethical dilemma about going to a concert,Advice,2,di4t5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/di4t5x/ethical_dilemma_about_going_to_a_concert/,9,1571156608.0,"Okay, so some context. A band that I recently got into and really like (After the Burial) is doing a show in my town in the next couple months. The headliner on this tour is As I Lay Dying. They used to be one of my favorite bands about a decade ago, but their vocalist lost all my respect when he attempted to take a hit out on his wife. Luckily, the hit man was an undercover officer and he got caught. He‚Äôs out of jail and they‚Äôve begun recording and touring again. There‚Äôs been no statement from his now ex-wife about whether she‚Äôs forgiven him. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs just trying to move on with her life, but I could only imagine having someone want you dead bad enough to pay someone to kill you is pretty hard to get over.

Anyways, I‚Äôm torn because I want to go see this band I‚Äôm into, and the other 4 members of As I Lay Dying are all awesome guys, but it feels wrong to have my dollars support someone who is willing to pay someone to murder his wife and and mother of their children. I‚Äôve specifically chosen not listened to their music because of his actions, but do I boycott the whole because of the actions of one bad actor?"

I am an introvert type of guy, suffering from anxiety and depression, all of which make it hard to find jobs, even bad jobs. Which make it had to get by. Also make it hard to build or even start relationships, friendly or romantic, which leave one to wonder their worth as a person. 

Anyway, several months back I was temporarily laboring somewhere. Most of the workers were sluggish so I had to do more work. At some point, a man, who had visited my employer a couple of times while I was there, came to me and made a comment, essentially saying that I should stop being a sucker doing the work of others. I don't remember what I answered to that but, for whatever reason, he took an interest in me so we started conversing; it was mostly him asking questions about me. 

As I found out, even though it was already apparent from the way he was dressed, he's loaded. And he right away offered me a stable job, despite the fact that I didn't have some of the basic qualifications. He said that's easily resolved and paid for my driving lessons, bought me (expensive) suits, shoes etc. All this was in stark contrast with what happened in the past. No one ever gave me a long-term job, not even jobs I was able to do. Now someone is paying from his pocket in order to make me fit for the job he wants to give me. I hadn't bought any new clothes in over a decade and now I'm extremely well-dressed. I'm also able to take care of my health which was deteriorating fast and to also help my mother. He has also introduced me to his family and frequently invites me to family dinners etc.

Apart from that, though, I also know that not all the work he's involved in is legal (which is kinda expected I guess) and for all his charisma and charm, he's mostly despised and feared by other people. So far he hasn't involved me in any illegal business and I doubt if he intends to. This and the fact that, on the contrary, he has involved me with his family both job-wise and on a personal level, make me think that he's being genuinely good to me and that there's no catch. 

Or, rather, the only catch seems to be the ethical conundrum which is the topic's subject. What should one do in such a situation where one is more than good to you but most certainly is not that good with others? Am I just being selfish and turning a blind eye? Is this any different than other jobs where you know that your employers are not saints? What's your advice?"

As I got close to her, she jerked the wheel abruptly to turn into a grocery store parking lot that was on the right, which brought her directly across my path. I got her broadside and all I had time to do was slam on my brakes. I had my 2 young kids in the back seat and they started screaming  and crying in fear.  She continued into the parking lot and I followed her. She stopped and got out crying.  I told her, ‚Äúhoney, you cut me off‚Äù, then I asked her if she was okay and she said her body hurt and something about a lady cutting her off then she got back in the car and started driving, I assumed  to find a place to park. Instead, she went around and behind the store back toward the street. I chased her in my badly damaged car and when I saw she was at the stop sign to get back on the street I pulled my car over, jumped out (leaving my screaming kids in the car) and ran up to her car. I took a picture of her plate then I walked up to her window. She was still crying and I told her basically, ‚Äúyou have to stay here. You‚Äôll get in more trouble if you leave. I‚Äôm not mad, I‚Äôm scared too. It‚Äôs going to be okay. People make mistakes.‚Äù

She backed up and parked. I called the police and said she might need an ambulance. I asked her if she had insurance and she said she was renting her car through some app I‚Äôve never heard of (car sharing?). She said maybe there was paperwork in the glove box. I don‚Äôt think she has insurance.

My question is, should I be worried about her suing me later? She was in pain but I‚Äôm pretty confident it was not my fault. I‚Äôm a very defensive driver and I was aware she was tailgating that car in front of her and having some weird issue well before the accident. I didn‚Äôt have any time to react.

He says things like ""you make my life worse, your mother's life worse, your sisters life worse"", ""I'm so fucking close to removing you from my life completely"", ""How fucking dare you make me feel like this"". He slams doors over and over. The first time I heard him carrying on, I called the police to report a domestic disturbance. The police popped by, and I assume nothing else happened. Obviously the dad hasn't checked his behaviour.
I don't know what this girl has been doing, but his vitriol is completely unacceptable. It's disrespectful to everyone else in the street, but more than that, he's no doubt fucking up his daughter mentally.
I've never met these neighbours - I've never even seen the daughter. I want to do something, but I'm at a loss of what I could do that keeps me safe (that dad sounds absolutely insane) AND gives the daughter an avenue to be safe too.

I am supposed to return to work after a three month sabbatical and I feel so anxious I want to throw up.,Advice,20,dhuv8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dhuv8p/i_am_supposed_to_return_to_work_after_a_three/,18,1571106949.0,"Background:


About three and a half months ago, I left my job on sabbatical to spend three months traveling around Europe. When I approached my job about me leaving, I didn‚Äôt expect them to approve the time off. I thought I would have to quit but, to my surprise, my manager gave me the time off. It‚Äôs a small company so my manager is also the Vice President.


Well, about a month and a half in, I returned to the US. My depression had taken a serious nosedive while I was traveling and, at the point I decided to return, I was contemplating suicide. Once I got home, I did not contact anyone, not even my friends about returning (Still haven‚Äôt). I went to a day program for depression and found it mostly non helpful but I have stabilized and am no longer actively suicidal. 


I have spent the month after the program working with my therapist and psychiatrist on therapy and finding the right meds but we have not made any great progress. I have been working at dealing with my depression for two years now, after many years of ignoring it, but improvements have been slow and minor. 


Time has passed. Next Monday is supposed to be the day I return. I need to contact my boss today about my return. I know he is already frustrated with my lack of communication. But I have spent the entire past week in breakdown mode. I am so scared of going back. I don‚Äôt know what I will tell my coworkers. I am scared of dealing with my bosses frustration. And I am really scared of returning to a job that I could barely manage mentally before, when I had my grand European tour to work towards and dream about on hard days.


Part of me really wants to not return. I still have plenty of savings and I have very strong reasons to believe I could find another job. But part of me thinks I should return. I genuinely like my coworkers and have missed them. The work environment is pretty low stress and I don‚Äôt want to burn the bridge that being given sabbatical leave and then immediately bailing before return would definitely burn. My boss, while ultimately being an okay guy, is the kind of person to hold grudges and is an important guy in the industry. Plus I have a family member that works in the same company and I am scared that it will reflect badly on them.


I have no idea what to do and am super overwhelmed. I was working with the plan to return for ~3 months (the minimum I figured I needed before leaving would be a dick move) and then try to find some part time work in my industry while I work on getting healthier. I still live at home so it would be feasible. But returning scares the hell out of me. I don‚Äôt know what to say. I don‚Äôt want to lie but I don‚Äôt want to tell the truth.

Do you think I should return or should I quit. If I return, what should I tell my coworkers when they ask about my trip?"

"I love volleyball and soccer and I would love to play them outside of school but I'm really bad at them, what should I do?",Advice,1,di5y8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/di5y8t/i_love_volleyball_and_soccer_and_i_would_love_to/,3,1571164111.0,"Really the question says most of it.

In my school they get all of us to play a different sports each month/term; just recently soccer season ended and the girls have started playing volleyball, while the boys are doing rugby.
Just like last year and the year before I really enjoyed both sports and just the thought that somewhere in this term we will have to switch with the boys makes me kind of upset.
I was thinking about joining a team or an after school activity of these sports but I myself am not a really physically active person, my reaction time sucks ass and I'm just not fit (not overweight, but if I run for more than 2 minutes without some distraction I die).
I'm scared that being with people who probably have played for years will just make me everyone's laughing stock. I struggle with anxiety a lot so this kind of thing freaks me out.

I know that if I want to get better at these sports I have to start from somewhere, but what should I actually do? I'm the worst in my year when it comes to this, volley and soccer are the only ones where I'm ever so slightly better than some of my classmates because you don't really need height for them (not even in volleyball if you're good) and I'm really, really short. We're talking about 1.40m short here. About 4'5 if I'm not wrong.

The sport I'm interested in most is volleyball, but I'm so bad at it I can't even pass the ball over the net. The only thing I can do is serving, and that I'm damn good at. Like everybody talks about how I'm shit at everything but they want me in their team because I'm amazing at serving.

Soccer though I'm actually ok at. I usually lead the girls team (in my class most of the girls don't even want to be there) and I've versed some of the boys before. I'm good at being mid and defending, but attacking is meh and goalkeeper is a definite no.

I feel like sports would really help me be more in peace with myself and be more active and social, maybe even lift my mood up a bit.

We dated online(through social media; we did stuff like call, video-chat, send pics, etc..) For a little over 2 months and broke up about 2 weeks ago.
When I started dating him, I had just gotten out of an abusive 7 month long relationship and was still kind of hurt from it and he was there to comfort me. Honestly, I was so stupid.
We just talked for a while and he just asked me out. He told me he was 15. Then a few weeks later I found out the truth and he told me his actual age.
He was so sweet when it started but eventually he went full blown sexual with it, subtly trying to get me to send nudes and stuff. I never did.

I came to the realization that this stuff is seriously f**ked up and broke up with him. I don't know why I was so stupid to start dating him in the first place. I'm just young and stupid..

Anyways, I decided to stop by his prophile because I forgot to block him after the breakup and he had actually filled out his bio saying stuff like his age, interests, and all that stuff.
But then his status said taken.
And it linked to an account.
So I clicked on it.
And the first thing in the bio was basically ""Hi! I'm ____! I'm a 12 1/2 year old girl that likes to draw and..""

It linked to my ex.

(lol first post so sorry if it's a bit messy and long!)

Just a little backstory-- I'm a Canadian, but I'm currently studying in Beijing, China to learn mandarin. I've been here for a year now, so I'm pretty acquainted with the staff around my campus, but there are a lot of people in higher-up positions who generally don't stay within school grounds for their work, and only come for special occasions or for visits. Because I study in a school with mainly international students, the school takes a lot of care into making sure we're satisfied with the study and living environment here. In my class, I have the position of class leader, which means that I'm pretty involved with communicating with staff, and on the occasion where there's a class meeting, I'd attend as a representative. We had such a meeting recently, where the class leaders all came together and we discussed any issues we might have, and how to resolve them. We had it in our school's fancy-shmancy board meeting room, which I found odd, and there was a photographer there to take pictured while we talked, which was much odder, until I overheard one of my teachers mention that the Dean was coming to listen in on the student concerns.

I was curious who it might be, but judging by the fact that there was one man sitting smack dab in the middle of the meeting room, with the only mic that was on, I had a pretty good hunch who it was. And to be honest, I didn't notice anything very special about him at first, because I wasn't sitting directly in front of him, but I did think he looked rather young from a side-angle.

As the meeting started, I was pretty nervous cause of the apparent importance of this guy coming, but the mood was lighthearted, and I waited a bit to speak up about my own concerns. Then, part-way through, even though I had just been sitting and listening, I noticed that the Dean was looking at me. He was obviously much older than me, and when we locked eyes and he smiled, wearing an expression that i couldn't place an emotion on, I felt my heart beating wildly. He had a face that was very kind, and breathtakingly handsome. My brain kinda just turned into that scene from spongebob where his little brain spongebobs are going wild in his cranium and lighting the place on fire, while on the outside I mustered up a nervous smile back to him. It was just one of those ""oh no he's hot"" situations, cause holy shit, even though he was older he looked like a goddamn actor, or like a model for men's suits or something, he had really nice skin and the way he looked at me was like I was the only person in the room who he'd taken any special notice in. That little strange glance with and exchange of smiles wasn't a one time thing ok, I kept catching him looking my way, and every time I swear I was lighting up like a goddamn lighthouse, and I'd smile at him like he was the sun to my moon, look away shyly, and swear at myself cause good fucking god am I seriously trying to flirt with the Dean of my university in the middle of a meeting???? Like get it together you thirsty gdmt.

The meeting ended, but I'm still held up on it. I've had dreams about him! I keep hoping I'll run into him, I've even asked my other teacher about him, and he spoke about him like he was the King, like I should be careful about going around asking stuff about him. Which should make me think oh ok lets leave that gasoline unlit, but tbh the power difference thing got me like OOF. I've heard there will be another meeting soon and I'm just crossing my fingers that he'll be there.

I know it's wrong, I'm 20 and he's gotta be around 40, but I seriously can't get him out of my head, and I don't know how to approach this situation! I just wanna smash but is that wrong??? Should I try to initiate something if I see him again?? He might be married I don't even know y'all please help.

((TL:DR The Dean of my school looked me in the eyes and gave me mad butterflies and now I wanna get with a man at least 20 years older that me who I haven't even talked to personally))"

Dad cheating on my mom,Advice,3,di1yyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/di1yyf/dad_cheating_on_my_mom/,8,1571138931.0,"Mostly I just don't where to begin with this, just that I'm 21 years old, and have no idea how to handle the situation. 

Yesterday night when me, my mom and my dad were chillen in the living room; my mom started to make jokes about my dad having some sort of girlfriend in the Dominican Republic. 

Because my family makes jokes all the time, I didn't think anything of it. But when my dad when to work that night (he has night shifts), my mom told me that she found some messages of some woman saying ""Babe are you going to work?"" on his facebook messenger, without my dad knowing.

So after quick research that my mom had done, my dad's secret girlfriend and himself met through facebook, and have been talking since January. My mom has no idea what to do. My first thought was to have some hard evidence and see where we can go from there. Possibly talking to a divorce lawyer in secret. 

Technically he hasn't done anything, but my stance is that if he is willing to keep something like this a secret from my mom for this long, then he's already an untrustworthy kind of guy. They've been married 20 years though, and this is the first I've heard of my dad ever trying to cheat. 

On the other side, my mom does have some issues that she's working through. She has some ADHD. She can be really bipolar. So this qualifies as something that maybe a marriage counselor can maybe work out. 

But the question on whether me and mom should confront my dad? I have no idea. 

My dad has been keeping us financially afloat for years. My mom not so much. Meaning if my parents divorce, I'd decide to live with my mom, but we would be on the rocks barely struggling to survive. I'm in nursing school already, and right now I'm already broke. A situation like this would make it even harder for me to get through nursing school, because I'd have to get a job to help my mom. 

So, I have no idea what to do. Any help is appreciated, and honestly I'm shaking. I don't know how to react, and I both love my parents so dearly that divorce would be something I'd take super hard. I just can't believe my dad would do this to my mom. I didn't think he could be like this, and it's facing the reality of the situation which I'm struggling with also."

After Xmas last year (2018) my dad died from cancer. I tried to go back to work 5 days after he died but was sent away again for messing things up in a meeting when I was trying to organise his funeral.

I returned to week about 10 days later and my work was to a high standard until I got married in May and had my first son in late May. He's called Gabriel and is amazing. I had 2 months off and when I got back to work my boss sent me to a new client where I can work 2 days a week from home but the other 3 days involve a 45 min train journey, an hour of cycling and another 20 minutes commuting. So those days involve a lot of commute which is why I am working only 3/5 days there.

Add to all this I am in in constant pain and need a hip replacement because I have severe arthritis in my right hip. I have a pre-operation assessment later this month. I take Tramadol which leaves me very fatigued and affects my concentration. The client is beginning to notice.

I want to keep going but I've noticed my mental well being is taking a huge downward trend. Maybe a few weekends ago I broke down in tears in the shower one Sunday morning and this happened late last week too.

I think I've been lucky having two months off for leave with the new baby from paternity leave and I can work 2 days from home too. But something isn't right and I'm struggling. I can't walk very well and cycling is OK but I find I'm getting weaker and weaker.

Should I ask for more time off work?

Dad died late last year from cancer
Got married had kid in May
Back to work July; long long commute 3 days/week 
Severe arthritis in hip. Unable to walk properly and on heavy opiate pain killers
Work suffering

so after this happened M proceed to break one of my best mates hart then one of my other mates and pissed of a bunch of girls in the group and then tried to start a roomer that my gf (E) was pregnant and because of that i basically got her exiled from the group because of that and all the stupid shit she had also said to the girls plus all the fucked up things she told me that she did wile we liked each other (we called almost every night for like 6 months), i brushed off these things because i liked her. Basically i hated her for months and E also hated her for other shit that im going to leave out, also 2 other girls one has with the most influence in the group also hate her (ill call them K and F).

so to the actual problem M has decided she want to join the group again to hang out with her friends who still like her and has come to hang out with us at lunch, E,K and F are trying to get rid of her but dont know what to do and at this rate every one in the group is going to be forced to pick sides and every one is going to split up and i really dont want to happen. 

also the group is about 13 people and some dont like her, some like her and some dont care 

any ideas cus as i see it there are 3 options for us (E,K,F and i)

1. we let her back in and get over it (like 10% chance of that happening)
2. we try ban her again and force the group to pick sides possibly making the group split up
3. we leave the group

I usually get one of two reactions: ‚ÄúYour family is so beautiful and inspirational!‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou are all horrible people and shouldn‚Äôt be here!‚Äù. It‚Äôs very difficult for people to see my situation as just a human being going through something, everyone wants to impose their political view on it. And while it is an inherently political issue - I‚Äôm just a human being that‚Äôs going through something, at the end of the day. I need to get out of this situation with minimal trouble. I‚Äôm about to go insane.

My parents moved to the United States from a country that was *not* war torn, impoverished, or a particularly tough place to live. **I am in the United States legally.** They are not particularly good people, they didn‚Äôt move here so that I could ‚Äúhave more opportunities,'' they don‚Äôt contribute particularly much (they sort of pay taxes... that's it). Their lives would be alright back in their country of birth, it‚Äôs one of the wealthiest countries on the continent it belongs to. **Most importantly, I had no choice in any of this. I don‚Äôt want my life to look like this.**

My dad is a severe alcoholic. He drives drunk regularly. He is a huge pervert, and has sexually traumatized me. He is very vulgar, aggressive, and bad mannered. He once drunkenly drove me to school, narrowly avoiding getting into a car accident - when I expressed that I was terrified, he sped up just to scare me more. This is why it hurts so much when people assume we're good people because my parents are immigrants. To be honest, I'm surprised he hasn't been deported yet for his behavior. They coerced me into registering his car under my name, by yelling at me about how he's my father, and if I don't do this, I don't appreciate the sacrifices they made for me. It's *terrifying* knowing that a horrible person, who is here illegally, is driving around in a car that is registered under my name. I don't even want to know what could happen to me, if he was to finally get into a car crash, or god forbid, kill another human being. I am very close to canceling the registration, it's so scary.

My mom is extremely entitled. Because she's here illegally, she can't have a driver's license or have a car registered under her name. This means that I have to drive her around everywhere, because she's terrified of getting deported for driving without a license (so even if she had a car, that would be her excuse). It's no life having to spend 3-4 hours on the road every day because she wants to go here, go there, go everywhere. I have tried to motivate her to find a way to get a car and start driving, but it resulted in me getting yelled at for ""not caring what happens to her"". She has also defended my dad's alcoholic, perverted, and violent behavior over and over again - so the sympathy I feel for her is minimal, at best.

Furthermore, I'm expected to sponsor them for green cards in the near future. This means that I have to earn a lot of money (about $60,000 per year, I believe) in order for the application to go through (this rule exists so that legal immigrants are less inclined to go on welfare, basically). I am working full time at night, with plenty of overtime, just so I can submit this application. I can't work during the day, because my mom needs me during the day. I am also trying to go to college so that I can do something besides this manual labor for the rest of my life, but it's very difficult with how little time I have. I have a few semesters ahead of me, and my mind and body are about to give out. I have severe depression from having to live like this.

Lastly, they want me to buy them a house. They don't have the documentation required for the mortgage to be under their name, obviously - meaning, I would be the one stuck with thousands and thousands of dollars of debt under my name. I am trying to find every excuse possible to avoid this, for a variety of reasons.

I am freaking out. I hate this. I chose none of it. I don't agree with any of it. I make enough money to be able to just run away, but some part of me would feel extremely guilty. My reasoning is: They are adults, they made this decision, they dragged an unwilling child into it, I think they should deal with the consequences themselves, instead of constantly trying to coerce said child into illegal behavior. They also just make my skin crawl, with the way they choose to act. My dad is a horrible person that makes me very uncomfortable, and my mom strikes me as an overgrown baby.

Is it morally right for me to walk out, just to disappear? I feel like I'm going to go to hell. Is there anything else that I can do? I hate this situation."
Caught between my girlfriend and my band mates,Advice,1,di4uxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/di4uxn/caught_between_my_girlfriend_and_my_band_mates/,7,1571156948.0,"Last night my girlfriend of 18 months finished with me over the latest in a series of decisions where she feels she‚Äôs been our second best to my band.

My band and I have been performing and supplementing our income with music for just over a year on a consistent basis.

She lives 200 miles away, studying physics at university and doesn‚Äôt drive. She also doesn‚Äôt like attending the gigs because she doesn‚Äôt like to sit on her own or with strangers.

The straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back was that this weekend I had agreed that despite a gig on the Saturday night, she could come home on Thursday and leave on Monday with Saturday night allocated as time for her to go and see her mum.

Last week my bassist said he was trying to get us a gig next Sunday in Brands Hatch. A 7 hour round trip. I put a deadline on the gig and said if I don‚Äôt know by Thursday, we aren‚Äôt playing the gig.

On Friday night I was called by both and they begged me to reconsider as the company offering us this gig is Monster Energy. It could potentially change our lives as musicians. I told them that until I had an email with price and proposals I wouldn‚Äôt even give it any other thought. 

It should be noted that since being told of this gig I‚Äôve been having regular emotional breakdowns, knowing the consequences of letting my girlfriend down again and not feeling like I can let the band down either. I told the band that I didn‚Äôt want to do it to save my relationship.

My request was ignored and I received screenshots from my bassist, negotiating the gig through his own personal email and not the band email. Not enquiring, but confirming.

She has had enough and I feel like my band mates have shown a total disregard for any of my emotional well-being, I also feel like my girlfriend was well within her rights to finish things. She also said if I ever thought she could be my priority that she would be waiting (literally the saddest thing I‚Äôve ever heard outloud)

First time poster looking for some serious advice.

On a game a couple years back i met this person (we‚Äôll call him george) and we very quickly became friends after finding we shared a last name and other interests. George was always trying to call me and message me when i wasn‚Äôt online, and became angry when i didn‚Äôt reply. At first it was weird but no one else liked playing that game with me so i stuck by him. A couple months later and it got out of hand and i cut ties, we played on the same server so i asked admins to keep him away from me and all that. I was young at the time and felt a little bad but i ultimately had no other choice. 

After a couple weeks i met someone else who told me a similar thing happened with him and George and i was blown away, i stopped playing the game entirely just to avoid him. When my birthday came around George found me on facebook and offered steam gift cards, as a dumb kid i accepted and we became friends again. It was going real good we started playing all kinda games together on xbox, we had similar names and we even game shared. George continued being weird and i had to stop talking to him once more which only led to him getting extremely aggressive on xbox and messenger, calling me non stop and spamming messages. I again found someone who had similar experiences with george and even claimed his account was permanently banned by him. This person also claimed George was a pedophile even though George said he was 17 or so( i recently found out he was 20 at the time).
I didn‚Äôt completely cut ties with him in fear of losing my account which i had for a very long time and spent a lot of money on, i kept him at a distance for years and he‚Äôs been horrible the whole time saying that we are brothers but quickly calling me the worst person in the world for not playing games with him. 

I need some advice on what to do next, i didnt wanna make this post too long so if you have any further questions about things he has done ill be sure to answer.
And sorry for the bad grammar."

What do I do?,Advice,13,dhuah5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dhuah5/what_do_i_do/,20,1571104529.0,"I love my husband. I also love my dog. Most days we make a happy family and my husband and I hardly ever have conflicts like this. 

My dog is a two-year-old cocker spaniel who is well-trained, for the most part. He knows ""no"" and will listen when I tell him to leave something alone. However, the main issue he constantly has is that he doesn't understand personal boundaries. Or, rather, he doesn't know that when he jumps up, it can hurt. 

My husband had a tough relationship with my dog in the beginning. I had always wanted one and he finally relented. I paid for training classes for my dog and got them done and while we did have a problem with potty training for a bit, I finally invested in some bells for the door and that cleared everything up. I don't have any children so, really, it's like my dog is my kid. I do spoil him but he's very well behaved other than the boundaries issue. He's laid back and LOVES to be pet. During an argument we had a year ago, my husband confided that he thought that I loved the dog more than him. I told him that I didn't know why he felt this way but that I would give our dog to someone else if he felt like our dog was coming in between us. He stated that he wouldn't make me do that but that he did feel like I gave the dog more attention. Since then, I really have been working on that issue and it seemed like everything was going well. In fact, since we have moved to a new city, my dog and my husband have been spending more time together and my dog has taken to liking him even better than me! He goes into a FRENZY when his dad gets home compared to the tail  wags I get when I get home. I'm typically the disciplinarian and the one who gives him the ear meds that he hates so I figure that plays into the switch. It doesn't bother me AT ALL because I'm happy with the fact that they are getting along better than ever! 

That brings me to the issue that came up yesterday. We were laying down on the couch watching TV and my dog decided that he wanted to be with us, too. We usually are fine with letting him on the couch but this time he decided to jump on top of my husband who didn't have a shirt on and happened to scratch him in the process. My husband then proceeded to grab our dog and throw him to the floor. From my point of view, it seemed pretty forceful and it could have really hurt our dog. I get that it could have been a reaction from being hurt but it could have been handled differently. My husband then proceeded to get up and go play video games and went on like nothing. Later, I let him know that I was really disappointed in how he handled the situation but he just shrugged and said ""Well, he hurt me."" I told him that it scared me and that it really wasn't fair to punish him that way since we let him up on the couch all the time and our dog really just wanted to be loved on by him. *Not to mention that sometimes my husband lets him up and lets him lay on top of him while he pets him.* My husband knew that I was upset and decided to sleep on the couch last night. I'm confused as to how to handle the situation. Is it something that I blew out of proportion? Do we need to call in a professional trainer about the couch jumping and stop encouraging it all together? I'm open to all ideas and if someone has a great training tip for things like this, I'm all ears."

On top of that I took economics (thinking it was accounting) which would almost not matter if I wanted to pursue computer science and furthermore doesn't synergise as well as maths and physics.

Hence I was thinking of dropping econs as I find the ""there's no right or wrong answer"" mindset incredibly confusing.

She can be pretty self aware that this is something she does, but that's more a hindsight thing.

As a result, she'll often spend the time we're together complaining about perceived wrongs or being a bit confrontational about small things. I really like her as a person and see that these actions are a reflection of her emotional state rather than her personality, but it's still obviously a massive buzz kill and she can be pretty shit to be around.

While I have pulled back our contact a little bit, I think she's a dope bitch and have no plans to stop seeing her (unless the situation changes). How should I proceed in the future? She's already lost a good deal of friends from this, and I don't want to end up hating her.

A different person. I hate who I am now, I hate her, and I yearn for who I was. 

1 year and 27 days ago, I was 24, and absolutely unstoppable. I was highly intelligent, I excelled in everything I put my mind to, I never doubted myself. 

Everything changed after John attacked me.

Unprovoked, he threw me down onto the sidewalk and beat my skull into the concrete until bystanders responded to my screams. 

I haven't been the same person since. 

I think completely differently, I feel completely differently. I don't know if it's psychological, physiological, or both. But I'm not the same. 

The way I think .. it's not how I used to think before, if that makes any sense. I was a whiz at spelling, now I struggle. I'd never doubted myself before, now I never believe in myself period. 

I've been hurt before. I was raped a few years ago in a completely separate incident. Yeah, that was rather unfortunate, it was hard, I struggled, I was in pain. I could get past it though. And I did, I have. 

But the way John attacked me. I just can't get over it, can't get past it. He didn't only violate my body. He violated my mind, physically and metaphorically. My mind. The only place I've always been safe. But since he beat the fuck out of me, I'm not safe in my own mind anymore. Because its not even mine. My brain isn't the same and it's not going back. I just can't let go of that anger. 

He stole the girl I was. It's been over a year and my brain is still swollen. I could go on and on, about how much wrong he's done me, but the point is. .. he made it so I don't get to be who I am .. or who I was now, I suppose. I thought this feeling would pass. It hasn't. 

I loved who I was. I feel like he literally rearranged my brain. 

Life moves in one direction. Forwards. I know. 
I've been told i won't heal until I forgive him. How can I forgive someone who took me away from myself? Who permanently damaged my brain? Who robbed me of the person i was, and whom I don't get to be again? 

And is it really about forgiving him? He doesn't mean shit to me. Its myself I miss. And I'm angry that literally, physically, and anatomically, I can't go back to who I was. My brain just isn't the same. Do I need to accept this anger as a part of me now?"

I was talking to this one girl after the first two sucked and she was really nice. Our convo went something like this in the end.

Me: what do you do for work?

Her: I‚Äôm a photographer 

Me: oh nice you work for a newspaper?

Her: nah haha I do it for art and stuff

Me: ah neat, send some pics?

Her: of what.....?

Me: your art? 

After that it kinda hit me that she probably thought i was asking for nudes so i opened the app up again to explain myself but she had blocked me.

Fast forward to today, i recently started a job as a bartender in the town she lives in. The town is small and the pub is one of only three shops in the town. It‚Äôs a really boring town.

Anyhow i realised this girl was a regular here. I was 50% sure at first but then she mentioned being a photographer and i was 100% sure it was here. She‚Äôs really nice and i thought id would be funny to bring up this story for a quick laugh but im worried that would make it awkward.

I have now realized that Y might feel like ive played favorites but i don't know how to explain that i didnt/haven't. I am doing my best as a single father and just want help. 



AITA:



So i obviously have 2 daughters. Well call one O for older and the other Y for younger.


I have done well for myself owning my own business, and have about 80k for each daughter. O has done everything I ask and gone down what I believe is ""the right path"".(high school> college> job) and i gave her her inheritance at 18 because i think she can handle it. My other daughter dropped out in 10th grade, had a miscarriage because of drugs and has basically been fing up her whole life.

I feel like it's important to say, I raised O and my exwife raised Y. But that was Os choice, she didn't want to deal with her depressing younger sister or negative mom so i thought it was best to just raise O myself.


Now i think Y won't spend this money wisely WIBTA if i kept it in my name for a few years? Ill still give it to her but I want to make sure shell spend it wisely. I offered it to her when she was pregnant for a college fund for her child but she lost it so i didn't give it to her and she doesn't seem to notice. She works in a restaurant and seems to make plenty of money, even tho she asks me for money occasionally. O never does. 

Also if i do give Y what I saved for her, she will only get about 40k, because i had to pay for all of her ridiculously expensive mental hospital bills from when she was 15(which i dont even think helped her). Cost me 30k so it made since for me to take it out of her account since it was for her... My ex-wife is mad but I think it's because she wants to take advantage of Y and take her money...

I had to handle my own dead cat.,Advice,1,di4ctx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/di4ctx/i_had_to_handle_my_own_dead_cat/,1,1571153536.0,"Let me give you some back story.

I (21F) live with my parents, who can be awful when it comes to things that aren't about them.  They can be so fucking selfish and even when I try to explain to them why what they're doing is horrible and fucked up, they don't change.

So we have lost numerous pets over the years due to their negligence.  We've lost Cali, an old kitty but one that had obvious health concerns that they failed to confront with a vet.  I was in elementary school then.

Two of my kittens have died because they neglected to close the back door because they're too fucking lazy to get up and close the back door when the dogs go outside.  They were both hit by cars.  They have never apologized for that and even refused to get a new pet afterwards.

Then in 2016, one of our dogs had to be put down.  That it the only animal I believe they ever dropped more than adoption fees for.  He was my dad's favorite dog, I think that's literally the only reason they helped him.  He was diabetic cause my dad's a dumbass who fed him a shit ton of human food and didn't listen when we told him not to.  My dad's obese too, so it's obvious if he couldn't control himself he can't take care of his own dog..

They put him down cause he was having seizures.  But they spent about $2,500.00 on him prior to that to figure out why he was having seizures.

Then another one of our cats died earlier this year.  Their excuse is that it was my sisters cat, who no longer lives with us and is across the country.  He was spraying inside the house so they kept him outside only.  He started to get extremely skinny.  He got attacked by another animal and died in our neighbors bushes.

And now a cat who was the mother of one of the kittens that died is gone, too.  And it's because they're so fucking cheap, they refused to take her to a vet.  

How the fuck are you going to have upwards of 5 pets and not care for them.  I genuinely want our pets to be removed from their care.  I'm considering it.  We have now 3 dogs and 2 cats, one of which I recently adopted as my own cat, not theirs at all.  

My advice that I need is about how to cope.  They gave me shit about the fee to cremate Snow, the cat that just died.  She got outside the other day and we don't know what happened to her.  I had a vet friend try to come by and do what we could for her, she thought all it was was over grooming because she had fleas, another thing my parents neglect to treat.  I come home from work tonight to find out she's dead.  I attempt to dig a hole for her in the backyard, but with HOA, we couldn't do it just anywhere, and the only spots we could've buried her had pipes everywhere.. I handled my own dead cat. I had never faced a dead animal, let alone my own pet that I loved so much.  I cried so much, I'm absolutely heart broken.  I took her paw prints down with paint, I pet her, I cried and told her that I was so sorry, that I loved her, that she died way too young, she was only about 7..

I can't sleep.  I feel like a husk of a human right now.  I had to pick her up and put her in bags and put her on ice by myself.  I'm paying for her cremation by myself tomorrow.  It's $150 and I'm paying rent and for my own phone and gas and food right now.  I don't have any savings, I'm not at all in a great financial situation.  But my parents absolutely refuse to pay that amount, even if I chipped in.

I need help coping with all of this.  I am absolutely distraught and can't relax.. my anxiety is acting up and I just feel so sad."

Worried about her kids, and not sure how to get through to her or what to do.",Advice,2,di25l2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/di25l2/my_33f_sister_34f_dumped_her_baby_daddy_34m_for_a/,1,1571139885.0,"This is a shit show. The little details of this story are what are making it difficult.

My sister and I are close in age, and we were raised together in a house where my mom had a few abusive boyfriends and husbands. My sister and I never got along well, but we were still there for each other growing up. I've been processing this stuff for a long time, but I'm not sure if my sister took any therapy seriously until recently. She had a meltdown at work when there was an incident. As far as I know, everyone was fine, but she was told not to come back to work. She has a boy and a girl, 7 and 5. She still isn't working.

Over the summer she was in an intensive group therapy program. I was happy for her. She was a bit distant during the process, but suddenly afterward, dumped her baby daddy who she was with for about ten years. This didn't particularly surprise me. She was mean to him and took him for granted. Our mom worried about the kids but I brushed it off. Why stay with someone when you're unhappy, says I. My sister's the kind of person who does whatever she wants when she makes up her mind.

One day my sister comes over for a hair day with my roommate, a hairdresser. She's excited to hang out and talk about boys. I'm fine with this kinda crap now and then. She talks about some stuff she learned in therapy (lots of daddy issues, which the both of us enjoy) but for the most part she will not shut up about the new guy she's dating. They met in the therapy program. I find out a few scary things, but I let it slide. My sister's gonna make her own stupid mistakes. But when I discuss it with my roommate alone later, she's worried. She is wary. So wherever I would doubt myself, I trust that she agrees with me.

Cut to today, where she tells me that this guy has moved in with her and the children. I freak out immediately and drop all kindness I've been giving her til now. She is unapologetic. 

Let me tell you the red flags. This 46M:
-Was on house arrest for a year because of threats he made to his ex-wife.
-Violated the terms of his court order by talking to my sister while arrested, using a phone and the internet.
-Violated the terms of his therapy with her, because they aren't supposed to talk outside of the program. It's like rehab.
-Has told my sister to her face that highly emotional things she said in the program has made him reconsider himself as a father to his son. (MANIPULATIVE AF)
-Has a son who he can't see while on house arrest thanks to the threats, and continues to violate the court orders by seeing my sister in spite of that.
-My sister has also made statements that tell me he talks to her about his inclination to suicide which is also very potentially manipulative shit.
-Has known my sister for four months.

And now he's living with my sister, niece, and nephew.

My sister has completely ignored my complaints and advice, and may actually be the legal guardian of this man to keep him out of prison. (Since he moved in, I think either his charges were dropped or she's his guardian?) I cannot count on my sister to tell me the truth about any of this. I freaked out today and told her she was being an idiot, came home, and told it all to my mother, who has been beside herself with worry about these kids. I tried to keep things censored for her, but on impulse I shared all I had. We spoke to the baby daddy who, by his own admission, allowed my sister to do more than he was comfortable with since he was kicked out into the cold suddenly, and didn't know where to get emotional support. 

We're going to get together and talk about things tomorrow, but I know I'm going to be the guiding compass of things, because everyone counts on me as the cool smart one. I don't really believe we can get through to my sister, since she's already made up her mind, because she's weirdly protective of this guy, but maybe someone else has insight. I think we might need to talk to her in the end and say that we're not comfortable because we haven't been given any reason to be, now spoiling any positive first impressions of this guy for good. Maybe he really is fine, but she's just sold him to me with all these red flags. The best case scenario is everything is fine, but I don't want these kids to be in any danger. My sister can fuck up if she wants, but the kids need a say.

Tldr; My sister started dating a dude and is super into him in spite of a billion red flags. I wouldn't care if he didn't just move into his house with my niece and nephew.

M does have her own bank account without her mother on it but M's mother, on several occasions, has brought up having a shared bank account with M once she graduates high school. M speculates that this is so her mother can siphon money over time by asking for money for food and bills, or even just random gifts for her younger brother. Her mother even threatened M, saying if she didn't do this, she wouldn't help M with money at all. Lately, her mother has also been pushing M to apply to scholarships, grants and the FAFSA. She also asked M for access to said account with this money so she could use it. She even forced M into giving her the password for her FAFSA account as well.

M has asked her mother about getting a job before and her mother's only excuse as to why she doesn't is that she doesn't feel like it.

As he showed and told me the girl had been hounding and chasing after him for months but he finally submitted and let her come over to his place...she told him she wanted to have sex.

 Once that happened he calmly invited her in and he told me he felt a immediate sense of nope and awkwardness. He tried to have a normal conversation with her to clear the air but he felt a lot of resistance until she immediately just told him she wasn't sexually attracted to him because he didnt look or seem ""masculine"" enough. 

So he questioned her about this and she couldn't give him a answer other than say she wanted his body to look like Chris Hemsworth's cause she was typically into white guys. She  chased after him because he looked different and didn't look like a ""normal"" black person..;now my friend isn't buff like Chris Hemsworth but he's not skinny he's pretty lean and athletically built more so along the lines of Brad Pitt in Thelma and louise... and he certainly isn't feminine in attitude or cadence..she also said his accent which is a typical spainaird accent kinda sorta like Antonio bandera turned her off..its not high pitched it's actually really deep and smooth but she didn't think it fit him and wanted a more grittier ""tougher"" Black American accent (whatever that means) but she knew he was a forigener..that was the first time they met so my friend kept cool, calm and respectful of her.

My friend took great offense to what she said and it didnt seem like the girl understood what she did or said and why he kicked her out and didn't wanna be friends with her. Did he overreact or was he in the right ?"

I started dating my boyfriend about 6 months ago. At first it was great. I had gotten out of a long term relationship and met him on a dating app. He was sweet, caring, funny, took me on dates, and we had a lot of great sex. Then...things changed. 

We had both decided to quit smoking weed because we felt it was holding us back. He wanted to (and I believe still wants to) pursue a career in law enforcement despite the very frank conversation I had with him about his past drug use and drug dealing and how that would most likely disqualify him once they asked those questions on the polygraph test. He seems to think he can still get in, even though I had my ex ask his police officer friend about it and he said they would most definitely ask those questions and prior severe narcotics use would disqualify him.

We had been sober for months until he came to visit me with a joint. I thought, ""why not"" and regrettably decided to smoke half a joint. I felt extremely uncomfortable and paranoid after, and was so out of it I left behind my wallet in a restaurant. That experience reaffirmed that I did not want to smoke anymore, and I told him how uncomfortable I was and how I didn't want to do it anymore. He continues to smoke however, and every time I see him he's high. He has no plans to go back to school, no attainable career goals, he's doing nothing to help himself or take care of his mental and physical health. He will most likely be working at the same shitty job, living in the same shitty apartment for a very long time unless he gets his act together. He's also become distant and seemingly uncaring.

The last time he came to visit me, he was adamant about me taking a hit of his dab pen. Like, extremely so. I held my ground and told him I didn't want to. He kind of acted like I was weird, and said I was being a square. I felt like he wasn't respecting my wishes or my autonomy.

In addition to that, I've been talking with my ex, who is still my good friend. He's 20 years my senior, but that never mattered to me. In fact, I was the one who pursued him. Talking with him has made me realize I still love him, even though I do love my current boyfriend. My ex has a steady job with nice income, but he is a veteran with PTSD and alcoholism issues. We all have our demons, and I'm good at helping him fight his, and he's good at helping me fight mine. The truth is, I've never had a man treat me as lovingly and as kindly as he treated me. The reason why we broke up in the past was that I was extremely depressed and destructive, and he was struggling with his sobriety. However, we're both doing a lot better now.

I guess the advice I'm looking for is: should I break up with my current boyfriend? And if I do, should I consider getting back together with my ex? I'm super conflicted and I need an impartial party's advice."

current high school senior here, around january of this year my emotional state faltered and my ability to sit down and work on assignments has depleted. developed an eating disorder. never handed in my junior paper for english, never handed in the final either. skipped school when important shit was due and ruined my reputation with half of the teachers at school. currently at a 3.3/3.9, a significant drop from my previous 3.7/4.3. ive been meaning to take the SAT again as well but i keep putting it off, current score being around a 1180. two months into senior year and it hasn‚Äôt gotten any better. i‚Äôve completely isolated myself. i eat lunch in the bathroom. i skip classes because the social interaction gives me gut wrenching anxiety. 

currently i‚Äôm relying on obtaining a 504 plan (accommodations such as extra time on testing, assignments, etc) which i hope will help me survive for the rest of the year. 

call me stupid, weak, or whiny, but my issues arent something that some extra therapy will fix. i need a change is scenery of some sort. with tht being said i‚Äôd really like to use college as a means of ‚Äústarting over‚Äù. i hope that the new environment, the new sense of independence, and the ability to reset my social circles will help me with both the depression and the work ethic issues. if so, i would really want to boost my grades up then, and transfer out into one of my reach colleges in the city 2 or so years in with better grades and a better mindset (this may not even be the outcome, the school i‚Äôm looking into now sounds great and who knows, i might want to stay for the full 4 years). 

enough with the sob story, ultimately my question is how possible it would be to ‚Äústart over‚Äù in college as a high school senior with poor grades. if i do manage to improve in college, will high school be considered if i decide to transfer out? sorry if my question doesn‚Äôt make sense, i‚Äôm really desperate for any sense of hope at the moment."

Roommate Help and Advice Please,Advice,1,di3osu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/di3osu/roommate_help_and_advice_please/,4,1571149125.0,"I've never posted here before, but I really need advice. Today I did such a rude thing. Today in class, I was talking to my table about my roommate (my professor left the class for a bit). I was telling them that she has a mess on her side of the dorm. A classmate agreed with me because she's gone to my dorm and seen my roommate's side. I told that classmate ""the mess has gotten worse"" so then I showed her a video I took of my dorm. This isnt a video of specifically my roommate's side of the dorm, it's a video of me sweeping the floor, which I show my side of the dorm and then I show the other side. I had this video because I posted it on my private snapchat story for my close friends to see. Anyways, my classmate was like ""oh my god it's so much worse."" People overhead my conversation and they wanted to see the video. So I was gonna show the people that asked to see but so many people asked that without thinking, I put my phone under the projector and show the video. The whole class was saying things like ""that is so disgusting"" or ""how can someone live in that mess."" 

I used to think I was exaggerating when I said my roommate has a mess, but I'm not. She doesn't have a trash can so there's literal garbage on her side. Lunch boxes, pizza boxes, fast food wrappers, plastic starbucks drinks, paper, just trash. It's so much clutter that you cant even open the mini fridge. 

Anyways, one girl knew my roommate because they're in the same sorority so she texted my roommate saying what I did. Then my roommate texted me. She was furious. Saying that I'm fake and that I'm talking behind her back and that I'm being so rude. 

I felt so bad. I cried in class. I'm a very sensitive person. This one girl came up to me and offered me a hug. I didn't want to see what my roommate was saying so i passed my phone to the girl and she was telling me that my roommate has no right to act like that because she actually has a mess and it's a safety hazard.

I know what i did was wrong. My roommate said it was invasion of privacy. And shes right. But i do feel extremely bad. I know i should've just confronted her about it but i was too scared. I didn't want to seem rude by telling her i didn't like her mess. I've had a bunch of people tell me in the past that i should speak to my CA (Community assistant) about my roommate having a mess but I felt like that would've been rude.

My roommate has every right to be mad at me. But now I don't know what to do. She's mad at me. I can't go back to my dorm. I'm too scared to see her. I'm at my bf's place right now. And I know I have to eventually go back since all my school stuff and clothes are there. My roommate doesn't wanna see me and suggests me to move out since I ruined everything. But I cant really move out if I'm already paying for my dorm. I don't know what to do. It is currently 1:15am and I cant sleep because of how stressed I am. I swear I don't hate my roommate. I just really wish she can be more organized."

Yesterday I (16F) had my first math exam this year.
To put some context: last year I failed a lot of math exams and barely  passed the ones I did not fail, not because I was not studying, I rlly was trying my best.
This year, I promised myself I will pass math with a high grade starting from my first test. So I started studying a week before it, repeating and looking at all kinds of examples and for the first time I went to school confident that I will pass the test......if only I did..... the test was so different from what I thought, I knew the questions were gonna be hard and not based on just the questions from the book but also what we conclude from our knowledge. I tried to prepare for all of that but.....those question were so different from the book I felt like I did not study at all...and yeah...I failed the exam really badly, like not just under the passing edge, way under. I was so sad and disappointed I started crying all the way home. Today I have another test but I don't want to go to school because I feel like I am gonna fail it too, so I'll just do it another time (obv running away from my problems). How do I get my confidence back?"

I moved to Canada for university in December 2017 from the Middle East, and I've lived in multiple countries before since I was 17 years old to try and ""follow my dream"", but for some reason I got attached to this country even though you could literally freeze to death where I live. when I first moved I couldn't trust anyone at first since the reason why I left all those past countries was because I ended trusting someone a little too much and they would screw me over, but after almost 2 semesters (august 2018) from jumping to one group to another and putting a ""face"" to impress everyone, I naturally came to a group that I got very close to freakishly quickly and fell in love with this girl and we were both convinced that we were soulmates and had the perfect love story (which did not last very long) and I honestly have no regrets about all the problems between us because one of her closest friends became close to me and later she told me how she was madly involve with a guy in our group that was one of MY closest friends and had almost the same story as me and that girl. As time passed me and her became very close friends and extremely comfortable with each other due to the shared hate of people that we knew and could shit-talk about them all the time, and I have never in my whole life felt this close to anyone (I'm 21) and it was the purest form of friendship since both of us had crushes on people and there was never sexual tension between us. Her crush started to feel jealous of how close we were so he made her life hell by playing with her mind all the time and making her think there would be a chance if she waits. Fast forward to the beginning of April 2019, we had both been as they say ""fucked in ass by life"" and she had failed some courses and so did I and she couldn't get into the faculty she dreamt of going into. That lead her to be even more depressed and as my and her problems were piling up by the day, we weren't as close as we were before, we would hang out all the time but we stopped having ""deep talks"" anymore and the openness and honesty that we have with each other is one of my favourite things about any friendship. A few weeks passed and one day she called me and said she ""I'm outside your house please open the door"", and when I saw her she had a pale face and she was having a panic attack (at this point in time it wasn't about only the guy she was getting pressure from her mom back home and she was at rock bottom because she couldn't do anything about her degree at this point), all I could do was hold her in my arms and tell her that I'm here for here, I couldn't even tell her that everything will be okay because I would have been lying to her. As she was crying she told me that she had given up on everything and wanted to quit her job and has decided to leave the city and go back home for 8 months and start somewhere new (Toronto), I didn't believe that she was gonna do it so I told her that I support her decision and will help her out with everything. We got extremely close to each other in the past 2 months as she moved in with me because she canceled her lease and I spent all my time with her and we had a blast but I was still in denial that she was leaving until her last day. She refused everyone to come to the airport with her and we agreed that it'll be me and her only but the ride to the airport was tough, we were very quite and she was frowning so I would make her smile with a joke or lock our hands together and when we got to the airport we only had 5 minutes to say goodbye. as soon as I hugged her when she was going to the gate she started crying  (I don't know about anyone else but when someone I care about starts tearing up without making any noise it hurts me so much more). She left just like that, and on everything that I ever care about I haven't shed a single tear since I was 15 years old but as soon as I lost sight of her, I felt like someone dug a knife in my heart, a feeling that I didn't even get when I separated from my best friend of 11 years, I went back to the parking lot and as soon as I was inside my car, I started crying. she left 4 days ago now and since then I've had this feeling stuck in my chest the whole time, I can't spend a single minute without thinking about her and when I call her she tells me how much she is having the same feeling too. Now I know that this is how life is and I've lost many dear people to me (death, travelling, etc..) and eventually everything will be okay given that time will heal everything, but she was something else to me and I believe that I started falling for her and not in a relationship type of way if it makes sense. We were just talking today and she brought up the idea of me moving with her to Toronto next June and I really want to do it and since my childhood best friend and many of my friends from back homelike there I wouldn't have a hard time adjusting my life. The only problem is that I would have to leave all the friendships and relation that I've made here  and don't get me wrong, I would give it up in a blink of an eye for her but I am too scared to make a big move like that and I've already moved from four places around the world because I was never comfortable and I was finally comfortable here but only because of her.

I know that this post is long and it is my first post on reddit so please forgive me for not doing a TL DR but I'm hoping to get a third perspective on the story if possible so I would get an idea of what to do because I never had to make a decision that big for someone other than myself."

About two years ago, I was suffering from a very severe depression, which led me to various drug-related issues. Starting with alcohol, it all escalated up to the point in which I became addicted to cocaine. During this time, my older (and only) brother left the house and went to study in Germany (I live in South America, so there were not many chances to see each other), and, even though we had built a very solid relationship, he started drifting away from me.

I came clean to my family (parents and brother) in may of this year, and I had planned a trip to Germany to visit my brother for a month before he returned here (he did not do too well there, so his only option was to return home after two years), and, needless to say, they were not happy at all when I first told them. There was a lot of tension at home, but it all ended up in me going to the psychiatrist and receiving medication to deal with my addiction. After a lot of discussion, I was allowed to go visit my brother, and I got to know that he was now smoking, addicted to weed, and very manipulative. While being there, I met my girlfriend (who now lives in the US while I'm here), and I told her about everything. She was extremely supportive and was willing to be with me even in the worst times.

Now, I returned home in the middle of july only to spend about a month and a half with my girlfriend before she left, and, during this time, the relationship with my brother kept getting worse every day. Additionally, I relapsed without my girlfriend nor my family knowing, which made me start throwing out the pills I was supposed to be taking. My brother's attitude and addict conducts have gotten noticeably worst (I mean, REALLY badly), and yesterday we had a fight that almost got to the point of becoming physical and surely ended our relationship. Today, I was also told that my grandmother will probably die in the next month, and that made me realize a lot of things about my current situation.

Most importantly, I know I have to get clean from drugs once again, but I fear that asking for help once again when I was supposed to be on a treatment may lead my family and my girlfriend to leave me. Do you think that there is still a chance for me to ask them for help even after what I have done? If there is, how do you think I should do it? Besides, do you think that there is still chance to recover the relationship with my brother?

Thanks to anyone willing to give advice or even read this post. I wish you all the best."

I can hardly get myself up in the morning, and can‚Äôt stay the whole day at school because I just cant bring myself to do it. Yet there‚Äôs nothing I even look forward to at home. And on top of all of this, my school can hardly do anything to help.

And as for friends, I‚Äôm personally terrified of annoying people or disappointing them even more, so it‚Äôs hard for me to make any. I feel like nothing is going right in my life and everyone is disappointed in me.
 
thinking about all of this, it makes me terrified of what will become of my future. All I‚Äôve ever wanted was to have a family and have a stable job, but I‚Äôm not sure I can do it. I just really really really want to have motivation like a normal person and have people who care about me other than my family. 

What do I do?"

Anyone sued a company before?,Advice,1,di3bjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/di3bjg/anyone_sued_a_company_before/,10,1571146752.0,"If so. What was your story? Here is mine.


Vytas Juskys and his small business manage apartment buildings and are committed to constantly upgrading and making repairs to the homes of the tenants. He thought that improving their apartments and the common areas would help his residents love where they lived; he never expected that one of them would thank him with a lawsuit.
Juskys was in the process of improving an apartment complex he had just acquired when he learned he was being sued. He had been making a variety of repairs to the building and the surrounding facilities, and he was posting regular repair notices on the tenants‚Äô doors, as is required by law.
But one tenant claimed that these notices caused her emotional distress, and she sued Juskys for $500,000. The irony, Juskys says, is that the plaintiff had personally been requesting improvements and then sued him for notifying her that he was planning to make them.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way to avoid it,‚Äù Juskys says. ‚ÄúAt some point, if you‚Äôre into real estate, you‚Äôre going to get sued. We‚Äôre easy prey.‚Äù The lawsuit not only took away from Juskys‚Äô ability to focus on his tenants and the properties he manages, it also prevented him from initiating new projects, hiring extra employees and creating jobs."

Need advice about roommate situation,Advice,1,di3a7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/di3a7i/need_advice_about_roommate_situation/,4,1571146514.0,"I really want to kick out the two guys who are renting out two of my rooms but I'm not sure if it's the right thing to do or not because it's my first time ever renting out a room and having roommates. 

The first guy, I was giving a super cheap deal to in exchange for him doing the yard work (which he wasn't doing btw) until winter. The deal was that I'd see how it goes with him, and he didn't do the yard work even after I gave him many chances, and that was something I was willing to continue to give him more chances on, but I also don't like that his girlfriend has been staying over so often. I swear it's almost like she's living here. At first I didn't mind when she came to visit, because I really like them both. But then she started staying the night and I don't like that because that's more hot water being used. 

To be fair, I don't know WHO used up all the hot water this morning, all I know is there were 5 people in the house this morning, and there should only be 3. It's bad enough trying to get a hot bath with 2 male roommates, let alone when they have their fucking girlfriends over. 

Both guys had their fucking girlfriends over this morning, it was obvious both of their girlfriends had spent the night, and I don't like that!!!! I don't want that to become a thing. They both share a little bathroom too, so now that's 2 couples sharing that bathroom. I don't think that's fair for either of them. I mean why would either of them want to be sharing a tiny bathroom amongst 4 people????? That's ridiculous. 

As far as the other guy goes, the only reason I want him out is because I had this expectation that we'd become great friends and that he'd hang out with me, at least he made me believe that would happen when we first met. He was super friendly and nice and we hung out a few times. But as soon as he moved in, he became completely antisocial, quiet and kept to himself. And that's fine, I mean, I guess he's everyone's ideal renter, quiet and clean. 

But then he started watching tv in the shared living room every time he was off work, and he was just binge watching netflix for hours non stop, and he wasn't being friendly, you know, like it was like he wanted to be left alone, which made it super awkward for me to even walk past him. Once I tried to join him while he was watching tv and he just got up and left. I've tried to be friendly with this guy so much, every time I go somewhere, I asked him if he wanted to come along and join, and every single time he declined. It started getting to the point where I was realizing he really doesn't like me or want me around ever, but that is extremely awkward considering he's always out in the living room and now I don't feel comfortable to go outside of my room in the house. I mean I have no problem with him binge watching neftlix, even though I never get to watch it anymore, it's just the fact that he doesn't want me around with him, which is super weird. I feel like this guy would be way happier if he was living by himself, or maybe just not living with me, because I honestly don't feel like he likes me very much, and I don't know what I did. I've always tried to be super nice and friendly towards him. When we first met we had super long conversations and seemed to click and get along so well, so it's strange to me that he's become so cold and distant. It's really not what I wanted in a roommate. 

But the worst thing is now he's been bringing over his girlfriend, which has been super awkward for me. When he agreed to rent the room he was single, and said he wouldn't bring people over. And he didn't even introduce me to her, and I think she stayed the night because they were both there watching tv in the morning, when I wanted to use the living room, and then I just felt way too awkward because they didn't even acknowledge my presence when I went out there barely. I mean, I went up to her and introduced myself in a friendly manner, but he sort of seemed pissed off that I did that or whatever. I don't even know what he was thinking, but he just ignored me. Like usual! Anyway, it made me feel super uncomfortable and disrespected and I don't want to be feeling this way in my house."
"My sister wants the car my dad had reserved for me, I told her no, and now my family is giving me Flak for not being ""generous"" what should I do?",Advice,2,di0qvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/di0qvy/my_sister_wants_the_car_my_dad_had_reserved_for/,6,1571132694.0,"This was posted on r/AITA but promply removed for being a ""sympathy"" post, I apologise for the AITA Acronyms:

My sister and I are three years apart and my entire life had always consisted of me either sharing my things with my sister or her begging my mom and dad to give her the things that wer supposed to be for me. Back in 2015 my sister had gotten her driver's license and was gifted a red 2008 Mitsubishi. She never took responsibility for that car she always relied on everybody else to help her out with the car whether it be Oil changes or general tire changes or repairs. she was always reckless with the car and one day she broke the air conditioning on the car and as you all know having a car without air conditioning in Florida can be hell.We then moved to a city where the car had finally met its demise when she forgot to change the oil and the oil filter in the red Mitsubishi had busted the rest of the engine for some reason I don't know how the rest is all a sort of blurry memory but I do remember her being super upset about it she complained to my dad and we then struck a deal up with a very shady mechanic who then took apart the the engine and then one day without a notice he dumped it in a Walmart parking lot.

She then got a different car in then in my mother's name and then she forgot to pay that car off and it damaged my mother's credit as the repo Man had taken her 2016 Kia Forte. my mother was absolutely furious and told her never to use her name and getting 
a new one. My mom had to settle for an old 2000 Xterra. Now in the city the Xterra had broken down busted due to some kind of pipe or something it has a completely different story that I can save for later.  

now during this time I had struggled to get my driver's license because for some reason I was always nervous to call to take the test and as a result of this my dad had revealed to me that he had been saving this new car for me ever since 2017 and as I'm getting ready to enter community college my sister tells me that she needs the car more because she has a job, she has her University classes to attend, and she has all these other things that she needs to do in her own time.

so one day my sister comes to me and asked me if I could give the reserved car to her so that she can have it herself and I tell her no because I'm so worried that she is going to do the same thing with the other car I told her that now I'm going to community college and I have a new job that I need the car more 

She was irresponsible she broke the car in the first place she didn't want to care for it. My mom says I should share because that's what God would want.

What can I do? I don't want to say no to her, mostly because it's hard for me to say no, but at the same time I feel she needs to learn her lesson."

I receive my mail from the same mailbox as her, but it's under her name, so I'm not sure what to do. This is the only key we have. I understand normally how I would get a replacement - I would contact the post office, give them my ID, and they would give me a replacement in a couple days / change the lock. But in this case, the box doesn't become mine until I have death certificates to inherit the house. Which I can't get, because the box they're being delivered to or have been delivered to is locked. If I have her ID, could I present that and explain what's happening? I'm also her MPoA and FPoA (Medical and Financial Power of Attorney), as well as sole recipient of her estate, and next of kin.

I can't go outside without being groped, looked at, followed or called out by people my age and a lot older. It's honestly really scary and I don't want my baby growing up in an environment like this. My boyfriend who lives in a another state which is California wants the best for me. I live in Colorado btw and I want to be with him. We know our lives in become incredibly hard with a lot of stress on top of all the responsibilities. I don't know what to do because I want to be with him while I'm pregnant with his child but we live far apart. My grandmother who is my guardian absolutely hates me and treats me so terribly that I just want to runaway. She calls me a whore, slut, waste of time, space, money and everything in the book. She has threatened to send me away back to foster care or youth correctional facility which I have done nothing to deserve that and she always tells the judge on the phone daily that i'm misbehaving not following her directions and hurting her which i'm not at all. The justice system in my town is terrible as well and when I went to court a  couple of days ago the judge told me I was a waste and a lost cause that she was done with me. At this point I don't know what do in my town and I really don't want to be here anymore especially with my family. I would much rather be in foster care but in my boyfriend's state and near him so he can at least see me and his baby. I want to runaway and try to be in foster care there so I do as I said. If anyone has any better way to go about it or advice or something I would really appreciate it thanks for listening!"

Need Help with My Parents,Advice,3,dhyqm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dhyqm1/need_help_with_my_parents/,2,1571122984.0,"To preface, I am 21 years old, currently out of college and 2 months away from active deployment in the Air Force. 

When I was 19, I opened a lot of credit. As an ignorant teen usually does, I maxed out all of it. I tried to make payments but fell behind about a year ago. However, at the time I was starting the process of joining the Air Force, so I figured I would be fine as none of my debt was accruing and I knew I would be able to make payment plans with the collections departments. I'm sure some would ask their parents for help, but I was trying to distance myself from them as they essentially drove me from college. 

For college, I wasn't doing well and was really struggling to find motivation. I went to a psychiatrist just to see if maybe I had something wrong mentally. Long of the short, the psychiatrist said I was showing signs of Adult ADD. She suggested I get tested, however the test I was recommended required that they talk to my mother about my mental history. My mother proceeded to tell them that I in no way had not ever will have ADD, so even though my IQ scores were lower than previous tests I had taken, they gave me a negative diagnosis. My parents then proceeded to berate me for even considering taking an ADD test. So I didn't get any more help and had to stop school because of grades. 

Back to a couple weeks and I have received a ship date for the Air Force. With one drawback. My prospective job is Top Secret clearance level, so they had to run a credit check. In order to keep my slot, I had to repay ~$10k within a month. I immediately went to my parents and basically said I will do whatever please help. They lectured me and then made several rules for me but eventually agreed to help. The rules were essentially that I sell my car, move back home, pay them $1000 each month, and quit my current job to get one with more hours. The overlying statements to these rules were that I ""wasn't being punished"" and that I was ""free to come and go as I pleased"". I figured that even though selling my car and quitting a job I thoroughly enjoyed was disappointing, at least I was going to be debt free (they even said they would pay off my uni tuition which was $10k) and able to come and go as I pleased. 

Cut to last week and I wanted to spend the night with my girlfriend, at the house that I had already paid rent for the month of October. I started going to the gym before work and the travel times to the gym are identical coming from my house and my parents. I am paying my own gas. My dad was livid that I even suggested spending the night and said that if I did not return home by 11 that the deal would be off and he would reverse the payments he made. Oh, the debt wound up being settled to $5400 instead of the original $10k. I returned home that night and the next, and they still questioned me about where I was when I was in the room next to them. I wake up and leave before they do and return right as they go to bed so they never see me at night. After being questioned while being at home, I decided I was going to stay in my own house and sleep in the bed I paid for. I lied about my estimated time of return two straight nights and slept in my own house. They were absolutely furious after that and made the rules even more strict, adding that my paycheck goes to them every week instead of my account and I am required to sleep at home on ""school nights"". Again, I am 21. I understand that they made a huge financial commitment, but with me paying them back and them paying for nothing of mine as far as bills are concerned, am I wrong to want to live in my own house?"
Advice on how to handle some of the emotional/mental effects of stealthing?,Advice,0,di2xyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/di2xyq/advice_on_how_to_handle_some_of_the/,3,1571144388.0,"For anyone who isn't familiar with the term stealthing, it's when a man removes a condom without consent, or their partner realizing during consensual sex. I am only now just learning what this term means myself, and only because it's something that I feel has now happened to me. Apparently it's not completely illegal to do it either, but as far as I have read, it's in line with sexual assault with how it emotionally, physically and mentally affects a person.

About 6 or 7 weeks ago, I (30F) had casual sex with a guy (26M) I had previously known and I was very drunk. He was ridiculously charming and evidentially, charmed his way into my pants. Anyway, I needed to use the washroom before engaging in intercourse and I remember explicitly telling him to put on a condom, and he said ok. I come back out from the washroom, and he basically jumps me and I see the open condom wrapper on the bedside table, which led me to believe he had actually put on a condom. Like I previously mentioned, I was very intoxicated and I know we switched positions a few times, and I would have been able to see if he had a condom on or not, but I didn't notice. When he finished, he at least had the decency to pull out, and that's when the alarms are going off and I ask him where the condom went, to which he goes, ""oh, it's right here."" He picks it up off the bed beside him, and it was still rolled up, in the same way it is when you first take it out of it's wrapper, and it was clear that he hadn't put it on, just made it seem like he did.

At the time, I brushed it off, thinking how could anyone be that disgusting to make it seem they had put on a condom, when in reality, they hadn't. I knew he had a reputation too, so I went in for an STI check, later getting a call from the nurse telling me everything came back negative.

After all of this, I meet a really great guy, we hit it off and we've engaged in fully consensual unprotected sex. He came to me this week telling me that he's been having weird symptoms and went to the doctor, and the doctor is apparently 95% sure that it's chlamydia. Due to his sexual activity this year, he is very sure that it would have come from me, and I believe him. Test results haven't come back yet, but I feel fairly certain it's going to come back positive for chlamydia.

After doing some research, apparently for women a urine sample is 95% effective in coming back with a negative result when the patient doesn't have chlamydia, basically meaning that for every 100 women that have chlamydia, 5 of them will receive a false negative. I'm obviously going to the doctor and getting tested again.

I don't know what to think or how to feel and I don't even know if what he did can be considered stealthing, and it probably doesn't matter. I'm probably going to lose my new guy over this, even though he has been very respectful and understanding through this entire ordeal, but if I'm being honest the whole thing sounds like an elaborate lie to make myself seem less trashy.

I guess I'm looking for support. I've never been the type of woman to just lay down and take something, so if this plays out to be true, I had a false negative for chlamydia all because this guy couldn't wear a condom, should I call him on it? I'm also having a hard time with this, I feel so violated and I'm not sure what to do about it.

TL;DR: Guy takes advantage of me while drunk, pretends to put on condom and I don't notice until he finishes via pulling out. I get checked for STI's, told I don't have anything until I am approached by the guy I am currently seeing, who has symptoms for chlamydia, leading me to believe I received a false negative test result. Advice on how to approach the guy who did this to me? And possibly advice on how to handle this on a person level?"

1. I asked her if she wanted to stay together but mainly focus on ourselves
2. Take a break, communicate periodically, and get back eventually
3. Or break up.

She agreed to take a break. We want to improve ourselves first and come back together stronger than ever. Yeah it's a high task, but I really feel that this break is going to work. I admitted to her that my goal in the end was to get back together. I wanted to be upfront about it. And I asked her if she wanted to get back together in the end and she said that she does, but just wants us to work on ourselves first. We both said we're not gonna date anyone on this break either as we both are still very much in love and care for each other. **Anyways, is it wrong for me to think that this will help our relationship in the end?** Our talk was really great and our goals were made clear that we do want to get back together. Any advice is appreciated. I only ask this cause ""breaks"" are known to be another word for breakup, which I can definitely see why. I don't want to say i'm in denial, cause I really do believe that our case is different.

TL;DR GF and I had a mutual and actually amicable ""break"" talk where we plan to better ourselves and get back together in the end."

"I wrecked my car with no insurance, is my plan completely terrible??",Advice,1,di2v35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/di2v35/i_wrecked_my_car_with_no_insurance_is_my_plan/,13,1571143903.0,"I wrecked my uninsured car, is my plan completely terrible?

So I want to start this post out by saying that saying that I know that what I plan to do isn‚Äôt right, but my back is against the wall and I don‚Äôt have any other options. TLDR at the bottom.

Here‚Äôs a little back ground. 

I have a small commuter car that had insurance with a big name company for a couple of years. At the beginning of August, my policy expired and the premium had gone up $600 per six month period (due to two at fault accidents hitting a pothole-at fault accident, and hitting some under water debris during a flood in my city).  I needed more time to save up for the premium, since I had spent a lot of money on my wedding on the 31st of August. The 1st of September  was my last day to renew my policy and when I called, I was informed that since I had just got married I would need to rework my quote and put my wife on the policy. I opted to get my insurance when I came back from my honey moon, but due to the lapse in coverage I lost a LOT of discounts on my insurance and my premium was almost $4,000 for 6 months. I owe about 7k so that did not make sense for me to move forward with the policy. 

So I decided that I would look elsewhere for insurance, but procrastination got the best of me and I ended up letting that fall by the wayside.

On my way home from work the other day, I dun goofed and wasn‚Äôt paying attention when a driver two cars ahead (two lane country roads) of me slowed down to make a turn into a small dirt road that isnt normally used, and ended up rear ending the vehicle in front of me. 

I drive a small commuter vehicle and the other driver had an older Suburban, so my vehicle made impact (35-40 mph) right above the headlight and crumpled my hood. Thankfully and miraculously the suburban only suffered from a small dent on the bumper and not effected by the collision. My car was in a drivable condition and since I have no coverage, I went ahead and drove the vehicle home where it has stayed parked since the incident. 

I can‚Äôt afford to get the vehicle fixed, and I cannot afford to pay it off and count it as a loss... so I need to get creative with my approach to this situation.

I was recently referred to an insurance company that was able to provide mostly identical coverage for my vehicle and I just need to send over payment to begin the coverage on the vehicle.

I work in construction and I have people with heavy machinery who are willing to further damage the vehicle so it isn‚Äôt obvious that I rear ended somebody, but they obviously do not want to get their insurance involved.

I was thinking about trailering it out to my jobsite and having one of the guys back into my vehicle with a bobcat (skid steer, small solid tractor for those who don‚Äôt know) over the weekend and calling the new insurance company and reporting it as a hit and run. 

I have never been in a situation even close to this, but it feels like this is my only option to not go into serious debt for this accident. 

A couple factors to consider:

1) The new insurance has me on some program where I plug a device into my vehicle to monitor my driving for a discount. So after I start my policy I would imagine I have a very small window to pull of the stunt before I have to put the deal in my car and they would be able to tell my claim is fabricated.
2) my vehicle is dead as can be and I can no longer drive it
3) I can opt out of the monitoring, but I do not want to draw any suspicion as the policy is all but finalized

What‚Äôs the likelihood that this blows up and I end up worse off than I started? Is there anything important that I am leaving out? 

TLDR: I wrecked my car with no insurance and can not afford to pay it off or repair it. I have a new insurance company that I am about to start  a policy with before I have the trashguy I work with back into my vehicle to disguise the source of the original damage and call in a hit and run. The vehicle doesn‚Äôt run and I will have to put a monitoring  system in the vehicle so I would need to do it in the small window between getting the coverage and waiting for the device to arrive. Is this idea terrible? Does anyone have anything better or simpler?

Again, I‚Äôm ashamed to be in this position but I don‚Äôt know what else to do

"Should I keep my job that puts me outside of my comfort zone, or find a job better suited to me.",Advice,1,di2r86,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/di2r86/should_i_keep_my_job_that_puts_me_outside_of_my/,2,1571143274.0,"I've been waiting tables at a popular steakhouse franchise for the past few months and have been making much more than previous jobs. My only wait experience prior to this was a few months in a slow golf course restaurant a few years ago. 

The problem is that I struggle with social anxiety which can make such a socially-demanding job very stressful and has a direct effect on my performance and therefore my income. On the rare days I feel confident I do pretty well and can average 22% in tips, but days when I am filled with self-doubt I can be awkward & forgetful and can drop as low as 15%. I take a prescription for my anxiety and feel as if my anxiety fluctuates week to week; but as reflected by my weekly average tip %, I have been trending downward.

 I'm a full-time mechanical engineering student living at home. While engineers are not necessarily known for their charisma, I am also very business-oriented and would like to pursue entrepreneurship down the road in conjunction with the knowledge and experience gained from my field of study. 

However, the added stress of this job often imposes a negative impact on my schoolwork. A job within my comfort zone would look like something with little social interaction where I can just work and listen to music and maybe even be a little high to be honest. Unfortunately, these types of jobs are typically mindless, minimum wage jobs which would be half of what I make now. 

My question is: should I continue working a stressful job that constantly puts me out of my comfort zone in an effort to improve my social skills, or should I find a job more suited to my personality?

Please advise me on my life goal and passion of creating a good cartoon.,Advice,1,di2pzu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/di2pzu/please_advise_me_on_my_life_goal_and_passion_of/,3,1571143054.0,"Alright I probably phrased that weirdly, I wish to make a cartoon that makes people a better person while entertaining them and teaching them life lessons, not directly to the point it feels forced, but so reliant on the fact that viewers usually like to relate to the characters that it does it without my need to constantly bring it up and involving no fourth wall breaks whatsoever. That is my biggest and only passion in life. 

Now this is very different from friendship is magic, I want to be able to create a story that tells people from start to finish even the most 'weak' and forgotten of people can become widely loved and all around good people while not pursuing any kind of uniqueness or superpowers.

Yes this is EXTREMELY inspired from an anime called ""Mob Psycho 100"", believe it or not I was quite surprised when a few of my ideas were brought up in it too. It genuinely changed my life to the point I will literally never forget it and haven't gone a day not thinking about it for the past 7 to 9 months, yes, I love it that much and it hit me that hard, and I want to bring that joy once again to others because if it helped that many people, well why wouldn't I want to try to do it too while I was literally planning to do something that similar~?

Its exactly what I needed at the best possible time in my life. 

I feel as if mentioning I'm a weeb devalues my point here but all I'm trying to figure out is:

Can I somehow achieve this dream without having to worry about never shedding a single drop of blood? I know how protective cartoon companies are and I've never seen a non age restricted cartoon that isn't a comedy. It's not gonna be like 18+ level of things because I don't think even I can handle that ;-; but my point here is if you were to show a single fraction of any type of curse you will be thrown aside quicker than when you see raisins in a cookie.

Hopefully that got my main question across. Im just not even sure how they show anime in Japan, I'd be happy to learn the language and move all the way over there if that's what it takes. I try to get info from the author whenever I can, but it's hard because of the language barrier and how they are so secretive.

Also, do you think there are companies willing to put in constant animation effort and actually accepting a different artstyle? Dont know what I mean? Look how many cartoons consist of 90 percent lip syncing and talking, not even any dynamic conversations, and for the artstyle part just look at how many cartoon characters don't have eyes in their head and are usually perfectly round, I don't wanna have to bend myself that far. I'm not even sure if companies are willing to try new things either which scares me, too many factors that make it seem impossible...

Unfortunately I know this post will have very few comments even being the most optimistic I can, there aren't many experts on things I mentioned that will see this. Its just I know where I want to end up, and where my starting point is, but anything between I absolutely have no clue about and feel as if reddit is really reliable. It always is.

Sorry for the long length.

Thank you so much in advance, any kind of help is deeply appreciated, I need to throw myself out there if I'm gonna get anywhere~üíê"

I went to a party at my exes house in which I drank way too much and blacked out around 11(my friends said this is when I stopped responding to them).I didnt come to my senses until past 2, in which I was having sex with my ex girlfriend. She had also blackedout. We stopped once I mentioned that I didnt know how I got there. 

Im a victim of sexual assault and she is also. While I got dressed and walked out, she seemed to have been triggered by the experience and was having a breaking down. This has happened to me before when I was too drunk and thought someone had tried having sex with me when I didnt want too. I dont know how to feel or what to do. I dont remember how I got in the room or why I was even in there in the first place. I also asked my ex the day after(to check on her and see what she remembers) and she said she blackout around the same time I did and only remembered a discussion we had during sex. 

I wanna know so I can know what to do next, I feel like the monster I have dreaded and To hurt someone important to me in this way is killing me. But I wish I had memory of the night to see what happened as Im clueless

Edit: me and my ex have been broken up for 2 years, we talked every once in a while until recently she had contacted me while have a breakdown. Since then our relationship had been odd in which I have told her its best if we stop talking cause Her talking to me affected her boy of interest.

Having trouble growing up?,Advice,1,di2p4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/di2p4p/having_trouble_growing_up/,1,1571142899.0,"This might go on a little long, but I feel the need to explain my situation in detail to give you the best idea of what's happening. 

I (16m), have felt a sort of unease for a few years. I feel like I'm not as mature as the people I surround myself with. This isn't saying that I'm not intellectually mature, more in the sense that my mindset is very childish in my eyes. Most people my age that I've talked to or gotten to know have been involved in certain debaucherous üòâ acts and it honestly makes me sick to hear about them. I feel like I'm stuck thinking of my peers as ""innocent"" and I would prefer not to know about all the gross shit they do. I understand that lots of people my age are involved in illegal or otherwise ""adult"" things and that eventually I'll be expected to join them (I've felt some pressure already, to be honest). I've even tried to protect some of my friends from this ""adult"" content, they get upset and say that ""they aren't kids"" and don't need my protection. 

Another point I want to add, I find it hard to picture myself finding a job or doing anything productive with my life. I spend most of my time sitting around, staring at the walls, thinking about things that have happened or things that inevitability will happen. I have no motivation to do things I like for the most part. I want to go to med school when I'm older, but I realize it's hard work and I lack all the motivation. Even if I do become a doctor, it isn't really my dream job, I want to be a writer, but I (and everyone else I know) think that I need SOME form of monetary sustenance and being some half-assed lazy writer isn't going to cut it. My mother has been growing increasingly angry over the past few months, pushing me to join clubs or do other extracurriculars that I have no interest even considering. I would much rather sit around and get fat than do anything that involves effort. I'm ""one of those kids"" who never struggled in their early schooling years and was considered extremely bright and never had to study, and now that I DO need to put in effort/study, I feel lost. I can practically feel my mother's disappointment. Her star student isn't really all that after all. I know it seems like I'm rambling off topic, but I really do feel like this ties into the whole ""not growing up"" thing. 

I guess I'm really just afraid of growing up, but I want to know if anyone has experienced anything similar to this or if anyone has any thoughts. Any feedback is greatly appreciated."

While everyone says that you should just walk away and love your own life, I think sometimes it is healing to help others, especially if they are being taken advantage of like you were. It's true I hurt and I don't mind if this breakup doesn't go the way she wants it to.

If I turn her in, she only losses benefits if social security determines that she doesn't need them. I won't cause her to lose them, I will only get ssa to reevaluate her eligibility.

Besides the general turn the other cheek and forgive bad people for doing bad things rational, why shouldn't I do this? Or do you think it's reasonable? How else do people learn to not hurt others if there are no natural consequences?"
I do not know what to do,Advice,2,dhzsk3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dhzsk3/i_do_not_know_what_to_do/,3,1571127843.0,"Hey guys, first thank you for taking you time to read this stupid post i really appreciate it and, to give a little bit of background i am someone who likes to be on the phone or play video games all the time because honestly i do not know what to do without those, and yes i know this behavior of mine is bad but i am trying to be more social especially with college coming up. Anyways so i finished school and 4 months ago and now i am about to go college, so far everything has been going well expect well...family. Now nothing is like family, i know and i understand, but throughout my final year of school my family literally go and rant about me being a someone who just sits on his ass everyday either playing video games or just being on the phone doing whatever and not knowing how to come back home if i go outside or elsewhere and not socializing and having much friends to visitors, strangers and whoever. And well even after i finished school its still going, oh and a little thing about the final exams, i was first, sick for the first week of the exams ‚Äúit was for 2 weeks including the days off‚Äù, and second, while we were at home studying to the final exams for about a month or so, i had mental problems, understanding, remembering, memorizing and i came to the point where i forgot what ‚Äústudy‚Äù meant. My phone was the only source of me getting help from friends and watching videos of youtubers to make me laugh and keep moving forward. And i was always seeking help from friends and family and my friends gave me the hope that i needed to keep going on which i am grateful and thankful to all of them while my family on the other hand, they were basically like ‚Äúidk‚Äù. So anyway while i still finished school i didnt get a good grade but i got the grade i needed to get to a college i like and am quite familiar with, computer. And so, while all of this happended, my family STILL rant about this. They went to my cousins house today and i didnt go because i didnt want to miss the gym. So anyway if i lets say stay with my family while there are visitors and all most of the time they wouldnt rant about this because i am there with them, but if lets say i am in another room while i still can hear them they would be ranting about this, so they ranted about this to my cousin and their family and whoever was there. Now i really dont know what to do, i am planning to confront them about all this and tell them to stop because these things has become a part of me and we live in a day and age where everyone has phones and spends their time on it mostly. Its just i dont know what to do and i know these rants from my family maybe for my sake, maybe them trying to get someone to give me advice and help me with life and all. But its just people shame me for it and i dont know what to do honestly. Thank you for reading this and any advice is appreciated and sorry if this problem of mine is stupid and all but yeah. Again thank you."

College professor marking students absent for not doing their homework,Advice,1,di29e1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/di29e1/college_professor_marking_students_absent_for_not/,10,1571140451.0,"So I started college a couple months ago and I always do my homework but the rest of the majority of my class blows it off a lot. This particular time, I was 1 of 2 students that did the assignment so the professor was pretty mad. He read the first page of my assignment and critiqued it heavily on things he admitted her forgot to tell us about. It wasn‚Äôt a final draft though so no big deal. He had previously only explained part of assignments before and afterwards told us we didn‚Äôt have to redo it because it was just a completion grade. This time he didn‚Äôt specify for me to redo it but assigned a new two page paper that was due the next class. I spent hours analyzing my paper and writing it out trying to make it perfect. So I got to class today and apparently he decided just to work on the previous assignment and peer edit it. He asked me why I did not have my homework. I told him I did but he said it was wrong last time and assigned a new assignment. Then he asked me if I redid it. I told him no and he said ‚Äúthen you failed.‚Äù He told me to go to the back of the room with the rest of the class that actually did the assignment and work on redoing mine. I just let it go and sat back there and started editing. While doing so, he announces that he‚Äôs going to call roll. He says that if we didn‚Äôt do our homework, not to bother saying we were there. He calls my name and I say ‚Äúhere‚Äù because I did my homework, the first time it was due. Then he tells me that because I didn‚Äôt redo it that he was going to mark me absent. I was going to just let it go but after several people started leaving the classroom and one girl did part of her homework, then got marked absent. I decided to say something straight out, because I am not a confrontational person, I grew up in an extremely narcissistic household and don‚Äôt handle authority or confrontation well. So I tell him very calmly that he didn‚Äôt tell me to redo the assignment. He just said to write the 2 page paper(which we didn‚Äôt even discuss in class) and so he asks me what my argument was. I thought he meant for my paper, so I told him the argument for my paper but he stops me and says ‚Äúno, your argument is that I shouldn‚Äôt mark you absent because you need to be told to do something in order to do it‚Äù and I just froze and didn‚Äôt know what to say. He basically told me I couldn‚Äôt think for myself and needed someone to spoon feed everything to me. So he keeps asking me if I need someone to constantly tell me what to do over and over again. He just kept condescendingly asking me the same question over and over. Then he said ‚Äúyes, or no?‚Äù And I just shrugged and my eyes started watering. I started crying because he was talking down to me in front of the entire class so then he backtracked and said that he would mark me present being I ‚Äúlearned from my mistake‚Äù then he said that I was probably one of his best students even if he didn‚Äôt know my name. So he asked me my name to mark me present and never apologized or anything. He justified his actions by saying he was angry that nobody did the assignment. He still kept the other students absent. Was I overreacting in this situation? Can professors even do this?"

should I go to PA or Medical School,Advice,1,di27ba,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/di27ba/should_i_go_to_pa_or_medical_school/,2,1571140146.0," 

Hello, sorry if this doesnt belong here but I'm in some serious need of career advice.

I'm currently a second year in college on track to graduate in around 3 years, and planning to take some prereqs at cc. I have constantly been struggling trying to find my career path. I'm majoring in the life sciences, so the medical field is a definitive must for me, as it is something that I enjoy. However, I was scared off of premed because of all the horror stories I hear about medical school itself and how soul-sucking the careers can be. Because of this I decided that being a PA would be a much better option for me, granted it's only 2 or 3 years and it's some pretty decent pay along with a good work life balance, which is something I value much much more than money. I had been pretty set on this until I stumbled across a couple threads from people who work family medicine or primary care. Now, I know there is a ton of hate for this career path, which I do not understand. I've heard a lot of people say that it's terrible, hours are long, pay is miserable (200k, like what thats great money ????), however, I've seen some people who say that they are quite content with how they've ended up, saying that even though the pay is not surgeon level that their quality of life is pretty great.

Now, I'm stuck as to what to do. Is primary care really as bad as people say? Should I go into it as someone who mostly prioritizes work life balance and their hobbies? I know the path is still not easy, but I've been used to working hard and am pretty good at time management. I understand that I'll still have work hard, but that's to be expected."

INFO: I'm 13 and a guy

Sorry if this wall of words is confusing, and thank you for trying to read. I really appreciate it.

I \*think\* I have been dealing with depression for a while. There is a voice that keeps telling me that I don't have it, and that i'm just being edgy. I \*think\* I have known I had it since like, 9? I dunno just one day I was very happy outgoing and a really cool and funny kid than I just became so anti-social and would hole up and was super self concious and it killed my parents inside a bit, I can tell. I am so sad and lonely and I get sucked into toxic relationships and hurt people all the time. I don't think of myself as very smart and I worry myself sick about school even if its not a big deal. I don't have the heart to tell my parents because when I told my mom when I was 10 she cried for 2 days straight. We had moved to a condo at the time and that was very bad. My mom and dad fight often and every time I hear yelling I get so scared. We all have a decent to good relationship with each other, and that is good. If I get yelled at sometimes i'll be at the verge of tears, and its so embarrassing for me. I don't have too many friends besides at school and we're pretty much only friends because of school. They're nice people, but I feel like I have absolutely no one. I know this sounds really stuck up and I sound like a fucking idiot, but I feel like I am more mature than them. They still joke about poop and laugh about it. Of course a lot of the time i'm no more mature but in other aspects I just feel so alone. The only other people that age that actually want to talk to or that I have the courage to talk to are people online. I've met some good people but in all honesty i'm horrible making friends online as well. And don't even get me started on all the weird people that have added me trying to get something out of me, and all the people who I trusted who were strange and bad people to hang out with. When I find a new friend I kind of get really clingy and I never want to be left behind, I will always say wait up or something because I have an extreme fear of getting left out. I get a sinking feeling in my stomach when I feel like i'm missing out. The clingy thing I do is embarrassing to me because I am so annoying sometimes I feel. Not to mention i'm self concious as hell. Sometimes I will be doing okay in a social situation, and can do alright, but other times i'll freeze up and panic and stumble and fucking trip in my mind. I love video games and music. I know this sounds stupid and of course its been said a lot, but its a nice escape for me. My dad is actually the same and we both understand the fact we need alone time after school/work. I am glad that we get along on that front. I have made one or two friends from my music taste, and a lot from video games. But I don't have a lot (like 1-3 at most) friends online at one point. I focus all my attention on one person online and I forget about other people when I post somewhere to find friends. I am also extremely reluctant to share my music taste to people in real life, and I panic more than if I were to tell them a dark secret for some reason. This is embarrassing to say but honestly I kind of long for an S.O. I am bi and i'm not ashamed to say that, but for some reason I am to say my goddamn music taste but that is besides the point. I want an S.O but I don't see the point until at LEAST the last year of high school to try to find an S.O. There is no point because obviously 99 percent of the time these relationships fail and aren't even serious, yet all my friends have girlfriends. I dunno its just a desperate want for something that I know I will not get. I love to make people laugh too, but I don't succeed very often in it. When I do I feel really happy. I have online friends that make me laugh a bunch, and when I try to make them laugh and they don't or just let out a pity chuckle, I feel awful. Some friends pretty much only laugh at practical jokes towards me or occasional really good jokes by me. Everyone of my friends I feel is either smarter, more popular, or has some other one up on me. I am not jealous, kind of the opposite actually. I often actually wonder WHY these people would want to be friends with me. I don't understand it, because a lot of the time I think I should be the loner, or have only one or two friends. I've drunk before, and it was pathetic. I did it with some friends online and the times we did it when I think back on it now we were all so goddamn stupid and sad. I don't take good care of my ears by blasting music into them, my eyes look at a screen all the time too. I don't know what I want anymore. I know this also sounds really edgy and I sound like i'm posting a qoute online, but I don't cry often unless if I hear yelling. I will get so extremely sad (i'm actually really sad right now, that is why i'm posting this) and just not cry. I can show happiness well, anger VERY well (we'll get into that soon) and all the other emotions I guess I do fine. But I don't cry much anymore. It was a day before school started and I was so goddamn scared. I was shaking. But I just wasn't crying, and I worried about what was wrong with me and what people would think, what I would do, how smart I am ect. I get very angry when i'm at my limit and flip out, throw stuff and yell really loud. But I always cry while doing it. I think its not i'm as angry (even though i'm pretty damn angry to get to that point) but I think it might be my sadness coming out that way? I don't know."

TL;DR at the end.

...

I am 28 years old. Right after high school, I did about 2 years of college courses at 3 different schools. As I recall it, I did alright in most classes, bombed maybe 2 or 3. Mostly, I didn't have any direction or purpose and eventually stopped going altogether. Other than credits that I am not sure will still apply in any way, I got nothing else out of it (no degree or anything). 

Now it's 10 years later and I have a better idea of what I actually want in life. I know that I need to go back to school to do it and needed to make some lifestyle changes, so I moved from Chicago to the Treasure Coast in Florida to live with family. I'm now ready to get the ball rolling on school, but in starting to do so I find that I am at a loss.

My intention was to get back into a community college and pay my way through an Associate's in Science, then transfer into a proper program at a better university. I am as close to sure as I can be that I want to go into Physics, specifically to get involved with astrophysics. Barring that, I would also find interest and purpose in environmental sciences. Ideally, I would be able to spend some of my school efforts learning some of both fields so I could make a more concrete decision as my educational career moves forward.

As it stands right now, I started looking into the two main community colleges near me. One is Indian River State College and the other is Palm Beach State College. In beginning my application to IRSC, I came to the conclusion that they do not have a program relating to what I want to do at all. In fact, I did not finish applying because it required me to choose a course and nothing fit. I'm currently assuming that is a dead end. PBSC on the other hand *does* have a program for biotechnology and environmental sciences, but doesn't seem to have anything offered in the way of physics. I am going to apply there when I finish this post so that at the very least, the ball does indeed begin to roll, even if it isn't in the ultimate direction I need to go. For one thing, I tried calling to set an appointment with someone to help me through this, but I need to apply first in order for that to happen. 

My other concern with PBSC in particular, and finding a good enough school to get where I want to go in general, is how well regarded the education itself is. I don't see the point in paying for and working toward a degree that will ultimately end up not being worth it. I want to use this current venture as a jumping off point in my educational career, so I need to know that the school I start at will accomplish that. That being said, I have no idea how to go about researching that information or what reputable sources I could look to for guidance in selecting a school.

Ideally, I could get this first step (an AS degree) out of the way without having to relocate. I'm not opposed to taking online classes if that is my best option, but I have always been wary of ""online college"" because I feel like there's no way that traditional schools consider them as relevant. Maybe I am way off base there, I don't know. Staying where I am currently would keep the costs down at an in-state school now that I have residency, but that isn't as important as making sure I get the best education I can. If I have to spend more time saving in order to afford a better opportunity, then that's what I will do. If I ***need*** to move again to be able to achieve my goals, I am open to that discussion as well, but would be limited in where I could go. Chicago and the Boston area are both on the table as possibilities if it comes down to that. I would rather avoid another large scale move at this point, but recognize that one will eventually be required anyway. 

...

TL;DR: 

I'm 28, live in Florida, and I'm  trying to go back to school for physics and/or environmental sciences. I've been thinking school would start with an Associate's degree from a community college followed by transferring into a university for at least a Bachelor's degree. The school I was considering doesn't offer what I need and the other option offers half of what I was thinking I'd go for. I don't know what to do next as far as figuring out where to go and how to go about doing it.

&#x200B;

Key Questions:

1. How much of a chance is there that an Associate's degree from a community college in Florida will be regarded well enough to get me into a Bachelor's program in another state?
2. If I get an Associate's in Science degree that may or may not be tailored toward a field in environmental sciences, how easy/likely is it that I can successfully get into a physics program after that?
3. If I'm mostly set on getting into the physics fields, should I be looking for an an Associate program specifically tailored to that, or is an AS still more of a general degree that can be applied to any next step within the sciences?

How should i proceed getting my disabled abused grandmother?,Advice,1,di20dr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/di20dr/how_should_i_proceed_getting_my_disabled_abused/,11,1571139129.0,"Ok so, this is my first post, so bare with me.
This has been stressinh me out so much lately I've barely slept.
So my grandmother is about 80, very sweet woman and has only given her whole life. Well she was tired of living on her own, so she ended up moving back to her home town with her oldest son and his ex gf. ( keep in mind these people are 50+ with kids and grandkids, etc.)
Well with this in mind, you'd think things would be fine, but no. They don't even wanna take her out anywhere. My uncle PAYS his own kid to wash my grandmother's clothes, bed sheets, and even to clean her cat's litter box. They leave her alone for hours on end, and she's slowly losing her short term memory as well. My uncle's ex is also put as her ""daughter"" on her papers although she was never married into the family. She constantly has her 3 undisciplined grandkids around my grandmother, they scream and NEVER listen to anyone. They also negleted her to the point for about 5 days they smelled a bad smell, come to find out from my uncle's kid cleaning her bed, she had maggots infecting her leg!! ( she had lost feeling in her legs, but is still pretty mobile and gets around with a walker ok.) So she had to go back to the hospital, because of this, the hospital sent cops for elder abuse, shich didn't go far, but they now have a social worker. About a month after she had a mini stroke which thanfully didn't effect her to badly.. but she has been in rehabilitation since at a very kind facility. 
Well, i wanna get her and take care of her myself with my fiance. I'm 21 in my own house, and my fiance even has experience taking care of his disabled older father. So we have a spare power chair, and things to help her in the bathroom. 
Since i wanna get her, and on 4 seperate occasions she's agreed to live with me, everyone in my family WANTS her to since she won't be neglected by me and my partner. But since there's a social worker, and her short term is going bad, how should i proceed? I wanna just go over and ask her one last time, but i doubt that'll be enough.. also they do have temporary attorney of medical on her (a yearly one) as far as i know. 
So any advice on how i can help her? Since I have no experience with this.. anything would be appreciated.. thanks.."

Would like some opinions on whether I should ask someone out,Advice,0,di1yyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/di1yyc/would_like_some_opinions_on_whether_i_should_ask/,5,1571138931.0,"Hi. I want to preface my post by stating that I'm very incompetent at interpreting other people's intentions. It takes a great deal of courage for me to ask someone out, even when I'm presented with so much evidence they're down for it that it's undeniable. 

That being said, let me offer backstory to this. I used to work as a loss prevention person at a used clothing store. Always had a crush on one of the employees there. I quit this job last year, but still frequent the store because I don't like to pay full price for clothes, especially when modern clothes are often ersatz copies of vintage designs. Why pay 100 dollars for shitty jeans when I can pay 10 for a high quality union made pair manufactured in the US? 

While I worked at the store, I had to pretend to be a customer, and since I was operating in a covert manner, I wasn't allowed to speak at length to the employees, so as not to blow my cover. I never really made any connection with the woman with whom I was enamoured. For the first 6 months of coming back to the store as just a customer, we never spoke, maybe only occasionally acknowledged each other. 

Fast forward to about a month or so ago, I was looking through a rack of shirts, when she came up to me and struck up a conversation with me. We ended up chatting for a while, maybe 20 minutes. She laughed at a lot of things I've said (normally this would be an indicator in and of itself, and I don't mean this to sound arrogant, but my sense of humour is well received by everyone I know, so she may just have been laughing at something that was actually funny and not laughing because she's interested), seemed genuinely interested in the conversation, and I ended it because I needed to be somewhere and the time for that appointment was nigh. 

A week and a half later, I went back to the store, I've been visiting it more than usual because I lost a lot of weight and needed a new wardrobe. She's there, and we speak again for another half hour or so. It was late and the store was closing, and that was when we stopped chatting. She seemed pretty busy when we started talking, and didn't really do any work while we were conversing. 

The next time I went in a week later, she didn't speak to me at all. The following week as well, no acknowledgement. I didn't push either time, I really wasn't going to the store to flirt so it didn't bother me. I shopped and left. 

Last Friday, I went to the store, and again she seemed eager to talk to me. I had a pair of jeans I wanted to buy, and she insisted I try them on and show her how they fit. I did, and she encouraged me to buy them (there's no commission or incentive to sell, and her job is to sort the clothes into average and premium items and price the premium according to some preexisting model of value, so she really couldnt care less if I bought them or not from a job perspective). I told her I had to kill time as I was meeting someone in the area, and offered to buy her a coffee. She responded with ""I'd LOVE a coffee"", so I brought her one. We continued to talk, she revealed personal information about herself; the kind of thing you might discuss on a first date. Again, she never made any attempt to end the conversation or even leave to do another task, and she was consistently engaged in what we were discussing. As the store was closing, another employee made an announcement about having 15 minutes left to shop, and she playfully suggested that I ought to go to meet my friend. 

I'm getting to the point where I'd like to ask her out, but I'm still not convinced it'll be well received. Despite all of the indications she was interested that I've mentioned above, she never really displayed and body language indication that she wanted anything from me, like hair touching, or engaging with me physically like touching my arm. I know these aren't universal displays of interest, but  it's enough to make me doubt whether I'm seeing the situation with the bias of my feelings. 

Should I ask her out? Any suggestions on how I do if I do? Please be blunt with me if I'm being ridiculous and she's just being friendly and nice to a familiar face. I'd love to avoid the awkwardness of looking like a fool for misreading the situation if she's not interested. I really like shopping there and don't want to have to lay low for a while and miss out on good shit. Thanks in advance, I know it's a long read, but I'm long winded and I can't help it."

Since then Cece‚Äôs dog has done the same with the other roommates dog, and a 6 month old puppy. Cece also tried getting my gf to wash her carpeted room because she claims my gf‚Äôs dog peed in Cece‚Äôs room 3 separate times. Because my gf refused to do it Cece would talk shit to the other roommates and refused to talk. Now because my gf asked her to be quieter while she has sex her boyfriend, Cece has gone through a while campaign to lie about my gf leaving trash outside in shared areas, her dog still peeing everywhere, leaving dirty dishes, and refusing to clean up after her dog in the backyard. Because Cece complained to the landlord for who knows how long my gf is being given the ultimatum of ‚Äúbe a better roommate‚Äù and get along with Cece or be kicked out at the end of the month. The landlord emphasized the fact to do be a better roommate she needs to find out what to do better is to talk to Cece but Cece has been avoiding my gf in an attempt to get her kicked out.

Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don‚Äôt say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a bar job  myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‚Äòwell done‚Äô and ‚Äòvery well done‚Äô a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I‚Äôm a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise especially for only getting a bar job. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‚Äòohhhh....how did you apply for there then?‚Äô When Just before she‚Äôd give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk.

As you may know, it is college application season and I can honestly say that I have never felt so depressed in my life. I am a first-generation high school grad and I go to a very poor school that doesn't have many resources. My parents are none stop yelling and fighting everyday and my father has begun to resent me because he says Im just like my mom. They don't understand the importance of college and do not even want me to apply. We are also very low income, where the majority of our money comes from my father's disability checks. They are both refusing to show me the tax information so that I can't fill out FAFSA.

I tried to talk to my guidance counselor but she laughed at me when I told her my dream school. No one seems to believe in me or support me, and I feel so alone and lost. I know that my test scores are terrible and that there is no way I could get into my dream school, but I have worked so hard and I have sacrificed so much to not try. Reddit has been the most helpful community I have ever been apart of.

At this point, I feel so lost. I feel worthless and I do not feel like I am good enough for anything. I have worked two jobs through the majority of high school in order to pay the utility bills but my parents still think I am useless. I am depressed and everyday I just breakdown and cry. I tried to talk to the psychologist at my school but she told me that I am the valedictorian and so I am just over-exaggerating and she refuses to talk to me without my parents permission (they yelled at me for even asking). I have no idea what I am doing and I just want to give up. Please, any advice is greatly appreciated."

For context, I'm 18 and I have a trust fund coming soon from my dead father's life insurance.

My family and I recently became homeless because my mom was dependent on a monthly payment I was getting, which I aged out of once I became 18.

We're staying at my uncle's house and I've decided to buy a house for all of us with my money. It became clear that renting wasn't an option because my mom has proven to be very untrustworthy with my money and unreliable on making payments on time.

She discussed with me that the family won't be paying the rent in full because they don't make enough, therefore I would have to use my money to pay the difference.

My mom also planned on paying off her rather hefty debt to my uncle with my money without telling me about it. She had also asked to barrow my money to fix her credit score.

I feel really lost in this situation. I could not buy my family a house at all, leaving them to find something for themselves, but that feels too cruel despite everything. I could kick them out the minute payments fall through. I could buy the house and move out on my own leaving them to pay everything themselves. I could just suck it up and pay the difference, living with a family who makes poor money choices and manipulates because of money.

However, the last semester of school I seriously embarrassed myself in front of my professors and stopped going to classes the later half of the semester. (I dropped the classes and finished my last required course that summer to graduate). Basically, it was Spring Break, I got blackout drunk with two of my professors and was in a depression/ serious mental health spiral that caused me to cross some boundaries that night (apparently I threw up over my professors couch/tried to make out with both of them). 

That was two years ago and I haven't been in contact with my professors since. I'm sure they told the rest of the faculty in my department some version of the story, and I'm not sure if anyone in my department will be willing/able to give me a reference letter. Due to me not going back to classes, I backed out of some obligations I had with other professors because I just couldn't go back on campus.

Since graduating, I've radically changed my mental health. Started going to therapy--got diagnosed with depression/anxiety and ADHD which has changed my life. I feel like I'm in a much better place than I was but I'm not sure how to approach going to these professors who saw me at my lowest and asking for a reference from them.

Should I threaten to move states to get my older sister to treat me and my wife with basic human respect?,Advice,6,dhtiyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dhtiyw/should_i_threaten_to_move_states_to_get_my_older/,10,1571101440.0,"  The threat isn't an idle one, my wife and I plan to move to a little mountain town a state away, the threat is really ""instead of moving few years from now, we'll be  moving in a year in a half.""
  Okay, so, backstory time, about 4 years ago exactly, my now wife and I started dating in highschool and my mother and sister started being verbally and socially abusive to me and her for about a year and a half following the start of our relationship. With several instances of my mother disregarding every interest or hobby of mine as being caused by my Asbergers syndrome. After a discussion with her asking her not to connect everything I love and everything that I felt made me me, continued to bring it up but by beginning the statement as' ""oh, it probably because of your,"" then she would look me in the eye, smile, and say in this infuriating tone, ""I'm sorry""
  Both she and my sister would both claim that my girlfriend and my entire diet consisted of pizza, with many references to it a week. At times I felt like it was the only attribute they assigned to me in their eyes, just some sort of humorless caricature. My sister told my family about this and claimed it was a funny inside joke, causing us to never be able to escape this whole pizza situation. This came to a head when I got one if the highest ACT scores at my school, like the top five. My science teacher told me to use it as leverage to get something I wanted at home. I asked my mom if she would reward this accomplishment with refraining to refer to me or my girlfriend's diet, pizza or otherwise. This was met with ridicule from my mom, but after talking to my sister, she was finally on my side for once... for less than a day because I wasn't talking to my mom because I was understandably still upset. After hearing about it, my sister hopped right back over to my mom's side.
  Other things occurred during that time, like my mom poor-shaming my girlfriend and both of our best friends, her editing my resume when I was looking for a job to read that I'm a bad person and worker with no work ethic nor drive. This is all coming up now because we've since grownup (or so I thought) and have, in a way, compiled a semblance of an mutual, healthy familial relationship, infact, my now wife viewed my sister as a true friend, that is until last night where my sister said that it's all a show and that she still hates my wife for some unknown sin she committed in the eyes of my sister. And she apparently wants to talk about it and I plan to leverage the one thing I have over her, myself. Apparently she still loves me, her little brother, and feels that my wife took me away from her, while it was infact her leaving me with nobody to listen to me beside my then girlfriend. I am tired of the fighting, so, so tired."

I‚Äôve been reading, watching YouTube videos and listening to podcasts to learn how to save money.

I work as a tutor and mentor through a university program that provides individual tutoring/mentoring to students who request additional support. For context, I am female, in my late twenties and this student is in his early twenties.

I have been working with John (not real name) for the past few months. As part of my role and responsibilities, I usually get to know my students quite well. Throughout this engagement, I have mentioned to John on a few occasions that I have a long-term partner. Yesterday, John told me through text that he liked me. I told him that it was not reciprocal and inappropriate considering our tutor and student arrangement. I also reminded him of the program's code of conduct and that my engagement with him is strictly professional to support his academic development.  John has accepted this and promised that he will behave professionally from now onwards. As an option, I have also suggested that I would speak the the program coordinator and arrange an alternate tutor for him. However, he has asked me not to tell any one else about what has transpired. 

This is the first time that something like this has happened to me and as such I'm not sure what to do. I haven't yet mentioned the issue to the program coordinator. I am also unsure whether I should continue to work as his tutor for the rest of the semester, or just end the arrangement now.

I'm still not sure. Anyway - I've struggled a lot with sexuality throughout my life. I was abused by my mom when I was a kid, and for whatever reason sex ended up being this huge taboo for me during childhood. I was basically terrified of it. I think I only got over it at maybe age 15.

Anyway. Point is. My sexual desires have ended up manifesting themselves, once they actually bubbled up to the surface, in just awful violence/torture stuff. It really barely resembles sex when push comes to shove. I'm straight, and all I ever think about sexually is torture, dismembering, gore, even murdering men. And I really am attracted to these thoughts beyond what's healthy I think. Worst part is I've had sexual experiences before (never straight up vaginal penetration but pretty much everything else) and it did literally nothing for me. I felt nothing, there was no attraction at all no matter how hot the guy was. It was about as much of a turn on as washing the dishes is. The only thoughts that get me off are the violence stuff.

So do I do anything about this? I went to therapy to deal with the aftermath of the abuse but I've never been able to drive this stuff from my head. Can I, even? Am I stuck sort of broken like this? I don't know. If any of you guys have tips or have been in this situation I'd love to hear it. Thanks :)"

That's not the case though:

* I've been procrastinating now that I can't just skim past every class, so my grades should take a nose dive soon. I also have a bunch of contests/whatever to try to make my uni app look a bit better, but I'll probably fail all of them because I can't find the motivation to study.

* my friends don't seem to care about me all that much: they go out without me, don't really talk to me unless I talk to them, and they usually clump with eachother. I feel like a 3rd wheel in my friend group. 

* I can't seem to keep a hobby. I'd be really engrossed in something for a few days, and then I'd just lose interest after that. I have a lot of unfinished art, music, programming, etc pieces because of it. Because of my tendency to do that, I also find that I'm not really *good* at anything, just average/below average. 

* I don't know what I want to accomplish in life, and it's already cost me some opportunities. I chose to take one course over another because of what I thought I wanted to do, and now that may affect my uni apps (required courses). 

* I don't feel competent at anything. I don't feel confident enough to tutor people, even if it's in a subject I have high marks in. I don't feel like I would be competent enough to get and keep a job. 

* I feel like I'm mentally years behind everyone my age. I'm really disorganized, I don't know anything about fashion, I've never had a love life, I don't have a job, I don't really feel independent in any way. 

* My body is messed up and it's my fault: I'm getting cavities, it's been 2 months since my last period, I eat shittily at random intervals which throws off my body weight, I keep on forgetting to drink water.

She only sits at home gaming, she has two computer monitors so one has a game on it and the other always has her discord up. So naturally, I message her on discord. If I'm lucky, I'll get a response in 30 minutes to a few hours. 

I would understand it more if she did something, but she only sits on her computer either drawing, messaging, or gaming. To add insult to injury, she messages in the discord chats but doesn't reply to PM's. I've asked some of her close friends and they say that she does the same thing to them and that she sometimes doesn't respond at all. One of her friends told me to ""just have faith."" I asked him how am I supposed to have faith if I don't even know she'll respond and if she does it could take up to 24 hours or more? He just said ""welcome to the club."" He says that she doesn't reply because of anxiety or something like that but I think that's utter bs. 

People I know who are extremely busy with jobs, sports, schools, plays, etc. still respond to me within 5 minutes. The busiest person I know responds within a minute, at most 5 minutes. And they're out actually doing things. I don't spam her or anything, I send her one to two messages and wait. And wait. And wait...

This whole thing makes me increasingly bitter. I've now started waiting at least 30 minutes to respond because by the time she does respond, I'm pissed it took so long. It feels like she's ignoring me purposely when I know she does it to everyone. I don't know whether or not to bring it up to her because I don't want to sound controlling and tell her how she should or shouldn't respond to me, and just learn to deal with it like her friends do. I see this as a possible major red flag. How can anyone be in a relationship with someone who straight up doesn't talk to you?

I took prescription Adderall from ages 10-14. At 14 the side effects to my diet and weight became a burden and I decided to get off it for a while. I function well enough in school and went for a few years without it. Although within the past year, I have been having more difficulty focusing. I lose focus easily in conversation, while driving, while doing homework, and I seem to have a shotty memory. My biggest issue is reading; I am sometimes brought to tears because no matter how hard I try I cannot finish any of my reading assignments for English. I have brought up my concerns to my mom and she refuses to try to renew my prescription. I have brought this up to my doctor, but this angers my mom and from what I know I need parent approval to get the prescription. Despite all this, she still gets angry when I forget to do the chores she asked me to do or I cannot complete school assignments. Some friends have offered to sell me Adderall, but I would prefer to avoid illegal buying. Is there anything I can do before I turn 18?"
Advice for my (18m) relationship with my gf (20f)?,Advice,1,di0yyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/di0yyp/advice_for_my_18m_relationship_with_my_gf_20f/,9,1571133847.0,"

I have been with my girlfriend since I was a sophomore and she a senior in high school. I care about her deeply. However, I‚Äôm thinking a future with her would be an unhappy one. 

In the beginning, things were fine. In fact, I made more mistakes than she did. There was actually a rough patch a few months into our relationship that was largely my fault (no infidelity,  it was a lot of stupid teenager things combined with me not knowing how to handle thing in my first ever serious relationship). I have only been apologetic about every thing I‚Äôve done to hurt her feelings. Still, she brings up the past from time to time, out of the blue.

Aside from those few mistakes early on, I have been the best bf I can be. I have supported my gf through many changes (ie  going away for college, transferring schools, familial issues (neglectful father),etc.). We have truly had many great times together and I love her. She supports me and tells me she wants me to find my passion.

Only... I don‚Äôt think she loves me for who I am, and I may be partly to blame.

Ever since the beginning, I‚Äôve been the one to apologize. She would/ does get upset when I do things with my friends without her.. I‚Äôd always end up apologizing because I want her to be happy. As a result, I am significantly less close with all but one friend compared to having many best friends before the relationship. 

There is also a jealousy problem. There are many examples of this but there is one main recurring one. I had a female friend who I‚Äôll call Patricia. Patricia and I played the same instrument in the marching band, so we got acquainted but were not besties or anything. Regardless, my gf knew of her and had no problem with her from the get go. Fast forward some time and my gf is accusing me of cheating on her with Patricia because I forgot to tell her I drove Patricia home from school. So, since I didn‚Äôt think it important to tell my gf that I gave Patricia a 4 minute drive home from school one time, I was accused of cheating. This shocked me, because I am about as far as you can get from the jealous type. My gf legitimately hates this girl now and tries to ‚Äúforbid me‚Äù to have anything to do with her, even tho we share some friends. 

Another point regarding jealousy. Sometimes my gf will say things about other guys in a half joking manner expecting me to get jealous. I just about never get jealous about anything, and she takes this as evidence that I don‚Äôt really care about her. In fact, I just hate jealousy and what it does to people, and I have never been one to feel it.

Another time, she was very very upset with me and hung up on me because I liked her Instagram comment on my post and didn‚Äôt post a reply comment. She said I was ‚Äútreating her just like anyone else‚Äù. 

Oftentimes, I feel as if my gf is not being fair to me, yet I always apologize because I want to make things right for her. I really love her, but I think now that I‚Äôm growing up, this might not all be worth it. I‚Äôm sick of walking on egg shells every day. It‚Äôs gotten to the point that Im afraid to make new friends because it is very difficult for me to do what I want, and what she wants.

These are not isolated incidents. She gets upset with me at least once a month (usually more) with variable severity. I recognize that I am not perfect, but my friends tell me I am one of the nicest and most agreeable people they know (not humble bragging lol).

I want to emphasize that this might read like a rant but that is not how it was intended. I‚Äôm sure there are downsides to all relationships.. and I do generally greatly enjoy the time spent together when it‚Äôs just the two of us. I want others‚Äô honest opinions on it all.

TL;DR: I love my gf, and it would be great to stay with her. However, I do not know if that would be the healthiest thing for me to do."

I moved to NYC when I was 19 alone mostly running away from family issues... (i'm gay)

My parents wouldn't help with student loans so i waited until i was 21 to be able to receive financial aid without parental consent.

I took on a bunch of loans because I had zero idea what I was doing.   
Unfortunately I ended up becoming a party kid went out and ended up dropping out of school. 

I worked many a job but i struggled with many of them.

I got fired from retail because I was always late and couldn't maintain the store.

I got fired as a server because I couldn't remember silverware

I worked in medical administration and got fired because i charged  someone $53,000 on their credit card.

I have tried so many jobs and I honestly always fail. 

At the beginning it was because I was a mess and always doing bad things but in my mid twenties.. I'm 30 now...  I was sincerely trying but I honestly would always mess up because.. i'm pretty sure i struggle with ADD/DEPRESSION.

Things have also been weird for me. I've dated a string of successful men. I got married last year to a stranger from a European vacation (didn't work out) I have had an on again off again sugar daddy.

its not like i'm talent less. I'm pretty smart. I speak a second language (spanish). I have Traveled ALOT.  I'm currently a yoga teacher but still need my sugar dad to pay the rent.

He's actually a friend and i care about him. I Just don't love him and i don't think he actually loves me.

But I'm ready to be independent now. I'm ready to start my life. I Just don't know how. living in nyc is expensive but in my heart i can no longer have this man pay for my things. I cant go home to family. I need to pay down $6,000 dollars in student loans in order to start school again. I'm halfway through a degree in early child hood education.

I've been looking for jobs... but cant seem to find anything and Honestly I worry that i will just get fired again. I'm literally scared to fail over and over again.

I do love teaching yoga and I'm lucky to have a job teaching a few classes a week but I doubt that i'm good enough to make a successful career out of this.

I'm lazy but mostly because I feel scared and stuck and don't see an exit. 

Honestly I have no idea how this happen to me.. I just got swept up in a bizzare life and now I am ready to reclaim it.

Me (F21) and my brother (M16) have not spoken to each other for years and I'm pretty sure it's my fault.
Sorry for any grammar mistakes, English is not my mother tongue.

I was the first child in my family, my parents love me unconditionally and I'm grateful for that. When I was 5 yo, my mom told me Im gonna have a brother.
Fyi I live in an Asian country and it is still slightly that everyone prefers a son than a daughter. 
It was not that hard in my family but I still can feel it somehow. At that time everyone kept teasing me that my mom and dad won't stop loving me bc of his presence. It sounds so stupid now but back to that time I was completely convinced.

I guess I was jealous with my brother but I did not think about it that much. I dont remember exactly about my relationship with my brother after that but things was just fine. We are not too close but definitely not enemies. A couple years lately, my brother get into his teenage years and that is when things get conflict. I can not stand his personality mostly because I think he is the ""mommy boy"".

My family is kinda traditional and my dad is quite strict to me (we're asians lol) but then puberty hit and I start figuring myself, trying to be independent and then slowly stop listening to my parents. On the other hand, my mom was spoiling him, she's gonna help him with everything and does not give him a chance to grow up (I guess she does not want things happen to him like me)
She still packs his bag for school, getting his clothes ready, tie his shoes, help him with his jacket, etc... until now and it really annoys me.
I am not so sure if my mom's style raisimg him has affected on the relationship ∆∞ith my brother . I believe I have grown distantly from him which make us barely talk. 

We are living the same roof, seeing eachother's faces everyday but yet I still find it is unbearable and hard talking to him. Ofc sometimes we still talk for things like what's to get for dinner or if I need him to lock the door while Im leaving, it's just not the normal family talk. I guess he's supposed to feel the same way due to my distance to him. I mean I know I have already built a wall and it has led to him thinking that way.

And it scares me cause there is a part of me knowing him as my brother but I can not feel that family sibling connection. I do not hate him but sometimes I just have no feelings toward him.

"Taken advantage of by a ""friend""",Advice,1,di0trh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/di0trh/taken_advantage_of_by_a_friend/,2,1571133118.0,"This is a throw away account for obvious reasons and there are 2 issues I need help with the same person but I'm going to split them into separate posts. 

*PLEASE READ THE WHOLE THING*

I've (28) been friends with ""Lori"" (33) (not her real name) for about 10 years now. We met in the Army and although people warned me about her I decided to see how she was for myself because I'm not one to bully others off someone elses word. We quickly became friends until her medical discharge in 2009. We lost touch until I got out in 2012 and I had issues acclimating to civilian life (finding a job, paying rent, etc) and after talking for a few months she invited me to live with her and use my GI bill to go to school. I will always be grateful to her for pretty much saving my life( my situation caused me to be suicidal) but fastforeward 5 years and I'm having second thoughts.

Recently Lori convinced me to apply with a program at the VA which basically pays you to take care of a disabled soldier (usually a family member) but we got approved regardless. Now everytime I don't do what she wants she brings up this caregiver program and how I'm supposed to take care of her because I get paid to and she tries to fight me for money because she has poor money management skills and I used to until I taught myself how to budget. I only agreed to this caregiver thing to get her off my back. I've told Lori countless times to bring me her budget outline and I'll help her but she would rather spend money wildly and have nothing at the end of the month then expects me to pay for everything at the end of the month like gas, food, etc. She gets angry when I want to put money in my savings or if I don't want to buy frivolous things that would overdraft my account.

Her attitude has started to severely effect my moods since I've recently gone off my anti anxiety medication(no more refills) and am now self medicating with...other things. I have had to take care of my dying brother, narcissist mother and my siblings in my childhood without care for myself and I know for a fact I never want to be in that position again yet here I am. She has said many times how I've saved her life and she has no idea what she would do w/ out me (Ex: She tried to kill herself in a walmart parking lot earlier this year with a loaded gun but I wrestled it out of her hands.)

She also started a dog training business and put my name on it with her so that's another thing I can't get out of. Lori also owes me money(a little more than $3000 she borrowed ) but she wanted me to get the caregiver position and get paid because that was supposed to pay me back instead of her actually doing it. I can't leave right now because she took my truck without permission a month ago and trashed it( this is the second issue). She blames it on her PTSD flashbacks even though she KNEW driving was a trigger for her and I haven't worked up the courage to look at the dashcam footage because I just know I'm going to lose it. On top of that, the people she crashed into are now suing her for $500 in damages. I'm literally out of options and I've just been stuck in the house with her everyday because we live in a small town and you have to drive to the next town to do anything fun (I'm a full time student but took time off for my mental health but get disability from my time in the military).

I have this feeling that she'll kill herself or something drastic if I leave and I can't live with that but I also can't live with her anymore. I can just feel myself getting dragged down to my depression/trying to kill myself and would like to move back to California ( or somewhere with legalized marijuana because it works better than my anxiety medication ever could) but it's very expensive. I'm barely hanging on right now so any advice would help thanks.

*For clarity Lori has PTSD from her deployment to Afghanistan, shrapnel from being blown up and other physical issues( no missing limbs though which is a blessing). Mentality she has depression, anxiety and I think she was also diagnosed bipolar. She also suffers from hallucinations.*

HELP - I sent the wrong message to the guy I'm dating,Advice,2,dhxy6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dhxy6c/help_i_sent_the_wrong_message_to_the_guy_im_dating/,11,1571119539.0," Hi Friendsssss,

I've been mortified for about 6 hours now. I made the dumbest mistake by sending the guy I'm really into a voice message that was meant for my best friend. Let's call him John. It's about 9 in the morning and I'm on my way to grab my Starbucks while I'm recording some voice messages to catch my best friend up on my weekend. I just went on a date with John on Saturday and I was explaining to her how incredible it was. Luckily I had already sent her a few messages while I was on my way to work so she knew most of the details by now. All I was doing at the time was replying to her response. I sent 2 voice messages in total which came out to about 5 min. 

In these 5 minutes I mentioned:

\-My ex acting crazy by not leaving me alone. 

\- Planning to have sex with John in 3 weeks.

\-Planning to work out and get a Brazilian.

\-How great our kiss was.

\-""I hope this coffee I'm about to drink doesn't make me need to go poop""

AGAIN - MORTIFIED

After 3 long minutes i realized I sent it to my coworker I like instead of my best friend. I quickly reply asking him to please not listen to the messages. I explain they are personal and it was a total mistake. No reply...

Although we are coworkers he works out of a different location about 45 min away. The voice message haven't disappear on our threat and it doesn't show as ""kept"" so i know he hasn't heard them from beginning to the end. I panicked and i txted another coworker.. let's call her Nancy. I txt Nancy who works at  John's office to somehow steal his phone and delete my voice messages. She ends up speaking to him and he tells her he deleted the messages although he was very curious to hear them. 

SO now it's been about 6 hours and he hasn't replied. My question to you is: Do you think he went through and listened the voice messages? How would you react hearing the girl you just went on a date mention all those things? Would you walk away?

Go easy on me! Appreciate any feed back!!"

I've always been overweight. Basically since I was 10. It was because of a low thyroid but I don't have that anymore. I work my ass off and get a little but of progress. I started off dieting and exercising hard, and look a lot better. There's a big but. 

I tried fasting and immediately felt a lot better.

I've stopped using my calorie tracker because it says I'm eating 1000 less than I'm supposed to considering my high exercise routine, but I can't stop.

My mother and father don't believe I'm capable of having an eating disorder because I'm so high weight, plus my vitals are really healthy. But I exercise a lot and can't afford to pass out at work or ever really.  

I told my parents that the calorie counter said I was eating a 1000 less calories than I need and she told me to log that I ate a big Mac. She drilled into my head that being overweight is the worst thing I could do to myself and all my friends tell me as long as I'm not underweight it's fine. 

Am I being overdramatic? I've lost about 8 pounds in the last two weeks, is that unhealthy? I'm so lost and I have no one who a cares really. I don't know what to do."

How can I become emotionally/mentally independent from my parents?,Advice,1,di0qjv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/di0qjv/how_can_i_become_emotionallymentally_independent/,1,1571132650.0,"I originally posted this elsewhere but it has so far gone unnoticed. While I could've put ""financially"" in the title as well, I think becoming emotionally/mentally independent is the more pressing issue. Anyway, let's begin. I'll be as concise as possible:

I'm currently 25 years old and still living with my parents. I have the ""life smarts"" of a 15-or-so year-old. I'm autistic, but not severely, so I consider it mostly a nonissue.

I did not go to college, mostly due to the sheer amount of non-refundable money I would need to spend (yes, I'm in the US), and the time commitment. Also, it seems to me to be a gamble that may not pay off, and I just cannot risk that.

I never learned any important life skills during my formative years, either from school or from my parents. These include cooking, money management, basic maintenance, and others.

Before you ask me ""Why don't you progress?"", believe me, I've tried. Back in high school, I applied for a job at the local grocery store. They didn't contact me until it was no longer possible for me to work there. I went to a broadcasting school after high school in hopes of starting a career in radio. Frustratingly, there were no jobs to be found in that field, so I gave up on that last year. In the fall of 2017, I went to counseling in an effort to become independent. It didn't work. I got my driver's license last year in hopes that that would be my ticket out of the house. It wasn't. Lastly, at the end of last year, I applied to a fast food place fairly close to me. The interview went well, despite a couple of hiccups. I did not get hired. I still have never had a job.

So as you can see, every effort I've made to progress in life has hit a gigantic road block, as I see the people I went to school with living their successful, happy, independent, and sometimes married lives and having no such problems. I know for a fact that there is a happy, successful, and independent man hidden deep inside me, but I have no idea how to awaken it.

I'm getting teary-eyed as I type all of this. I'm getting to the end of my rope. I would never commit suicide, but I can't help feeling that I've lived all the life I can possibly live. I see absolutely nothing in my future, other than me continuing to stagnate with no way out. So, with that in mind, how can I become emotionally/mentally independent of my parents and start living my life?

Sorry that it got emotional towards the end, but this means a lot to me."

A bit of a backstory-- a co-worker and I started hooking up, I caught feelings, he ended things saying he didn't want a relationship. About two weeks later, he gets into a relationship and our friendship went null. Anytime we would see each other, we would avoid looking or talking. They broke up, he tells me he misses me and that he wasn't happy with her and that we should meet up to catch up. We never got together because I went out of town, then he went out of town. During these trips, we would text and he posted three love songs on a shared playlist. I was overjoyed because I thought these were an unspoken way of saying how he was feeling. Then I didn't really hear from him when he got home, and we had opposing schedules, and I didn't want to bother him. Then he posted a picture of him and his ex. A friend of mine, who had a conversation with him about why he broke up with her in the first place, confirmed they were back together. 
The next day, he texts me saying that we should meet up to talk. I ask him when and he said that after the wedding we were attending that night or sometime this week. I told him we could play it by ear. 
Welll I get to the wedding and he brought her. She was on him all night, while I was busy doing wedding things. I haven't seen him in months and it was torturous for me-- we didn't interact at all, even when standing right next to each other.
When I got home, and after doing some thinking, I sent him a video of me telling him that I needed him to know that I've only ever wanted happiness and love for him and that I was sorry I didn't show it to him. I saw that he opened the video, but he never responded. It's now been two days since and I had a realization this morning-- if I loved him, I would have just said hi to him and his girlfriend instead of walking right by and ignoring him while sitting in my hurt. I decided the fate of our friendship (ha) there-- it's over now. And I'm having such a hard time grappling it."

I'm living in Los Angeles, in the upstairs bedroom of a Korean womans home for $1200/month. I dont have my car out here with me and thus, admittedly and not-so-frugally, pay about $400 a month in transportation costs (lyft). After almost 6 months working here, I already feel a bit burnt out, and recently got upset with my college friend (also my superior) on a business trip and now my job is likely in jeopardy. My burnout feels partly due to taking a job that is not super rewarding (instead of pitching clients and forming strategy all day, I make sure I answer customer support emails and coordinate logistics (like shipping)). Many of my comments about broader strategy are overlooked or downright ignored. Working for my friend has shredded our friendship which in hindsight, feels like it never was that strong to begin with. Whether or not im fired in two hours for my labeled ""unacceptable insubordination"" on our recent business trip, I feel like it might be time to find a new opportunity.

The problem is, I dont even know where to begin looking. Before they offered me the job at the startup, I was applying to major gaming studios in the US in various marketing roles and got only through a few rounds of interviews at multiple companies. The reality is, I only pursued those because my most consistent passion throughout my life has been video games and I thought marketing what I love doing in my free time would be the answer to my career quest. I dont really know what I want to do as a career, and that's pretty horrifying.

I have money saved in a savings account that I'm afraid to touch, a loving family willing to take me back in while I searched for a new job, but I feel like a bit of a failure if I take that route. With a lucrative family business to fall back on but no desire to due to complicated family dynamics, I feel like I should find another job, trying something else, and not working for friends. I'd like to avoid dipping into my reserves too much while I look for a job but dont really know how much time to allot for the search. Should I mass apply or keep tailoring each one of my cover letters to particular postings? Lastly, should I be expecting a higher salary than 45/yr or is that my expected starting zone. If you made it this far, you're awesome, and thanks for giving me some of your time."

How to love water again?,Advice,1,di0bph,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/di0bph/how_to_love_water_again/,10,1571130525.0,"This is kind of a weird post.

I used to love water. I could down a bottle in minutes. I drank it all the time.

But, then I got cancer, and chemo made me vomit constantly. I refused to drink water during this period because bile/stomach acid + water = disgusting when coming back up.

However, now that I'm better, I still can't drink it. Even the thought of drinking water makes my stomach churn. And I hate it because I need to be drinking 2L a day to keep optimal hydration post-treatments. If I could just drink water, I could do that no problem, and I'm struggling with meeting the 2L with juice/soda/lemonade/etc.

I just want to like water again. Or at the very least not get nauseous at even the THOUGHT.

Also, no, I don't really like the crystal lights/mios. I've tried them before and they just... nah. Is there another option I could try?

How can I retrain my brain to like it again?"

i haven't been a collector since i owned yugioh and pokemon cards when i was ~11-13. sometimes i would think to myself 'if i ate a home i wouldn't need to buy takeout so i can use that money to buy more books'. and part of me thinks collecting books is filling that void

a part of me is telling me to just go to the library but i think it's so cool owning such an amazing book, plus if i don't buy the book now what if someone else buys it?

Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don‚Äôt say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a bar job  myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‚Äòwell done‚Äô and ‚Äòvery well done‚Äô a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I‚Äôm a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise especially for only getting a bar job. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me.

Me, dad, mom and relatives were waiting outside the movie theater doors to enter. A few meters behind us, I noticed a very tall man with a long blond beard and a cowboy hat on. He looked at us a lot, especially my mom, when she made eye contact with him, I saw that she was red in the face and she looked very uncomfortable.

The doors opened and everyone entered the movie theater. There were not many people in the hall, we had basically taken a whole series of chairs for ourselves, the man who looked at mom very much sat on the same row, he continued to stare at us. After a while my mother went to the bathroom, not much after that the man got up and he also left the cinema.

After the movie, when we were going out, I saw the man again and he stared a lot. Mom, dad and our relatives walked home because their house was close to the movie theater. I stopped and decided to talk to the man. I first greeted him and then asked what he liked about the movie, to be nice and polite. Then I asked him who he was and why he was watching us a lot, but I meant why he was watching my mom. His name is Anderson and he said he knows my mom, I was curious and asked how, he smiled and asked me to ask her instead, I nodded and went home.

I came home, everyone was there and had dinner, I waved to my mom and asked her to walk with me a little, she first asked why, because it was unusual for me to walk with her, but I said it was about something important, so we apologized and took a walk. After a while, I asked her who Anderson is and if she knew him, I saw that she reacted strangely and became suddenly stressed. There I realized it was something big. I asked mom again and asked her to be honest, and that I would not get angry.

She was nervous, I could see it. She then began to talk about Anderson. He was her boyfriend many years ago, when they were younger and studying in college. I felt something break inside me after hearing this, but I didn't show it so she could tell me everything. Mom said that after graduating from high school in Syria, she decided to study to become a lawyer in a college in the United States, that it was something she had planned since she was in elementary school. She said that she got accepted in the college here in Austin, Texas but that she did not know where to live, they did not offer her a room so she had to arrange one on her own. Mom said it was during the summer of 1990 when she was looking for somewhere to live, because she would start studying in late August. She had a hard time finding so she got desperate, and she met Anderson at McDonald's they were talking and then mom told him her situation and he offered her a room in his apartment, he would also study at the same college here in Austin.

Mom was unsure, she wasn't prepared to live with a man, the idea was to live with a girl or alone. But after thinking about it for a few days, she had to accept because it was her only chance. So she lived with him in his apartment. She informed her parents that she had found a house with a girl, she did not say it was a man because her parents would not allow it. After two weeks living together they started dating, mom said she was not used to live like this because our values ‚Äã‚Äãand culture prohibit such. But after Anderson flirting with her and picking on her, she admitted that she got intimate and started having sex with him and they got together. Mom explained to me that they lived together as a real couple, they hung out every day, went out to restaurants, went to the movies, etc.

She said that they were together for seven years, during mom's 4 years in college and 3 years in law school. So Mom said that in 1997 after she had finished studying, she decided to go back to Syria to work there, get married and form a family. She then ended her relationship with Anderson, she broke up and left the United States to return home. Then three years later at age 28th she married my father and gave birth to me a year later in 2001. Then she became quiet and begged me not to tell anyone about her past. I saw tears in mom's eyes and she said that she is very sorry for not telling me her story and told me not to get a bad picture of her, that she's still the same person. I looked at mom and just nodded, I was completely shocked, I never thought that my mother had been with someone before my father, it felt strange. But it was after all a long time ago, but I do have bad thoughts from hearing her story. It feels like I lost respect for mom, no one knows this story, neither her family nor dad, I'm the only one who knows.

We came to the US from Syria in 2013 because of the civil war that broke out in 2011, both mom's and dad's families came also with us. We've been living in Denver, Colorado but we are visiting our relatives in Austin, the same city mom used to live in with her ex-boyfriend, Anderson. After our long conversation ended we returned home, no one said anything about what we talked about. I don't now what to do with this information, how I should be reacting and if I should tell dad about it, but if I do that, it would jeopardize mom's and dad's marriage and relationship.

&#x200B;

How can I forget about her past relationship with Anderson? How can I see their relationship as something positive and educational? How and what should I do to accept what she did before?

Other questions I would like to ask about mom is, was it a mistake to have dated and lived with a stranger in another country, which led to a seven year long relationship, where she lost her innocence / virginity, she lied to her loved ones and that her relationship over there went against the values ‚Äã‚Äãand the norms in our culture."

She's currently 7 months pregnant and the doctors appts are starting to add up. She's a high risk pregnancy (thyroid) and although she looks very healthy, this means double appts because we have to meet with a high risk doctor as well as the normal OB. At this point we have appts every other week and soon, every week.

Her boss has been pretty agitated by the appts and seems to be getting worse. We schedule them for a specific day as requested and they usually start at 7:30am to try and miss as little work as possible, but after our appt yesterday, the boss sent an email and copied HR saying that working from home isn't allowed and we need a doctors note specifying all sorts of things (start and end time, purpose of visit, etc) from here on out.

My assumption is that the boss doesn't believe my wife is actually at the doctor and is building a case to fire her. I know we will have no issue getting whatever we need from the doctor, but is there anything else we can do to help mitigate the issue? She has good reviews and the pregnancy hormones + this additional stress about worrying how her boss will react to a doctors appt mean she is an absolute wreck and dreads going to the office every day.

I dont think any of this is illegal or unethical, but Im looking for advice on how to handle. My thoughts are we just have to provide the notes as stated, but i'm hoping someone else can share what else might help?"

Company got acquired and the acquiring company's benefits are significantly more expensive.,AskHR,2,dii3sh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/dii3sh/company_got_acquired_and_the_acquiring_companys/,4,1571218752.0,"My (small) company recently got acquired by a larger one. We're moving on to their systems, payroll, benefits, etc. beginning in 2020. 

Since it's a larger company, I (and some others I work with) was hopeful that this would decrease insurance and benefits costs. During the benefits meeting with HR, they listed their 2019 insurance costs and they're more expensive than we anticipated (so they'll probably be even more expensive next year...) . 

My company's health insurance plan plan (prior to the merger) calculated the monthly cost based on factors such as age, if you smoke or not, etc. I'm younger and healthy, so I was not paying a high amount. The new plan (the only option that isn't a high deductible) is almost double what I currently pay, and all employees pay this same amount. 

It's not like I can't afford it...but when I think about it, it's an extra $1,500+ out of my salary each year! Also, my spouse doesn't have great health insurance options where he works, so I was planning to sign him up for my company's plan - and I was floored by how expensive that was on top of just my coverage alone. I know that companies are probably less inclined to contribute to health coverage for spouses and families, but it's more than double what I would pay for myself and basically the cost to rent a studio apartment in some cities! Maybe that's the norm, but it really surprised me. We just moved to an area outside the city where we work and were excited to be saving more $$ due to lower rent costs...guess that's all going to health insurance now. I'd consider putting us on high deductible plan to save on monthly costs, but I have to see a number of specialists, so I don't think that would be cost-saving for us in the long run. 

I'm guessing I'll just have to grin and bear it (if the copays are lower than those of my current plan, then that's a little more reasonable), even though it's frustrating. Not to mention that the new company's 401K matching isn't as good and we will no longer have profit sharing. However, I'm wondering if there's any way to professionally voice this to anyone and perhaps have a salary increase considered based on these additional costs in addition to annual year-end merit increase and bonuses to cover the additional amount I'll now be spending?"

Getting paid to wait,AskHR,2,dii12u,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/dii12u/getting_paid_to_wait/,5,1571218384.0,"Hi Reddit!

I am a non exempt salaried employee and work at small professional services firm in Oregon, USA. Our firm only has a few employees and even fewer who aren't salaried, myself being one of them. Being a professional services firm, we bill our clients hourly and because of that we are asked to not bill anything if we are in between projects. This down time can range from 5 mins to 30 mins at a time but can add up to hours in a day. When we are between projects we are still required to be at the office and available to start work at any time, and should actively look for work while we are waiting to be given the next project. The issue is that if i can't bill a client then i can't get paid so any waiting time goes unpaid. This is tough because we are considered non exempt salary so we have to hit 8 hours a day and will be paid up to that, but once we go over the 8 hours we don't get paid for any waiting time only the hours we worked on client projects. 

I looked up the laws and found that waiting time is compensable. Would that be the case for a non exempt salaried employee too. To be honest, I'm fine if its totally legal, I just don't want to know my rights and frankly see if my feelings are valid.

This sort of thing seems pretty common in my profession but has only happened a handful of times to me, so I just don't know if its one of those things that i should let roll off my shoulders and only address if it becomes more frequent or what.

Thank you for any help!

My boss vs her boss- what to say to HR (California),AskHR,4,die1bz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/die1bz/my_boss_vs_her_boss_what_to_say_to_hr_california/,7,1571200668.0,"My boss (""Mary"") was hired almost exactly a year ago. She has never been a manager before, and had not worked in this department before. I started a month after her.
 
Mary is‚Ä¶ unprofessional at best, terrible at her job at worst. She doesn‚Äôt understand what our department does even after a year here, asks us to do everything for her and then spends all her time shopping online and playing on her phone. She‚Äôs also gross: she has applied deodorant and cut her finger nails during meetings with her subordinates. Her office looks like a hoarder‚Äôs.
 
Finally, she has lied about things. One example: she asked my colleague to do a project that her boss Ashely asked her to do, but told her to lie to Ashley and say she (Mary) did it.
 
Now, I have always been the type to just do my work and if my boss is incompetent just try to stay out of her way, which had been working OK so far. I just don‚Äôt eat anything that has been in her office and don‚Äôt really interact with her unless I have to. Say hello in the morning then barely speak to her, which seems to be fine. I just do the work and go home. I think Mary thinks I‚Äôm private but doesn‚Äôt know that I don‚Äôt like her. 
 
However, the two other people in my department that are in the same job position as me HATE Mary, and I've joined in off the record conversations with them about how dumb and lazy Mary is. Other than that, I just deal with it. 
 
Now, Mary has upset HER boss, (""Ashley"") who is our director. Long story short, Ashley has figured out that Mary does nothing and doesn‚Äôt understand our department.
 
Ashley tried to have a meeting with Mary in which she told Mary she was not satisfied with her work product, is worried she doesn‚Äôt seem to be understanding the department, and would like to see some improvements.
 
Mary freaked out, crying and yelling at Ashley that she has no support. Then she immediately ran to Human Resources and told them that Ashley is bullying her and has it out for her and she's ""uncomfortable.""
 
Ashley was told by her boss ‚ÄúJohn‚Äù that she needed to CC him on all communications with Mary from now on, and that she needs to be more gentle with Mary and try to help her get up to speed. He also said that he feels like Mary is not great but since she went to HR first she has the upper hand here.
 
Now, Ashley‚Äôs boss John has sent an invite to all of us (except for Mary) to meet one-on-one to ask about how we feel about Mary.
 
My gut reaction is to say nothing about ANYONE, and not to take sides. Play dumb and only talk about my work.
 
However, I've put myself in a bad spot because everyone else hates Mary and our department is very small‚Ä¶ if I don't say anything bad about her, I'm afraid my equals and Mary's boss Ashley will hear through the grapevine and get pissed that I seemed to be on their side and then went all Switzerland on them when push came to shove.

What would you do? Hope that since everyone in the department has negative interactions with Mary and if we all say it she‚Äôll get reprimanded? Or stay quiet and hope it doesn‚Äôt get back to anyone? I know this company, and I get the vibe that nothing will stay a secret even if HR tries. I‚Äôm really stuck here.
 
Also, if I DO say something about my boss Mary, I have documented emails and IM‚Äôs of times I perceived her to be unprofessional/incompetent. Should I keep that a secret or bring that all out? I am not the only one documenting. My colleagues have been doing this as well.

The problem is I work very closely with colleagues and customers on the food counters handling and preparing food for customers.
 So now I'm forced to choose wether to follow store policy (and break food safety laws in the UK) and risk making the public and colleagues sick by touching other people's food whilst being physically sick hours before. 
 Or follow food safety laws for the UK (and break store policies) and not return to work until 24 hours have past since I was last physically sick, but if I follow the food safety law I risk loosing my job, as I got told at my last meeting if I'm off at any point till June 2020 I will be on a final warning.
 Can I get sacked for following food safety laws? And if I do, do I have a case to appeal/get compensation from it?? 
 I have no idea who to talk to about this as we have no HR at my store,No union rep and all the mangers are brown nosing the store manager and will do anything to assert their dominance over colleague's, and if you ask about this kind of problem they either reply with don't be sick then, it sounds like your problem or something similar.

Corp HR Won‚Äôt Terminate,AskHR,3,dieb1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/dieb1v/corp_hr_wont_terminate/,8,1571201744.0,"Oakland County, Michigan. (Sorry for the book)


I work for a large hotel company in a corporately managed investment company owned property. We have around 20 employees and are structured Assistant General Manager and Sales Director report directly to the General Manager, who reports to a regional director, and further up. The general manager had been on property over 20 years with no previous HR issues, in fact we are referred to as ‚Äúit‚Äôs all rainbows and unicorns at property‚Äù by corporate due to our lack of issues with well, anything. Our average staff member has been with us between three and four years and we have the lowest turnover rate in over 300 properties. We are a strong team and work with each other to lift each other up.


Recently a new sales director(sd) was hired without input from the property, the corporate floating sales director did not agree with her hiring, she did not believe the candidate would be a good fit for the team, she was hired anyways.


She is not a good fit, within her first two weeks, she referred to the housekeepers as ‚Äúthe help,‚Äù threw away a clearly labeled box of personal (but work) items belonging to the general manager, and refused to sell the property or hold tours as she felt the hotel was dirty and fun down. The 9.5/10 cleanliness scores obviously dispute that. When tours were booked, most stated that they knew SD for years, had brief tours and were taken to expensive ($50+ for two people) lunches and did not book any business. 


The SD states that her job is to sell the hotel and not make friends and does not return simple greetings of hello or good morning from guests or staff. When all team lunches were held, SD would take food and go into office and close door. SD also speaks negatively in regards to property and upkeep in emails to AGM and GM. Nothing positive is ever mentioned, only reasons why not. 


GM attempted to speak to SD after 3 weeks and SD not knowing staff names, and issues mentioned above. SD stated that GM was not her boss and refused to let GM speak, would not sign document of issues and expected resolutions. Corp HR stepped in to handle situation via phone call and it slightly improved. SD even bought gifts for housekeeping staff celebration. Now knows 50% of staff‚Äôs names (two months later).


AGM reaches out to corporate HR stating that they were at wits end, had been trying to view situation as black and white, rather than personal, and could no longer do so. Was very unhappy and felt that workplace had been completely turned negative like there was an elephant in the room whenever SD was present. HR asked what resolution AGM wanted and they stated to protect their team, that they were unhappy and described SD as dark cloud constantly bringing the staff down, simply by being there and not interacting with them positively or at all. HR said would reach out to GM and work for solution.


HR reached out to GM and stated what was said, GM also added comments and observations from additional staff members. Stated that they did not think SD would change and get that parting ways was best solution. HR said would bring up to their manager as when managers are terminated it requires additional approval.


HR responded that a ‚Äòcultural difference‚Äô and ‚Äòpersonality‚Äô were not enough reason to terminate a manager, even within their 90 days without fear of litigation. That current issues would not stand up in court and non-performance was really only way to terminate a manager. Told GM to try to use corrective behavior, when SD does not say hello, speak to her privately ‚Äúare you having a rough morning, housekeeper said hello and you just walked past her,‚Äù and to make excuses that SD might be having a bad day to staff. GM objected that she did not want to lie to her staff and make excuses. HR stated as manager, it was her job to correct the situation. That they will touch base back in a week.


Staff feels that an uncomfortable hostile workplace where everyone is walking on eggshells has been created, what more can be done to show HR this person is not a good fit before team begins to break apart and quit?"

I asked what the new package would be and was told there would be no change. I understand I am not entitled to this. Issue is that I then asked what would happen if I was content with my current role and my manager heavily implied that I would be be referred to HR to be dismissed. His reasoning was that I am not fully utilised and the changes are not large enough to require consultation. His arguments for me having additional time to spare was because I take my contractual lunch breaks, mostly leave on time and work from home occasionally (on a flexible working scheme for health reasons). 

My questions are:

1. Should I be consulted on the above changes and offered redundancy if I do not want the new role and my current job will no longer exist?

Interviewed for a job. Company has since added me to other applications in their system?,AskHR,4,di9vh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/di9vh9/interviewed_for_a_job_company_has_since_added_me/,5,1571183740.0,"Location: Southern US

So I had an interview a week ago that I thought went really well. I interviewed for an hour with the team I'd be working with and then met briefly with the hiring manager who gave me all of the info related to the company's benefits, PTO, etc. The hiring manager also said I should hear something in 1-2 weeks. Today marks a week and I have yet to hear anything from them.

What I have noticed, though, is that on their career application system website I have since been added to 2 other job applications, both of which are identical to the one I interviewed for only with different posting dates and requisition numbers. The entire description for both are the same which are also identical to the position I interviewed‚Äã for. The only difference is the one I actually applied for will let me go back and review the application I submitted, whereas the other two only give me the option to go back and review the job description. This suggests to me I was intentionally added to those jobs by the company, but I can't figure out why. I'm hoping it's a good sign, though. Does anyone here have any insight? Any input is greatly appreciated"

Excessive meaning 4+ times in a 5 hour shift, not including their 15 minute break.

New to this sub (and new account for anonymity).

I work in a startup in Michigan that focuses on mobility (very broad term, I know). One of my responsibilities is to set up some sort of commuting program for our employees to use, but this is a new experience to me. We don't really have a specific definition for ""commute program"", so it could be anything from using an service like RideAmigos, building an internal tool, or even just writing a basic commute policy. I wanted to connect with some HR professionals who may have done something like this to learn what you did, why you did it, what works/doesn't work, etc.

I'd like to keep this question open-ended enough so that people can share some of their experiences and programs they have or tried in the past. I would appreciate any responses here, but also if you prefer (or have the time) to talk then I'd love to set up a call and happy to compensate you for your time with a $20 Amazon giftcard.

Apologies in advance if this breaks any sub rules, I'm just trying to get best practices or lessons learned from people who have done this before, but I guess this can also be seen as breaking rule 5. If that's the case let me know and I'll take this post down."

I told my manager and asked to file a formal report.  He talked to him and told him thats not allowed and told me he was asking hr for guidance.

That was on a friday.  The next Tuesday he smelled like alcohol so I asked a coworker to confirm, reported it to my manager and he said he couldn't tell.

Then last week I found him asleep again, so I brought another coworker(upper management) who was walking by to witness this.  He shrugged it off but later reported it to my main boss.

Employment terminated without good reason during probation period.,AskHR,58,dhydrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/dhydrx/employment_terminated_without_good_reason_during/,42,1571121424.0,"I have been working at a large financial service institution for four months. My probation period is six months. 

Originally, I worked under the supervision of a senior associate. Initially, I liked him because he was polite and academic. Then, I began to see other facets to his character. 

He struggled to explain concepts clearly, and would frequently change his instructions (after I had completed the task). However, I asked a lot of follow-up questions and believe that my work was of a good standard. Not once did he criticise my work, although I repeatedly asked for feedback. 

Further, he clearly had problems with women. He was reprimanded- but not dismissed- for groping a secretary whilst drunk. Others noticed that he would only work with quiet, submissive women. 

I am neither quiet nor submissive, and I believe that he was uncomfortable with this. Gradually, he stopped giving me work. So I started working on other projects, and no one has ever questioned my competency. 

On Friday, HR called me into a meeting indicating that I would not pass my probationary period as the senior associate said I could not take instructions. I encouraged them to speak to other employees. An investigation was conducted, but my supervisor is the most senior and his opinion carried the most weight. 

I have been asked to leave within 2 weeks. I do not know what I have done wrong. I looked through all email correspondences, and the senior associate has never mentioned my inability to take instructions. In fact, his sparse feedback was complimentary. 

I do not wish to leave the firm, as I am just building a reputation for myself. I plan to take up my concerns with senior management. I‚Äôd appreciate any advice on the evidence I should provide, and any arguments I should make."
When HR fails their employees,AskHR,2,diaebl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/diaebl/when_hr_fails_their_employees/,9,1571185957.0,"(AZ) What can be done about an HR department (specifically, the folks empowered to effect change, not recruiters/trainers) that has failed to act in the face of significant breaches of policy?

My company is a mid-sized charitable organization that is affiliated with a large university. There are university employees that work within this organization (and are overseen by university HR) but they are also somewhat bound by our HR as well.

There was an issue a few months back with an entire department (sans its director) meeting with   the VP that oversaw the department. The employees were reporting that director for a laundry list of things, not the least of which was they had told their staff that the VP was their friend and would never believe anything a staff member might say to the VP. Long story short, the VP was shocked by what the department relayed and directed HR to make immediate changes. The director was spoken to and supposedly was ""humbled and shocked"" by what had been said, cried a few crocodile tears and went back to their usual routine. 

Here's the thing: HR changed the org charts and probably said something to university HR, but this director has been promoted, given a raise and has essentially reverted back to their poor behavior. When approached by department staff, HR says there's nothing to be done and just refers them to the VP, who says to speak to HR. Even inquiring if university HR has been apprised of this person's behavior is rebuffed. 

What does one do when an entire HR department basically gives up on enforcing policy?"
Feeling Tension/Pressure to Hire Someone,AskHR,2,di7v5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/di7v5f/feeling_tensionpressure_to_hire_someone/,3,1571174703.0,"Location is US.

Currently in a senior management role and in a situation where I need additional resources to help with tasks I don't have time for.

I initially requested an entry level person I can train quickly to take some tasks off my plate and it was approved by exec team but  the hiring process dragged on so long my candidate (was intern) wound up leaving to do something else.

In the meantime, someone in another department is pushing their own candidate now, for this role, with nearly the same amount of experience I have, and has been derailing my hiring effort by getting into the execs mind that we need to hire someone with this amount of experience.

I feel this would not only be a waste of resources, but would produce tension in my small department as we would have two cooks in the kitchen, instead of me training someone to do a great job.

The other catch is, the person pushing this candidate and the candidate worked together in sales/marketing at another company, which wound up failing financially. This is public knowledge, but the executive team may not be aware of this.

I don't want to sound like I'm being paranoid, but I don't want conflict and I don't want two people in management positions ganging up on me.

I am in sales and I am currently on paid Parental leave for the next 2.5 weeks (as the father). Just as I was about to go on leave, I was interviewing and was offered a new position in a different company. I have accepted the offer, and will be starting the moment I return from my leave.

As I am on parental leave now, I would like to do my 2 week notice courtesy in the next few days as I have had a great relationship with my manager. This should give them a jumpstart in looking for my replacement.

However, I want to make sure that I am still compensated for my work and time off now. My concern is that they will terminate my position the moment I give notice, and if I am not mistaken, will be out of my 2 weeks pay when I do. I would like to ensure that I receive the 2 weeks base, plus clarify any Q3 commission/compensation questions that may arise.

Regarding my compensation, it is a sizable base + commission (commissions are paid out quarterly, hence October 31 is payday).

One thing to note, the company does not function on accrued PTO, as we are working with ""unlimited PTO"". So there are no PTO days to be cashed out once I leave. I am not sure if this would jeopardize my 2-2.5 week base pay once I give my 2 week notice.

Retaliation,AskHR,0,di1rvx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/di1rvx/retaliation/,5,1571137928.0,"So I‚Äôm not sure who this will reach but I have questions. My job is in California, Bay Area to narrow it down. My job wasn‚Äôt the best, I had been working at this company for 3 years and it was sold back in early April. So around the 18th of April the store reopened and it wasn‚Äôt the best time to open, given most of the equipment was broken and we were all told it would be fixed. 

Long story short, I was cornered into taking a manager position with a choice of bringing an assistant manager of my choice after the position was pushed on me. So things were ok, I was getting the hang of being a manger and my assistant manager was a huge help. I was promised a bonus for referring my assistant manager and another bonus because the store was doing well. My assistant manager then referred another employee and was promised a bonus as well. We never saw a dime, every time we brought it up, our bosses said they never received the paperwork, which is a lie, I sent it a total of 5 times throughout the course of being employed there. 

Moving forward, the District Manager and VP of Operations charm started to fade and all employees started too see through the lies. Eventually, 4 employees quit because they found new jobs, another 5 were planning on leaving the following weekend (some for college others because they didn‚Äôt like our bosses). So that put me in a pickle because we would be left with 6 employees including myself. Half of which were college students with 8am classes and others being HS student, here, my problem was not having a fully staffed team and my bosses weren‚Äôt really worried about it. They wanted to convince everyone this job was more important than school. So by the end of the week, everyone had quit and I was expected to run the store with 4 employees. Obviously couldn‚Äôt do that, so I quit as well. 

More problems came to light, my former bosses refused to communicate with me about my final check, 3 days later I finally received it, it was short a lump some. Suddenly, they decided not to pay me the 2 bonuses I earned along with some other money owed and when I asked about it, they changed the terms. Same went for my assistant manager. I have all the text messages of them saying they would pay me, but they never did. 

Eventually after quitting, I called OSHA and they came went into the store, inspected it, gave them a list of things to fix by a certain date and left. 


Fast forward a month later, I get a text from the District Manager asking me to come back and work for the company just to train the new hires, so I said yes. I mainly said yes so I could ask about the money I was owed, but never could catch my bosses at the store. They‚Äôd only come when I wasn‚Äôt there and they would ask the current manager for the schedule so they knew when I was working. The current manager let me know that before bringing me back, the DM and VP told her I tried to ‚Äúbring the company down‚Äù and a bunch of other stuff. 

As of last week, I was taken off the schedule completely and told there wasn‚Äôt enough hours to schedule me, but they have a bunch of 16 year olds working 30+ hrs a week (illegal) and the current manager says she puts me on the schedule but the DM/VP ‚Äúchange what they don‚Äôt like‚Äù. That is a form of retaliation right? How should I go about reporting this? Do I even have enough to go to the Labor Board and file something against this company?"

However, my supervisor and another senior team member (Sarah), whom I work closely with, are not helping me learn any of the technical aspects of my job, despite knowing that I'm new to this business and job. I came to know that Sarah said to my supervisor something to the effect of me not being competent enough, and Sarah even directly said a few things to me that made me feel belittled. Please note that I'm a quick learner in general, but there was no training/knowledge transfer plan, and I have been forced to learn on the go by asking questions. I'm literally feeling bullied here at times, and I'm by nature not a confrontational person. 

Now my plan is to give this another 2-3 months to see how things go. But on the other hand, I'm thinking if it's even worth spending another few months of my life being bullied and belittled. Are people really going to change? 
Complaining about Sarah to HR is likely to be unhelpful, as Sarah is like the backbone of the team and very indispensable. There's nothing anybody can do to her given her very unique and in-demand skillset.

Thanks to everybody for reading this, and your advice very much appreciated.

EDIT: Regardless of my situation above, what are some signs that a new job just isn't for you?"

US - Texas: My assistant manager has been targeting me constantly,AskHR,2,dhlulx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/dhlulx/us_texas_my_assistant_manager_has_been_targeting/,3,1571058063.0,"Hello everyone,

I will try to keep this short. I work in face-to-face retail sales. My assistant manager was hired back in July. She has asked me on several occasions from when she started for me to do shady transactions to which I have addressed with her that I was uncomfortable with following. I spoke directly to the higher up management team about the behavior.

As time went on, she started sabotaging my transactions with my clients. She would jump into my transactions and made my customers uneasy by giving them attitudes and forcing me to jump onto the next customers whenever a waitlist queue was built up. Even, at times when I am finalizing my transactions, she would rush me and threaten me with saying things like, ‚ÄúI told you to do something‚ÄîI‚Äôm not going to tell you again.‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou better get to it or else.‚Äù Mind you, different customers have addressed concerns to me about my assistant manager being incompetent at her job and that she needs training or to find another job. I was also told that they would not come back to shop in my location with my assistant manager there.

My assistant manager has made snarky remarks about how I didn‚Äôt know how to do my job, and she would gossip to other reps about how, ‚Äú...he takes his sweet ass time when he knows there is a wait.‚Äù I found this out from another colleague. Another fact‚ÄîI am a top performer at my position with no disciplinary issues. I am starting to think she has it out for me and would make up lies to try to get me fired when I haven‚Äôt done anything to her personally. She has rolled her eyes at me, demean me and my efforts/accomplishments, and sabotaged my rapport with clientele. She has also called me on my time off from work (contacted me even when I was vacation with my family) and I have told her that I will not answer any work related questions or issues while I am off the clock. She continues to abuse this from time-to-time.

I have brought this up with my general manager and district manager with my general manager defending her. I understand why as she drives a particular metric but she does so unethically. I am not trusting his judgment to handle the situation accordingly and I have told my district manager that I may follow suit to talk to HR as I feel very uncomfortable with working with my assistant manager targeting me.

How can I take a pause from work with with serious mental health issues in a stressful environment?,AskHR,6,dhi0w1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/dhi0w1/how_can_i_take_a_pause_from_work_with_with/,9,1571036753.0,"Hello everyone,

throwaway for privacy

I'm 27 and I feel pretty lost, defeated and trapped and could use some advice. I had a severe panic attack at work 2 months ago and had to be hospitalized.  I qualified for short term disability/FMLA because of my situation and I got paid for a few weeks while I recovered, saw psychologists and psychiatrists and went to therapy and got treated for the serious migraines I also had. I am not sure if others have experienced it, but it felt like severe burnout, hyper paranoia I was going to lose my job (because I was on leave), depression and dissociation from my body and just overall inability to cognitively function like I used to.

This was the first time in my life I actually addressed my mental health issues. I felt pressured to get back to work and came back as soon as the migraines went away and asked to help me find a project to ease me back into work. Now my current project has been 80+ hours of work and incredibly stressful for a myriad of reasons (understaffed, tough client, overworked manager). I didn't tell my team my situation for fear they wouldn't take me on or judge me. However, now I feel trapped and I want to keep pushing, but I just feel so stressed and I had a panic attack last week and feel I can't talk to anyone. I work in consulting so it is hard to leave until the project ends, but I really want to just ask for another role (consulting doesn't seem conducive given my health at this point). I am scared to leave this project because I had to leave my last project when I passed out and I am worried it will negatively impact my career or they will fire me. I am also worried that if I push through and do poorly they will fire me when I ask for time to take care of myself (if I wait until after it's done).

I honestly would love to take an unpaid leave of absence because I have a great job and I want to see if time will help or if I actually just need to leave my job. I really need the healthcare which is also something that scares me from quitting my job to take care of my health. I have worked very hard my whole life so this kills me. I grew up very poor, went to the best schools in the country and got a great job that pays \~200k and I feel awful that I can't shake this off. It's the first time in my life I feel defeated.

I live in the UK and work for a company that carries out d&a tests randomly or post accidents.

Sadly I had a minor RTC today, and this may result in me being drug and alcohol tested tomorrow.

It's a zero tolerance policy, and I will have both THC and benzos (valium) in my system as I've been using lightly for the last couple months. I know I'm an idiot for this and I deserve whatever comes my way, but was wondering what the best call of action is if this is to take place.

If I'm invited to a drugs test, do I;

Quit - tell them I'm leaving and not give notice

Refuse drugs test - this goes down as a positive result and will result in my dismissal.

Carry out drugs test - get dismissed and deal with the embarrassment.

Or I was thinking, would it be possible to just leave work, tell them I'm not refusing the test but am refusing to come in, which would be going AWOL. This would eventually lead to my dismissal, however I would not have a positive d&a result on record. I hope anyway.

I'm skeptical about quitting as should I not be able to secure employment shortly after, I would be refused income allowances (benefit payments) due to the fact that I quit.

To boost my studying, I bought one of the HRPA-provided online study programs, which contains 3 ""practice exams"" (i.e. 1 'diagnostic' exam and 2 'practice exams), which have been helpful so far, but not sure if they are really enough and/or representative of what I should expect on the CKE1 in terms of question style or content. 

Just wondering if anyone has any additional suggestions or insight into the CKE1 exam that they could share? The pass rate posted on HRPA's [website](https://www.hrpa.ca/hrdesignations_/Pages/CKE1-CKE2-Comprehensive-Knowledge-Exam.aspx) is a bit intimidating, so really want to make sure I'm covering all bases. 

My major concern is that I'm not reviewing enough ""nitty gritty"" details, and am focusing on the concepts instead. Since I still have a couple of weeks I can shift my learning if that would be more valuable.

Hi, thanks for your help. I passed the examination process to become a police officer a few years ago. Unfortunately my eligibility expired because of a hiring freeze. It's been a few years and I would like to apply again but I have some concerns regarding the background check. I was in the middle of my background check but did not complete the lie detector and employment verification because of the city's hiring freeze. As a result, my application was put on hold and eventually lost eligibility because the freeze lasted more than 1 year.

I currently work as an independent contractor so I work at multiple locations for short periods of time. My last background investigator told me that I don't have to list every contract I've done because it would be very messy.

Questions:

1. Because I did not get through the lie detector and employment verification, what happens to my old background check? Is it thrown out because it's incomplete?
2. Based on what my last background investigator told me, I'm considering listing myself as an independent contractor on my Resume and referencing only the most important contracts I've worked on. This would be different compared to my last background check because I listed all of my contracts. What do you think about this strategy for my Resume?"

In Canada.

So a quick overview. After being unemployed from my field for over a year, I found a job at a company. It's simply just that, a job, there is no room for growth, and even if there was, I'm not sure it's a place I'd want to be at long term.

Anyhow, in the last two months they hit this financial goal, four times. As a result there is supposed to be some big party which all of the higher ups will fly in for. 

It's at the end of the month, they still haven't given a clear picture of what this party will be like, where it will be, etc. The expectation is business casual, out of twenty something employees I am one of two females.

I don't like work parties and I'm not really comfortable mixing my personal life and work. I've tried to express this discomfort to both managers but they have brushed it off.

I tried to draft an email to the two of them, but everything I typed I could immediately see how they would counter it or argue.

I cannot help but feel the expectation is that everyone is to go. Even though it's a day off, for the party, we are all expected to go. Of course I'm worried if I don't go they will punish me somehow or try to get rid of me. 

I've considered trying to fake illness to get out of it, but at this rate I won't have to as I'll likely be sick with worry. Any suggestions on how to fet away from this would be awesome.

TLDR,
work party, don't want to go, talking to managers will result in lots of aggro. How do I get out of it."

I also moved cities within Alberta, Canada for them for work to try to expand their business. 

Looking at their current financial books it seem like their business is not doing too well at this time but they are actively working on improving their client base. 

This is not performance based, just that economy is not doing good at this time in my current city for them to operate here. Options provided : 

Two week time to decide one of the following two choices, 

a. Either move back to their head quarters office 
     ( cannot move as I got little kids, family, house and lots of ties in my present city of residence )


b. Take lay off. 

( extremely tough to take layoff based on personal financial condition at this time ) 

They have given me 8 week termination period and doing everything according to law other than severance per common law. 

Looking at the clause in employment contract it doesn't say anything about common law, just that they will provide an additional 2 weeks pay only after termination period of 8 weeks is over.

This is quite unheard of and sort of a slap on the face. They had us sign a new employment contract months before this decision and I was stupid enough to sign it not knowing their confusing lawyer language about the severance and a clause. I did this based on trust which I know shouldn't have. I also had a fear in mind that they might let people go if they dont sign it. 

I have great relationships with these guys including their family etc for past 11 years and do not want to loose those relationships and professional references, If I do decide to fight about my severance package after 11 years. 

I have talked to an employment lawyer and they are saying do not take it emotionally and ask for fair severance as per common law which is substantial amount of money for my family to support us in this downturn of economy. 

My question to this community is should I take the law route to fight and gain maximum severance I am entitled to as per common law OR just accept what they are giving me plus a little more based on negotiations to keep them happy as well so I do not loose references especially after 11 years of expeirnce every prospecitve employer would want to in my case. I know from expeirnce they are very cheap and excellent negotiators. 

If I do hire an employment lawyer and let her send letter of demand, I will also loose my relationship with these guys and their families. I guess I am too emotionally attached to the company to harm them in any way and want to part ways on good terms with them. On the other end I feel like I need to think about my family and personal needs first and they are in fact not playing fair with me after 11 years if service and had me sign new employment contract which capped me at 2 week severance only.

I was hired to a full time permanent position with a really descriptive, unambiguous title (something like ‚Äòfirefighter‚Äô where it describes a very specific job). The job description seemed normal, but it‚Äôs got the vague wording that most have now, like the classic ‚Äòother duties as assigned‚Äô. It‚Äôs the first in a series of 3 positions, and in most places that would indicate that the ‚Äòjob title 1‚Äô position is entry level and the 2 and 3 positions are higher experience with more responsibility. 

So I started off at this job, and on the first day I‚Äôm tasked with something completely different from what I thought I‚Äôd be doing (and what was discussed in my interviews). Management mentions that I have to start off doing these tasks, and I‚Äôll get trained to do the job I thought I was going to do when there‚Äôs time. About 6 months in I started hearing that the ‚Äòworking title‚Äô for my position is actually ‚Äòassistant‚Äô (this working title isn‚Äôt mentioned anywhere except internal policy manuals, and was not on any hiring paperwork, or searchable material about the job).  

I‚Äôm a year in now and even though I‚Äôve made a lot of effort to get the training that would help me grow in the job I originally signed on for, I don‚Äôt actually get to do that job. I‚Äôm trying to prove that I can do it (I thought that‚Äôs what the vetting/hiring process was for) but my coworkers and management seem to think there‚Äôs nothing weird about telling someone they‚Äôre getting one job, and having them do the duties for another. 

Sorry for the rant-style wall of text, but I don‚Äôt even know if this is an issue HR can help with. I‚Äôm in such a small department that it‚Äôs be super obvious if I made an anonymous complaint. Recently I asked to get business cards ordered, just to have the same supplies my coworkers have, and what I received were generic business cards with the assistant title on them, without my name. I asked our head admin for new cards with my name on them, but he thought there wasn‚Äôt anything wrong, and people in my position shouldn‚Äôt have personalized cards (even though i deal with the public and other business regularly). It‚Äôs ridiculous, and it makes me feel like I could be a cardboard cutout employee for all they care. I really wanted to do this job, but I feel sick when I think about my situation now. (And then I feel bad about feeling so touchy about it, since it still pays the bills)

Any advice would be appreciated."

After a case of harassment was basically dismissed and the person was just transferred out, I was fed up. I decided to go for a job that is my passion. I put in a notice that was three weeks, to cover a vacation of my store leader out of kindness. While manager gone, we will call it ""assistant"" manager was placed in charged. A major lack communication and direction one day, while I was actually sick but came in to work anyways, led to the ""assistant"" manager approaching me while obviously stressed out. Store manager did not inform me of the extra projects that assistant was supposed to do today, and how I was to run the usual daily functions. This led to ""assistant"" having a melt down, when I had no clue they didn't even mention it when we started work. We compromised and worked together to get the job done on time. I continued my duties but the comments said earlier by them I wanted to address later. The conversation was extremely dull, no sense of care for my concerns, couldn't take my feedback. Retaliated against me and tried to assert I was in the wrong for something completely not related. I decided to walk out of the sitatution because they were obviously hostile. I went home. I did comment on my way out to a fellow employee that I never want to come back. I still had 4 days left of my 20 day notice. **The Director of Operations got involved, they are a person high on the corporate ladder. She did call me, I explained the toxic circumstances, she then said they took my walking out as quitting and I am no longer employed with them. They agreed to pay me out the rest of my notice, so I just decided to remain calm and just accept it, though I did say I was intending to complete my notice, but the stress of assistant manager was overwhelming and I was literally sick with a cold. The phone call ended and then my phone rang a couple seconds later. I answered with a hello, it was the director again, mocking what I just said and our conversation, and didn't realize she called me instead of the intended person and was rambling about our conversation in a condescending way. She totally was oblivious for at least 1 min that she called me instead of whoever she was trying to.

Compensation changes,AskHR,2,dgtedo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/dgtedo/compensation_changes/,6,1570904881.0,"Hi I'm in Nashville TN.  I work as a remote technical support agent. 

I have been hourly since I was hired. The company is pushing the tech agent's into a pay per session model.

This is the pay breakdown 
Low survey scores $2 a session 
Medium survey scores $2.50 a session 
High survey scores $2.75

Now customers pretty much dictate your compensation. You can be a great agent and not be able to solve someone's issues, and they low score you. 

So at a low score you have to complete close to 400 sessions a week to break even.  Between long sessions,  technical difficulties and other nonsense no one is getting close to that.

My real question is this: when I questioned my supervisor about changing departments, he stated that he would not sign off on any transfers...that if people do not like it, they can quit. 

I feel that was a disrespectful response and it also feels like a veiled threat, that he would torpedo any internal transfer.  Which there are 5 different hourly positions that I can go to.

His supervisor stated the same thing to another coworker. 

So who do I go to? Can't go to my supervisor,  his supervisor either. I want to go to HR but dont want to get crap for jumping the chain of command.

Background: a few months ago, during a half-day training, I stepped out of the training to get a cup of coffee. Not like ""buying coffee at a coffeeshop"" but just walking to the breakroom, pouring coffee in my mug, and coming back. I was gone 2-3 minutes, tops. Two other coworkers left at roughly the same time (one to get coffee as well and the other to go to another meeting). The person leading the meeting thought this was some sort of show of force against her (?) and made a scene about it after the training.

Fast forward about a month and I'm being called into an attorney's office. The attorney says she's been hired by the company to investigate the incident. What proceeded  was an hour and a half of what felt like interrogation. She asked me why I left the training. How long was I gone? Did I think it was appropriate to step out for coffee? Were there breaks?  .... and the kicker ... Did you organize a protest against <person leading training>? Did I plan to walk out with my coworkers? Did someone else coerce me to walk out with them? And so on.

My first thought was - this is ridiculous. No one organized anything, to my knowledge. And if they did, I wasn't included. But the more I think about all this, the more worried I am about my job security (and the apparent toxicity here as well).

Should I be concerned about this? Does this seem odd to anyone else? Location: United States. Don't want to say what state but I will say that we are an at-will employment state. Not unionized."

First of all when you turn 21 are you still entitled to the payrise for that age group if you are over that wage already?

Secondly My manager changes peoples shift times without notifying employee's I witnessed him changing peoples start times today to match the rota that he changed on the day and didn't tell anybody. I've also been over paid before because they have tried to save labor by paying me on a previous or later week to make the numbers look better and they took the money back from me and I had to live on ¬£360 in a whole month,

Another thing are managers allowed to force you to take a break I was on a 7pm-11pm shift today but he changed my start time to 7:30pm when i got there. after working for a while I went for a ciggerate, we normally go smoke while being paid anyway but I was smoking earlier and he made me go on a half an hour break and I tried to refuse but he made me go.

I'm part of a little tiny startup whose HR is run by Justworks. Last pay period, my approver didn't realize hours needed to be approved, because the alert was bundled into another oft-ignored alerts email. This period, something even more absurd happened - today I was complained-to that because I didn't submit my hours ""in time"", I missed this pay period deadline.

The period of my time card ends on 10/12 - which is tomorrow (well, today). How the hell could I be late, if the card hasn't even lapsed yet?

It seems blatantly fraudulent to write-in hours that hadn't actually occurred. Hell, is that not the very definition of fraud? It's a place to write hours worked, not hours you think you might work. And nothing about the system said I should ""predict"" anything.

My question isn't really ""is this normal"", but rather, ""what set of conditions or inherited operational practices led to this ever being considered acceptable, and why is it still a thing today?""."

From the outset, I made it clear to my employers that I planned to start a postgraduate degree, and could only stay for 18 months. This is very common in my profession. 

I was initially hired for the specific purpose of helping my boss (‚ÄòBob‚Äô). Initially, I thought that Bob was agreeable but slightly odd. He had poor social skills and struggled to explain himself clearly. He was always polite, but his niceness was clearly artificial. 

I struggled to work with him and had to ask a lot of follow-up questions. But ultimately, my work was technically good and he never made complaints. 

Further, I had the opportunity to work for other people and they had no issues with my work. I know this because they repeatedly delegated complex tasks to me. 

Last week, I was finalising my application for a post-graduate scholarship. I asked Bob to provide a reference. He agreed (rather enthusiastically). 

Today, HR called me to a meeting and indicated that Bob wanted to terminate my position because I ‚Äòstruggled to take instructions‚Äô. 

I was confused: he had never previously said this. Plus, why did he agree to provide a reference for someone he wanted to dismiss? 

I told HR this, and they agreed to ‚Äòinvestigate‚Äô the situation. I asked them to talk to the other people I had worked for. They agreed and said it may be possible to transfer me to a different department. 

I spoke to a few trusted colleagues, and they were also confused. They said that Bob was an ‚Äòoddball‚Äô, and that the only plausible reason was that Bob did not like me on a personal level. They said that I am unusually direct and ‚Äòfearless‚Äô for a young woman, and Bob may be uncomfortable with this. This is true- but I don‚Äôt see this as a good reason to terminate my employment!

I'm going to a different firm, not a direct competitor, actually a client of ours.  My last day is next week.

My boss is refusing to approve my last expense claim.  I have provided all receipts and requests for those costs, all of which are completely within policy and verifiable.  It's only ~$750 so not a ton, but it's really unprofessional and adds to the reasons I'm leaving (which is basically her inability to communicate and lead the team).  I plan to bring everything up in detail at my exit interview.

Her basis for not confirming my expenses are that some are over 90 days.  This is a policy, but not one adhered to.  There are plenty of other people that submit and are paid for expenses incurred well over 90 days ago, which I can prove.  She is very disappointed I am leaving because another team member left in July and another (unexpectedly) last week.  We are understaffed and she has hired two awful people (despite my opinion after interviewing them myself) that were fired.

Basically, if she doesn't pay out my expense claim, what do I do?  I'm tempted to just say 'then this is my last day' or allude to the fact that I'm not going to work the full notice if she won't approve the claim - because at this point IDGAF.  What would happen?  Is this doing too much?  What do I do if it isn't paid out?  I have all corresponding documents/receipts that verify the charges.

Resumes and Employment Verifications,AskHR,2,dgkfyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/dgkfyl/resumes_and_employment_verifications/,2,1570852898.0,"Location: Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA

Hello everyone! I have a question but don't really know who to direct it to.

From my understanding, when applying for a position, you adjust your resume according to that position. Say, if you are applying for a position as a Customer Service Representative, you're going to make it so that your resume lists your experience that shows customer service. This may include removing positions that don't really relate to it (say, working as a production assistant at a manufacturing facility or working as a file clerk at a small company with only a few months experience). 

So here are my questions:
- Is it okay to leave out jobs that don't relate to the position you are applying for?
- If you left out jobs in your resume but you are required to do employment verification, do you have to put ALL the jobs that you've had, including production assistant and file clerk or can you leave those out since they weren't in your resume?
- Is it better to put ALL your jobs on your resume, regardless of whether or not they relate to the position?

If anyone can give me an insight regarding this, that would be great!"

The position is a great match for me and my resume and I felt the interview went well last week. The HR manager asked me about my hometown and stated the department would be reaching out by October 11 and the next step would be a low key meeting, not an interview.

Because of this voluntary info and the interview going well I thought I would get the job. Sure enough a received I voicemail from the hiring manager for the dept. and asked I call or respond to her email back about meeting with the department head for a 30 minute ""informational session"" and wanted to know ""anytime I can meet with the dept head next week"".

Because I sometimes get anxious over the phone, I responded back via email, ""Thanks so much, thats wonderful. I can make myself available anytime Tuesday through Friday at whatever time for 30 minutes"".

She immediately emailed back. ""Can you meet Monday at 1000am?""

Two quick questions, please guys:

1. Do you think I already have the job and this is just making sure I'm a good fit, meeting team members and such? Or should I very much approach this as another interview?

and 2. Should I email her back to confirm at 1000am Monday, despite SPECIFICALLY saying I'm not available until Tuesday?

So I recently started a new job. 1 month ago. Let's say I'm still in the training phase. Not really a concrete contract set out for me yet in terms of benefits / paid time off. However in my initial exchange with the owner of the company, I had asked would I get public holidays and paid time off. Which I have in writing the answer being yes. Now this Monday a.k.a Columbus day is the first public holiday, And it has come to my attention that the rest of the office staff don't seem to be off for it. There are 4 office staff including myself. So I find myself in a dilemma. I have a work related meeting with the owner today & I want to clarify the subject, I fear if I let this first holiday go I will be at the mercy of what holiday suits them for me to take off and this is not what I had agreed. I took it as all official public holidays I was off. 

Any suggestions on how to go about this ?"

I was told no one wanted to report his behavior for a few reasons. He's the uncle of the owner/CEO, he is 69 and many presuming he will be leaving the company soon, and people not wanting to ""rock the boat"" as it were.

Perhaps I was out of line because I had no first hand knowledge of sexual harassment myself but I reported on the tip line that Creepy Uncle VP had liked to discuss inappropriate sexual topics when alone with female subordinates as well as asking for hugs and a lot of women in the office knew it to the point where they tried avoiding being alone with him.

I am being underpaid on a new title that I have been developing on my company for 1 year as It Specialist with tasks also as a System administrator (Sole IT person on a business that works exclusively on postproduction computers with more than 100 workers and daily issues, tickets, support to workers, managers, administration stuff...).  


Now that I showed that I am more than good doing my job, I want to ask for a proper raise according to what is the standard salary in my province (Quebec). The manager's team told me that I am one of the hardest workers and efficient workers in the company.

I want to ask you what would be the most accurate and professional information to present in the meeting?

The three sources of information that I am using now are payscale, glassdoor and nuevoo.  


My salary started at 3800 CD with year increases of 2.500. I want to propose to have a new contract that is close to 50k based on the information I am managing.  


I have University Studies (masters included) in another field outside of IT-Computer Since. Since I got this job, I am studying and getting certifications to be more efficient.  


What are your suggestions?

Let me apologize if I'm not following the rules, first and foremost.  I did a preliminary rule read-through, but it wasn't super thorough.

Here's the deal: I work at a mental health counseling center.  A lot of our clients, for various reasons, have a preference for male/female/trans\* counselors, and that is something that we honor because we're working on healing and coping, etc.

The issue has become that we have a TON of female counselors, and the male counselors that we do have are full or don't see children.

In order to meet the needs of our clients, we are trying to hire male counselors who specialize in working with children and adolescence.  I can't remember where, but I thought I read something saying that it was okay to specify gender in a job description if it was related to a client need.  (I recognize that this may be bunk.)  My thought is that, because it's based on client need, it's okay to say, ""We are looking for a male counselor to serve our minor clients.""  My boss steadfastly refuses.

I understand that we can't discriminate based on gender; simultaneously, as mental healthcare providers, how can we best meet the needs of clients who want male/masculine counselors?"

I was not sure where to post this, but seeing as my HR might be getting involved I figured I‚Äôd try to get some insight first. 

In short, promotions were announced this week at my multi-site company and it has destroyed morale and productivity. 

There were five promotions in total: two people in Location A and three people in Location B. They were all promoted to the same position. Think of the role being a promotion from a entry level position to a ‚Äúspecialist‚Äù position. 

Below are the details:

1. Site A and B are recognized as one team and they work towards the same common goal. All large projects and job roles are talked about openly with others.  

2. Those who were passed over in Site A have pages of accomplishments and successful projects, are recognized as leaders on the team, and have been actively working towards the job title. These people have *trained* those who were promoted in Site B. 

3. These qualified employees at Site A have concrete proof that shows they already fit the senior job description. 

4. **They are expected to continue working their advanced roles without the title. Those who were promoted in Site B will not be taking on additional responsibilities since Site A does them.**

When discussing with Site A management, the leaders stated there is no solid promotion policy and talked in loops when asked ‚Äúwhat additional skills and accomplishments do you look for me to have before promoting me?‚Äù 

Productivity has dropped and the affected employees are beginning looking for new jobs. Do you have any advice for Site A? How can employees of Site A position their concerns to HR in order to be heard?"

Why should I have to lose out on pay because of circumstances that are out of my control, circumstances dictated by my line of work/employer.
My coworkers including me have opted out of the 14hour working day limitation and night worker rules do not apply either as our industry required 24hr staffing and is often busy and emergency/priority work oriented.

Just for some context, I have dyspraxia, a disability that affects my hand-eye co-ordination and generally makes me more clumsy than the average person. I still work very hard despite my disability and try my best to be as fast as I can without making any mistakes. I also have anxiety and have a history of panic attacks, especially in stressful situations. I was asked to fill out some paperwork when I started, and this information is on there.

A few days ago, my manager pulled me into one of the booths halfway through my shift (so yes, while the customers were still there), told me that I'm being given another training shift because she thinks I'm working too slow and started yelling at me over it. Just fyi, I started working there just before the previous manager and a lot of staff members were about to quit, and it was so chaotic that I didn't really get any proper training and it was more of a ""learn on the job"" situation. Also, I had no idea that she thought I was working too slow until she started yelling at me over this. She never came up to me and asked me to speed up my work in the weeks leading up to this and I also haven't received any comments like that from other members of staff, so this came completely out of nowhere.

I was so shaken up by the way she just started yelling at me that I was finding it hard to work properly during the second half of my shift. She had made me so anxious that I started crying and was obviously not in a good state of mind when talking to customers or preparing orders. She had also put me on a new section that day and was getting angry at me because I didn't know exactly what to do, despite the fact that it was my first time working on that section. Ever. She was also belittling the fact that I'm good at working at the till, and said something along the lines of ""so what, anyone can work at the till"".

I spoke to her at the end of my shift about my disability and how she had upset me by yelling at me. She dragged me into a booth again (which had a whole table of customers behind it) and started arguing with me when I brought up my disability, basically tried to say that she knew my disability better than I do (which is complete bs obviously) and responded to my comment about me being upset by saying ""I'm being nice to you by paying you"". I only get paid minimum wage, and she's also not even the one paying me, the store owner pays me. And if she wasn't paying me that would be illegal. This behaviour triggered a panic attack and I told her I was thinking of quitting (which she also reacted very aggressively to).

Also, just to add more salt to the wound, this all happened the day before my birthday.

I've reported her to the assistant manager and the store owner, but nothing has been done. She hasn't apologised to me, and nobody has apologised to me on her behalf.

I'm going to hand in my notice soon - I wanted to hand in my notice on the spot, but I'm moving to London soon and I need the money. This has also been creating arguments between me and my dad because he wants me to get as much money as I can out of them before I quit (despite the fact that I now feel incredibly anxious and miserable in this job, especially when I'm forced to work with the manager). Does anyone have any advice on this situation? Should I keep trying to report her or should I just stop trying?

TL;DR - My manager has been arguing with me over my disability and started yelling at me in front of customers over it.

Update: Just got my rota for next week and I've only been given two shifts...

Update 2: The assistant manager and one of the supervisors spoke to me about this yesterday. Apparently I'm not in trouble for reporting her and she's been given a disciplinary hearing from the store owner and the assistant manager because of her behaviour. The assistant manager told me that I'm being given extra training because I didn't really get it when I started working there, which is not what she told me at all. This kind of confirms my theory that she just wanted an excuse to yell at me and was stretching the truth to make it look like I was in trouble. I'm also pretty sure that she only gave me two shifts next week out of spite because I reported her."

I mentioned this to no one, but another woman who filed a formal discrimination complaint for similar issues reported what she saw happen to me to HR.

The original woman who complained was given a large severance to leave amicably. 

I later had an illness that was covered by FMLA, and the co-founder of the company threatened my job security due to my inability to meet a project deadline. HR intervened at my request, and I again received an apology.  I‚Äôm no longer covered under FMLA.

I was never given a process ‚Äúplan‚Äù or anything along those lines. I asked to sit down with her for her to show me, she did for 20 minutes the following day. Of course this was on the file closing that was addressed before - they both did it completely differently which I told her and her response to me was ‚ÄúI trained Megan‚Äù. 

Last week, she decided to call one of her random meetings and goes on to tell me I need to improve and she thinks I‚Äôm ‚Äúway too confident in myself‚Äù. 

Last Friday, I also told her that I‚Äôm dealing with some health issues - I‚Äôm in the process of being diagnosed with celiac disease. I‚Äôm on a high dose of steroids and they‚Äôre going to need to bare with me for a couple days. She explained how she understood and how helpful that is to know. Monday, I had to leave work early for breaking out into rashes due to the gluten. I obviously had to leave immediately (per my doctor) to be seen. She saw the rashes for herself and didn‚Äôt fight me or oppose me leaving and gave me a bullshit ‚Äúgood luck‚Äù as I was leaving. I was given a doctors note to stay home on Tuesday but, I chose to go to work instead. Side note: my condition qualifies me for FMLA. My doctor said he would definitely sign off on it, however I don‚Äôt qualify for it.  

I sent an email to HR yesterday stating the position I‚Äôm in about my health and was asking if I was able to keep anything on file with them or what I can do during my probation period - no answer. 

Today, at 3:30 she decided she was going to have another random meeting. She came by my desk and said, can you chat for a second? I said sure thinking nothing of it, I go into the room and her and my supervisor directly below her were there. She goes ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to start this convo but you have two options, either I fire you and you are blacklisted from ever working here again or you sign this resignation. 

I asked if I had a chance to think about this or to someone. She said no, either you sign this or I fire you. She handed me a piece of paper, undated with one sentence saying ‚ÄúI resign my position with the county of ____ effective immediately‚Äù. I signed the stupid paper to just save my own ass in the future when it comes to jobs. There was no HR person present during this - nor have I ever spoken to a person in HR during my employment. 

I grabbed my stuff, walked out and she goes ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt anything personal‚Äù. The amount of effort it took me from not turning around with a ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù is out of this world. 

I‚Äôm a little upset about all of this because you know, who wants to be ‚Äúterminated‚Äù but also I don‚Äôt even give a shit. Her and I were never going to get along and it was going to probably be now or later. Also going to look at the employee handbook and speak with HR probably on Friday, none of this seems too procedural to me.

To make it clear I do NOT want my job back within that department or in any department in which she has her hands in. 

1. I just would like to express how screwed up this thing is. 
2. I would like to give HR a heads up if this was NOT procedural."
Pay Discrepancy,AskHR,2,dfouyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/dfouyd/pay_discrepancy/,7,1570690198.0,"I'm in California.

In late August, my boss verbally told me that I would be getting a 54 cent raise (I could have sworn he said 56 cents but that's neither here nor there). I have been here for a little more than a year. When I got my next two paychecks after my raise, they showed $1.18 more and put me at par with what everyone else in our small group is making. When I got my next few paychecks, I saw that I was only making 54 cents more.

We get automatic deposits and our pay stubs are available online, so I really have no excuse for not checking every week. 

Anyway, my manager resigned and moved away and last week they hired someone externally to replace my old boss. New boss is still learning the ropes. I emailed him to ask what my pay rate is but I'm not expecting a response before the next paycheck. 

If I'm indeed making 54 cents more, will I have to pay back the difference from when they paid me $1.18 more? I'm pretty upset."

How should I deal with a boss that nitpicks everything I do?,AskHR,2,dfnc3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/dfnc3i/how_should_i_deal_with_a_boss_that_nitpicks/,1,1570683661.0,"I started a job that I generally like, I get along well with my colleagues ,except for my boss. She seems to have decided that she doesn‚Äôt like me, and nitpicks the hell out of everything I do.

 For example, I communicate with dozens of factories, keeping track of hundreds of items, reports, and emails each day. Every once in a while, I would miss a piece of information in an email, which is never a big deal because I could simply ask again or clarify misunderstandings. She, however, would make a big deal out of it and chastise me for my bad memory and carelessness.
There are even several times where I was wrongfully yelled at, only to find out in the end that she was the one that got it all wrong. 

What pisses me off is that I‚Äôm not the only one that misses information in emails, everybody does, and she does too(possibly even more often than I do)
But of course, she gets away with it because she‚Äôs the manager.

Is there room for improvement? Yes

Is it my responsibility to minimize my errors and be on top of my job so that my boss can trust what I do? Absolutely

But we‚Äôre humans, not machines, and things like these are gonna happen. 
I have yet to make a mistake big enough to cause monetary loss to our company. 
While it‚Äôs sometimes necessary for mistakes to be pointed out, I certainly don‚Äôt deserve this type of bullshit.

In addition to being extremely critical, she hardly ever provides constructive feedback and gets angry whenever I ask for her input on a given task, giving remarks like ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have to ask me this, go figure it out yourself‚Äù 

I think her constant nitpicking is preventing me from doing my best work because I refrain from taking the initiative to do things due to the fear of making mistakes. And that anxiety, ironically, causes even more mistakes. 
I know this because I‚Äôm wayyyy more productive and less error-prone when she‚Äôs away. 

This situation is making me look bad, and I am worried about my job security.

Any info on First Advantage background checks (standard vs finger print),AskHR,2,dfmzqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/dfmzqy/any_info_on_first_advantage_background_checks/,4,1570682219.0,"Location: Missouri 

So I accepted a job offer. It‚Äôs a big deal, more than double the pay of any job I‚Äôve had before. 

I was on probation for a felony SIS from 10+ years ago. The probation was completed, records expunged, etc. This incident (the arrest record) only exists in the FBI database. Everywhere else, it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs never happened. 

I have done countless background checks with zero red flags. I pass NICS background when I buy guns even. The one big exception is when I worked at a bank, and had to be fingerprinted for the background check, which was sent to the FBI. 

The company that conducted the check was First Advantage. Their fingerprint check was the only one that has ever found this record. 

Turns out, this new job uses First Advantage for their background checks as well. But this is insurance, not a bank. It‚Äôs not as thorough... no fingerprints or anything like that. 

It seems to be just a standard background check that I‚Äôve passed a dozen times. 

But I‚Äôm concerned about them using the old fingerprint background check from the bank, like maybe they still have that info on file in their records and will use it. 

Does anyone know anything about First Advantage? Can a background check company use info from a totally different background check from a totally different client?

Normally I‚Äôd be 100% confident that there‚Äôs no issue. I‚Äôm just concerned that it‚Äôs the same company. Even though it‚Äôs a different type of background check with no fingerprints. 

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

From Philly. I recently got hired as an HR Admin for a company. For now, it's only me and my HR Manager in the company. On the outside, they looked pretty neat- employees could watch and play games, everyone gets issued laptops, you can sit anywhere you like (sofas, bean bags etc.). We also have free lunch. These benefits are great, but the salary is a little low. As in the workload i think is not commensurate to the salary. In my country, the salary is not enough to feed a family for a month. The perks and environment is great and all, but in my first month I've also observed that there was a high attrition rate in the company. In 2019 alone they had more than 10 people leave. When I asked a resigning employee why he was resigning, he said he was overloaded by management, even working for multiple superiors at once. The environment, although less strict than most companies, is also a little too open, i think. I have recently found out that the bosses here curse and insult people a lot. While it is okay to vent out frustration, I feel that it is degrading to be cursed at by your boss. I understand not everything has to be peachy all the time but it feels demotivating to be called ""fucking people"" when you're trying your hardest. I would like to do something about this as the environment is generally okay but the cursing boss in question is the CEO/Owner. What can I do about this situation? I know that as HR people we're supposed to take care of our human capital as they are the most vital instruments in an organization. This cursing is anxiety-inducing at worst. I just got a taste of it recently myself. It felt like a hundred bricks being thrown at me. 

My question is- is there anything I can do as HR to take care of this situation? Also, are there any labor laws in place about healthy working environments or anti-verbal abuse in the office? What if the offending party is the CEO?"

I work in an education sector job. As full time I worked 220 days a year and earned $88k per year with about 20 vacation days.

They want to make me part time at 215 days a year and pay me $93k (so $5k more per year). I will earn no vacation time, but will work 5 fewer days in a year than I did if I took all my vacation time. 

Retirement contributions and medical stay the same. 

It seems to me that those vacation days were benefits worth about $17k. They are taking those away and are giving me only $5k for them. Overall, the agency is about $12k better off than before.

I have received an email that states "" Hours for part time staff have been calculated taking into account the bank holiday/workplace closure days entitlements."".

For a bit of extra info, i get 13 extra holidays total per year, 8 bank holidays, and an additional 5 workplace closure days. also if it helps, 7 of the 13 holidays fall on my part time days.

So I have a two part question. One: Which state laws apply to me in general? TX because that is where my primary employer is located? VA because they are the ones I know and work with every day? DC because that's where the office is? VA because that's where the business is that owns the DC office?? 

But the main part of my question is that I asked for a written copy of the TX employer's PTO policy, and they have been really cagey and basically dodging my questions and not giving me any information beyond the rate at which I accrue PTO.

Anything shady here?,AskHR,57,df3lib,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/df3lib/anything_shady_here/,30,1570586138.0,"I‚Äôm posting from a throwaway as I have (former) colleagues on reddit. This is in Indiana, involves a large, Fortune 100 insurance company.

I had the same manager - we‚Äôll call her K - for about 1.5 years. The entire time I have felt like she had it out for me. I do NOT believe this to be any discrimination based on me being in a protected class, I think for some reason she just doesn‚Äôt get me and flat out just doesn‚Äôt like me.

For one example, I did a 6 week mentorship for a position that would have been a promotion. My mentor strongly encouraged me to apply when a position opened up. [Side note that will be relevant momentarily - at approximately the same time as I completed the mentorship, my manager‚Äôs peer, J, was promoted to oversee the whole department, replacing the former unit manager, P, and becoming J‚Äôs direct report]. So a position is opening up and J comes to let me know this and asks me to apply, which I did. J would have been making the ultimate hiring decision. K tells me bluntly that she does not support this. Nonetheless, I get a call from HR and they schedule an interview a few days later. When I show up that morning (all dressed up in a day I normally worked from home) I find that P emailed my work email at 10 the night before saying that based on a conversation he had with K, he‚Äôs having my interview canceled. Humiliating.

That was a big one. But she routinely spends huge chunks of her day scrutinizing my work to an insane degree (like listening to all my voicemails and then looking into the file to see if it had been documented as having been returned, etc.), consistently belittles me and makes me feel like trash. It‚Äôs been completely demoralizing. I‚Äôve kept detailed records of this pattern, have copies of every email, IM conversation, etc. on my personal laptop. I always save the receipts!

She then issues me a written warning and puts me on probation for performance, though the requirements were not measurable, nor were they based on my actual metrics.

Yesterday I met with K‚Äôs boss J and expressed my concerns in great detail. J said that she would be dealing with this, but couldn‚Äôt until she returned to the office (she left midday yesterday), but recommended I file a complaint with HR. She also said that the case manager handling my probation had unexpectedly gone on leave so nothing would be happening immediately regardless. At the end of the workday I submitted an HR complaint.

I came in this morning and she pulled me into a meeting right away. Another manager, R, who is the same level as K, was in the room. K told me, ‚ÄúI know you would probably have expected J to be here but it‚Äôs fine for R to be here instead‚Äù, which sort of made me feel like it wasn‚Äôt fine. She fired me for not sufficiently improving my performance.

So my question for you HR professionals is will there (or could there) be any fallout for her terminating me the following morning after I filed an HR complaint? I understand my job is gone, I would just like some insight on how this type of situation may play out on K‚Äôs end."

My parents are telling me that if I take FMLA and possibly LWOP (leave without pay) that my job can choose to deny my FMLA, not consider me for the promotion and let me go for any reason.

Is there any concrete proof that they can do that? I don't see it in any forms they've asked me to sign. TIA!

Co-worker Travel Help gone TOTALLY wrong,AskHR,5,df9gfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/df9gfj/coworker_travel_help_gone_totally_wrong/,4,1570611115.0,"Hello, 

I‚Äôm in WA State USA and have a close relationship with a 60 yr old co-worker who asked me to assist him with booking a plane ticket & filling out an entry form. He‚Äôs visiting an international destination and told me he didn‚Äôt feel comfortable doing either on his own so I gladly agreed to help.

Together we sat at the computer meticulously verifying every detail of his ticket and his entry form for the country. I made sure to ask him multiple times if everything was correct before booking/ submitting either. I thought this was the end of the story and felt great when I went home. And then . . .  

He started asking about buying travelers insurance, if I can help him exchange money, if he has to pay for baggage, extending his departure date -he wants to know how he will get to and from the airport, help booking a hotel, renting a car and more.  

I feel like my act of helping out a co-worker with two simple tasks has turned me into a travel agent (which I am not (and am hopelessly unqualified to be)) this has created a really awkward work environment.  

I have set boundaries and told him that he should discuss travelers insurance with his insurance agent. Have told him I don‚Äôt feel comfortable handling his money in an exchange process and to contact his bank. I have told him that he will need to arrange for transport, leisure activities and accommodation on his own or with a travel agent because I have never been to that country. I have reminded him that I only agreed to help him book a ticket and fill out the entry form.

No matter what I say or how I say it I get the sense every day that he is holding me fully accountable for all aspects of his trip and the quality of it. He is frustrated because I will not take on the extra responsibility for his vacation. I‚Äôve always considered him to be a highly competent and capable individual, but in this case he seems to be completely lost confused and in need of extra help.  

I have no idea what to do. As I see it I agreed to help my co-worker book a ticket and fill out an entry form at his bequest and nothing else. I have directed him to the proper resources for further travel plans and told him that I am not comfortable assisting in other ways because I am not qualified to do so. Is there anything else I can do here or just wait it out until his trip comes and goes?

Questions on criticising manager in exit interview (I am in UK),AskHR,5,df3lf7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/df3lf7/questions_on_criticising_manager_in_exit/,1,1570586126.0,"Everything I read suggests this is a bad idea.  Yet in every discussion on LinkedIn people are very open about company culture, mental health and employees leaving managers not companies.

As HR, is this something that you want to know about during an exit interview?  What sort of followup would happen on it in practice?  What would change if it wasn't an isolated case but a trend from one manager's reports?  In these days of bland risk-averse references (at least from larger companies) does the risk still exist?  Given that if someone didn't like their manager the chances are it went both ways anyway, what extra is there for the departing employee to risk?  Do you have any anecdotes?"
How do I prove this is happening?,AskHR,12,dezn4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/dezn4c/how_do_i_prove_this_is_happening/,12,1570568543.0,"I'm working at a financial institution. Unwritten company rules require all ""lower level"" employees to be monitored at their cubicle via ""secret"" cameras and their headsets are always being listened to by the ""higher levels"" even when not interacting with customers.

Lower level employees are not told anything about this monitoring.

I'm one of the lower level employees. I often hear the higher level employees making harsh comments, some of which are racial, about me. Everytime they see me yawn on cam, everytime I burp silently (because there's a headset), everytime I scratch my head or face... always some kind of comment (well not always, but ok)

Things to the effect of:  
""NO! PLEASE DON'T SCRATCH YOUR \*\*\*\*""

""I BET HE'S GOING TO SH\*\* THROUGH HIS MOUTH""

""I BET YOUR A\*\* IS SO SWEATY""

""HE KEEPS SCRATCHING HIS EYES! HAHA!""

I understand that having to watch someone and listen to their every breath can be annoying because how can you do that without making a comment?

At one point, during the earlier months, my supervisor shouted, ""HEY LEAVE HIM ALONE GUYS"" But when I asked him who he was referring to, he said he ""didn't remember.""

I'm seriously thinking of quitting. I'm not trying to start any kind of fight with anyone. I just wanted to work in peace, and make money that I need to not be evicted. That's the only reason why I'm still on the job. Also, it doesn't look good on my resume if I quite abruptly.

It's just that none of these comments are said to me directly, and so... I don't want to bring it up with HR or with my supervisor if they're just misheard.

I was trying to rehearse one of our required disclosures so I could memorize it, and one of my higher ups who's always listening into my headset muttered: ""you sound like sh\*t""

I just... it's very cosmic, because this 24/7 monitoring is going on in my personal life as well, and it seems to be a theme of this current arc of my life. I'm really unsure what to do.

Edit: location is England 

I was off sick last year for around 4 months due to a condition called giant cell tumour and a pathological femur fracture. 

My company has always said they work on a 12 month sickness policy and we get up to 3 months full pay for sickness. 

I am now due to have surgery as my first operation didn‚Äôt solve the issue and I have been working for the past 10 months with a fractured femur still. I will need around 6 weeks off this time but my company has told me that since I had over 8 weeks off sick last year I am not entitled to anything from them. 

This could be company specific so I am seeking advice. I suppose it‚Äôs difficult to swallow because I‚Äôve been in constant pain which they‚Äôve known about but this year I haven‚Äôt had a single day off sick I‚Äôve just tried really hard to be present because I felt so guilty for being off so long last year. 

I am due to meet with HR this Thursday where I plan to tell them that I need this operation which will take place in November this year. 

Any help or advice would be hugely appreciated.

He called to let me know the basics of the offer and then sent over the letter.

I was very happy and asked if he could also send over the benefits package so I could review prior to signing. He was more than happy to and sent a lot of information.

I responded the next day, Friday, with 2 counters to the offer. From a lot of research I was told to always counter even with something small to get a feel on how the company reacts. For example if they rescind immediately I most likely did not want to work there anyway.

The 1st was 2 additional PTO days to match what I currently have. (Offered 18, I have 20)

2nd was letting them know I am less than 3 months away from a large yearly bonus. This was my wording, as close as I remember (sorry on mobile)
 - ""I am currently less than 3 months away from recieving my yearly bonus, prorated to 9 months it is ~$13.5K. I am not asking or expect for this to be matched, however is there any wiggle room in the base, or potentially a small signing bonus to help offset this loss?""

I heard back on Friday ""Sounds good. I will see what I can do on my end""

Was curious if this is a big ask on their part from me and how long it usually takes for them to get back.

I am in the US and this is a very large international company for reference.

My husband works nights for a unionized company.  On Tuesday October 1st the graveyard shift was notified that schedules were going to be permanently changing going forward (switching from 12hrs to 8hrs including, shifting some of the crew around). Management stated they would let folks know by this weekend and gave the crew time off from October 2 - 6. 

My husband didn't hear anything from management as stated. So, today, Monday October 7th my husband decided to text the plant manager who, at 3:45am, finally shared his new schedule (to start today October 7th at 9:00pm). Aside from the obvious (and incredibly) poor lack of communication on the side management, is this normal? Can a company just change your schedule permanently with razor thin notification? I understand that it can be up to company policy, which can vary, but it seems there may be some basic labor law which would help guide companies in these situations.

I've encouraged my husband to speak to his union rep about the short notice and lack of communication but I'm not sure if that would really help or result in anything positive for him and others

I work for a small branch in FL however the company I work for is based out of state.  All of the hirer ups including the main HR rep work for the main office, so I don't have a personal relationship with them however there is a higher authority to lodge the complaint to.  

I've been with this company for a long time and worked very hard to get to the position that I am in I don't want to put my job in jeopardy, I'm actually fighting very hard to keep it.  Unfortunately, my experience has been that as much as my extended time with this company has added value to what I do in experience it's also shined a spotlight on my flaws as well callouts / excessive breaks add up and turn into big things.  So I was recently sick and per company, policy messaged the hotline saying I would not be in for some reason they did not see the message and my HR rep called me screaming (I mean I heald the phone a few feet away and I could hear her perfectly clear) saying that if I wanted to keep my job I had to get there now.  Upon arriving I was screamed at more than written up for a no call no show even when I tried to show her the message  I sent she wouldn't look at it just proceeded to scream at me saying how close to being fired I was and wrote me up (honestly the fact that she wouldn't look at the proof that I did reach out and wrote me up anyway seems like a problem to me but that's neither here nor there) on the write up form there were certain stipulations one of which was monitoring the breaks I had to sign out and back in every time I left the office.  I have been following these stipulations however one extremely busy day I verbally told my managers I was taking my SCHEDULED 30 min break they acknowledged but I forgot to sign out on the sheet.  

When I got back from my break she immediately confronted me in front of the whole office screaming ""Why didn't you sign out?  Don't you understand how close to being fired you are!  We had no idea where you were"" even after apologizing and informing her I told my managers before I left, that it was my scheduled break she continued screaming in front of the whole office a ""That's not good enough!   You're so close to being fired!  Do you even want this job at all?""  I understand it's her job to reprimand me but is it really ok to scream at staff about being fired in front of the whole office?  There are more professional ways to handle this behind closed doors with level voices. 

The problem is this is just the most recent outburst.  It's not a personal problem it's not just me, it is anyone who's in her path when she's in a bad mood.  She regularly loses it screaming at the staff, breaking them down to tears in some cases.   However, we are all afraid of filing a complaint as she is the HR director for our office... definitely not someone you want to have a personal vendetta against you.  I am afraid to file a complaint as it's a right to work state she would only need the smallest violation to let me go.  At the same time considering everyone else has this fear nothing will ever be done about the way she is treating people if I don't speak up.  

If this were your company would you want to be alerted of this behavior?  Or would you scrutinize the employee that submitted the complaint?  My understanding is HR is there to help the company, not the employees and believing otherwise has caused huge problems for me in the past I don't want to make that mistake again.  It just seems to me that an authority figure of any kind representing the company and acting this way is a problem for the company as much as it is for the employees.

I initially did not want it, but was offered compensation that made-up for the changes. Previously I had a team that was fairly evenly spread ‚Äì about 50/50 men and women, but this new team, which is composed of designers, photographers and MARCOM is probably 80% female. The previous director couldn‚Äôt effectively manage the team, leading to serious delays and cost overruns, often subcontracting  as much as 50% of her portfolio, despite having one of the largest teams in our division. After her ouster, the team was chilly and the first two months were very difficult. Things have only marginally improved. 

The team is large but dysfunctional. The division is split among two offices in the city, and aren't in physical proximity. I tend to split my time to give both groups equal face time and try and engage as much as possible, but that hasn't seemed to help. What I‚Äôve been struggling with most is having direct conversations with my managers. When talking with FP&A or my own team, I seem to have no problems: I‚Äôm to-the-point, facts driven and calm. With accountants or statisticians, that works, but with photographers or creative types, it almost always winds-up in tears. I want to stick to facts and get straight answers, I‚Äôm not someone who is prone to yelling or raising my voice and I‚Äôm very careful to remain positive and polite, no matter how off the rails a conversation is going. That said, I'm not interested in a prolonged story about how getting your dog shaved resulted in spilling hot Ramen on your BF's jeans.

Case in point: I had a meeting with a MARCOM manager who was supposed to send in drafts of materials to be launched in early 2020, but instead we‚Äôre now ‚Äúmonths‚Äù behind. I simply said: ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù and that was enough to start the waterworks. If I sit there stoically, it makes it worse. If I offer them a tissue but ask to proceed, it gets worse. A few managers complained to HR who called me in with my boss and asked me to find better ways to communicate with female staff. The VP was incensed he was being bothered with their (as he put it) faff and left. HR wasn‚Äôt helpful with a strategy. I later spoke to my boss about the situation and he waved me off saying he had complete confidence and told me to get the results we need. I‚Äôm at my breaking-point. We‚Äôve only marginally improved productivity and costs are still too high. I need to figure-out how to talk to these people or I‚Äôll be left with the option-of-last-resort, which no one wants. I‚Äôm struggling to handle this. In my conversations with people in other units/departments, everything is great and we get along just fine. In my conversations with Creative, I‚Äôm apparently a massive a\*hole. I'm so stressed out about this that I can't sleep. I need results, but every way I approach this is wrong and I can't ever seem to get a straight answer from anyone.

Documenting everything in toxic workplace. What is acceptable? When to submit?,AskHR,2,derzny,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/derzny/documenting_everything_in_toxic_workplace_what_is/,5,1570521252.0,"Hello,

I have some questions about CYA and documenting in the workplace.  I am documenting some of the conversations and issues that have happened at my workplace that are affecting my job and mental health.  Is using a Word document to track conversation good enough?  I also have emails and text messages that contradict some of the complaints about me as well as go deeper into the issues.  I don't know when I should submit this information to HR or if it will even matter.  HR told me there was nothing they could do about the toxic work environment but they want me to come talk to them since I haven't in months.  Is it worth it? 

Last year when I went to HR nothing came from it.  I think maybe I should keep my documents until I leave but what will that do? I'm being lied on and the top manager refuses to do anything to her favorite and takes her side. I feel like HR just wants to know what's going to make sure I'm not suing but won't really help the situation.  They said before they would get management training and possibly demote the two managers that are causing the trouble, but haven't done anything yet.  Should I give them my log now, or wait until I'm leaving? I have documented some of the racial remarks and bullying that have occurred.  My manager has even threatened someone.  In my log, I have documented things that have happened to or been said to me and others.  do I just need to stick to what affects me, no matter if I hear or see what happens to another person?  Also, do I need to hear first hand what someone says?  My supervisor will come to our one on one and tell me things that others have said about me and I document the conversations.  Is this okay even though I wasn't there or heard it?  I am in Missouri, which is an at-will state.  Just worried that I may be let go without any warning and won't have a chance to protect myself.

For the past fifteen years I have been a subcontractor for a US based tech company (I am based in Canada).  My job for thirteen of those fifteen years was to implement their software for clients.  (That's a simple explanation of my job). I am also one of the only two Canadians (I'm in Quebec) in the company, and the only French speaking (we have Canadian clients).


Two years ago, the umbrella company hired two people to work in the US office as executives to help cut costs as well as improve our operations/sales etc.  After these two execs got settled in their new positions, they heard about ""the Canadians"" and wanted to meet with us, as we both worked for this company longer than anyone else currently at the company.  The meeting resulted in them wanting to hire me to run the department I was currently subcontracting in.  I was given more money, more responsibilities and basically treated like an employee while remaining on paper a subcontractor.

I flourished in my new position helping streamline training, writing up manuals, dealing with top clients.  The two execs began relying on me for many difficult decisions, many of which were not even in my department.  I was the happiest professionally I had ever been in my life.  I was on my way to running operations for the entire US company.  

Unfortunately these two execs only lasted a year and were replaced by two other execs from the EU umbrella company.  As soon as they came in, I was ""demoted"" back down to my original position in my dept (still earning the same money though) and most of my responsibilities were taken from me.  I was never told why.  It just started to happen as weeks and months went on.

Side note: As I began to work my way up in the company, at the time I got my promotion, I was working alongside someone from the US.  We both were tasked with running the same department.  We worked well as a team - or so I thought.  As our two execs began to lean on me more, my US counterpart (let's call him Joe) became jealous and even threatened to sue me twice due to ""insubordination"". I kept all this quiet and dealt with it personally by speaking to him.  We mended our relationship but things were never the same.  I feel he was/is threatened by me.  

When the UK execs came on board, ""Joe"" would often tell me things from meetings he would have with the execs.  Things like ""Exec A thinks you're incompetent"" or ""Exec B never wants you reaching out to them, only to me"", to name a few.  When I confronted said Execs, they denied ever saying those things.  

Fast forward to Friday afternoon.  I receive an email from ""Joe"" where the subject reads: ""KodoPodo Risk Assessment"".  My email address is filled in the ""To"" field, and Exec B is CCed.  The document attached lists my duties, the clients I work with as well as what those clients bring in annually, if I could afford to live without my salary, etc.  It is clear by the email that I was never meant to see this and that is was only directed to Exec B.

If you've stayed with me things long, I'm finally getting to my question: What do I do with this?  Did Joe do this on purpose?  Do I reply to this email?   

Second side note: I have wanted to leave this company for a while now as I feel they have done nothing but push me down and keep me down.  I went from being their best worker to one who is depressed and unmotivated.  If I'm honest here, I feel they just don't deserve me.  

Thank you for reading and I would appreciate any and all thoughts/advice."

I looked at him shocked and then disengaged. Ultimately he was wrong and we were on the right train. I'm looking for a new job and will leave when I get one. But I'm interested how you'd approach this and your perspective. 

I'm quite introverted and come off cold at times (something I need to work on), and don't participate in the 'ladish' banter that occurs or the numerous afterworks drinks, as I dislike drinking, and like to go home and relax after work, or go do some exercise.

Not a great opportunity, less than 30 hours and my hours are being stretched into 5 days. I am the only person in my section (small section) and the store manager who hired me does the ordering and helps. So after a month and half, he has not given me much of training, he is putting one of the section leaders to show me and sadly she acts bossy, always asking for my help so she won't have to do much of stocking and such. And she always states the obvious as an instruction, like... I know there are many kids who work there but I am not a kid and have had many more jobs where I learned more. 

So today, the girl told me that the store manager put her as a lead for my section and she used a tone implying that she is gonna be ordering me even more from now on. I asked her if performance is poor and that is why this is happening and she said no, she has to do the orders items he has been doing.  At this point since I am the only person in my section, I thought I would become the lead.

I believe I am pretty good at what I am doing but I have a feeling the store manager is not satisfied with my work and that is why he is not bothering to teach me. I am also worried because I am still on my probation period and what if he fires me once I reach that period using performance as an excuse?

I feel like I'm being under payed and that it's not worth it. Everyone else gets almost double what I am now getting. The dissapointment just continues and I feel extremely unhappy.

Our direction was that because sick leave is a state benefit, they cannot be disciplined for using it nor can they be negatively impacted in their evaluation.

Our agency requires lots of mandatory overtime. Some staff work on weekends. Some have figured out that they can work overtime early in the week, then call in sick on the weekends, and never touch their sick time. Now we cannot hold them accountable, even if they were to do this every single week.

HR says this is a result of a court ruling out of the 9th circuit court of appeals. Anyone else seeing this? This seems crazy to me. People are already starting to take advantage of the fact that they're untouchable."
Choosing between two job offers,AskHR,2,de5m7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/de5m7w/choosing_between_two_job_offers/,3,1570408657.0," 

Hello, Reddit!

I just moved to Seattle a few years ago from Toronto, and my husband I are loving it! Making the decision to move was the best decision I ever made. I'm definitely not risk averse considering I literally country hopped, but I'm all about making calculated risks. Both positions are in Seattle and I would not need to relocate for either one.

Anyway, my husband is in the logistics industry, and has an excellent benefits package so insurance isn't a deciding factor in either of these offers. I can't believe that I'm in the position of choosing between two dream jobs, so please excuse me while I pinch myself.

**Offer 1:** Totally my dream job at a tech start up as a recruiting program manager. I accepted the offer last week, thinking I would not hear back on offer 2. I'd be one of the first employees, and my responsibilities would be growing the company from 2 to 50 in approximately three years. Along the way I'll also be exposed to HR projects including benefits administration, training and development and I'd imagine so much more. Making the leap here is extremely risky because of how new the start up is, but if it succeeds, the upside is huge, including significant equity and experience in HR that I cannot get in a traditional recruiting role. My biggest attraction to the role is the HR exposure - I don't want to be a recruiter forever, and this opportunity could be the bridge to a more strategic HR role in the future. They are offering me a competitive base salary and equity.

**Offer 2:** The role would be a Senior Executive Recruiter at the number one firm globally in its industry. They are offering me 45% more than the tech start up and 50% more than I'm earning now) but on a contract basis. The ability to convert as an FTE is there, but it takes a LONG time. I've wanted to get my foot in the door with this company since I was in high school, because I knew that I would be able to retire here. The relationship management aspect of this role is really exciting for me, as I'd be working in partnership with executives and senior leaders to fill their open vacancies. However, I am afraid that if I accept this offer, then I am defining myself as a recruiter. While this company has a huge Talent Acquisition program and I could potentially move laterally down the road if I wanted to, I am concerned that I won't be able to work on projects outside my lane, thereby limiting my growth. Even though it's a contract role, I feel that this is a much more stable position.

I'd love to hear your thoughts. Please let me know if you need any additional details."

Can my employer pull my health insurance because of my ADA accommodation?

It has over 60 employees, so ADA laws apply.

Recently, in order to accommodate my disability, they have allowed a temporary modified schedule with reduced hours. Because of that, they say they are now prorating my health insurance based on the hours I work per week, as they would an intermittent employee. They are also saying that if I go below a certain amount of hours one week, I won't qualify for health insurance that month.

The thing is, in the employee handbook, no category of employee has their prorated rates based on week per week, even part time or intermittent. It is set based on an estimate. So they are applying an unwritten, inferior policy to only me and no one else in the entire company. 

The main clincher is that they have not reclassified me as anything other than a regular full time employee, and the say they will not. According to the handbook, it says health insurance will be paid out at 100% for anyone classified as a full time employee. So they are going against their own handbook by applying a different set of rules to me. 

I've already pushed back and said I will take legal action as necessary. I've explained to them that as someone with a disability, health insurance is unfortunately the hill I have to die on. 

Still, I feel so yucky having to do this. Is my company wrong, or am I?"

Also if anyone could suggest a group to go see about this that isn't overly expensive that would be helpful as well. We considered talking to the companies HR department but we are afraid of showing what our intentions are.

TL;DR: ex-boyfriend transferring to my store, cannot face going to work if he is there. What should I do?

I work for the same company (retail store) as my ex-boyfriend. We were already in a relationship when I started working there - he‚Äôs worked there longer than me - and we‚Äôve always worked in separate branches as he is more senior than me and the company has a rule where people in a relationship can not be in any form of line management chain with each other.

Following a serious long term relationship where we lived together for a number of years, we had a horrendous breakup a few years ago. I won‚Äôt go into detail but it happened very suddenly and I sought counselling and support through the company‚Äôs employee wellbeing service. The management team at my store are well aware of the effect this had on me and how I feel about my ex-boyfriend, and I have actively avoided all contact with him inside or out of work since then. Fortunately our paths have not crossed but I am very anxious about bumping into him at staff meetings or company events so always check whether he is attending before I agree to attend. 

I returned to work from a week‚Äôs leave today to be told that one of the management team from my store has transferred to his store, and as a result he is being transferred to my store next week. I am completely shocked by this and feel sick at the thought of going to work and him being there. 

The HR team are not available until Monday but I would really appreciate some guidance before then as I‚Äôm in a state of complete panic at the moment. 

I cannot stress enough the effect that this person being in my workplace will have on my mental health. Is there any likelihood that the move could be blocked on this basis?

I feel completely let down by my management team as they are well aware of everything I‚Äôve described above and have still gone ahead with this decision. 

I absolutely cannot be in the same location as him, so I am thinking about other short term solutions. When I speak to HR I will offer to work from another location until this is resolved, but I don‚Äôt want this to become a permanent arrangement because I don‚Äôt feel I should be the one to be displaced by this situation. As a last resort I can request some annual leave but again this feels unfair (and might not be authorised). I don‚Äôt want to end up in a situation where I have unauthorised absences or appear unprofessional in my response to the situation, but I also really need to look after myself and my wellbeing.

Any advice or guidance would be really appreciated."

I know the solution would be to fire this employee but unfortunately, the big boss is dragging his feet on pulling the trigger. I am the office manager/supervisor in addition to my other job duties. I am stuck with this employee for now.

We work in a small office, only 4 staff members. We have had issues with our receptionist for several months. Write ups, threats of termination, threats of hiring someone to take over her job duties, and the like are met with literal shrugged shoulders. It does not matter how many times she is spoken to, nothing changes. The issues we are having range from watching YouTube at the front desk, to not telling anyone when she is taking time off, to deciding not to do tasks because she doesnt feel like it. The front desk is a mess. Client documents have been lost. Files are not up to date. Some client information (who hired us in June!) havent even made it to Outlook.

Since June, we have had 4 meetings with her regarding things that need to change. At this point, I am convinced that she has something on the boss because she seems invincible. Recent incidents include not coming to me with questions on my files but instead asking other people in the office who have no knowledge of my files. The reason she will not talk to me is because she thinks I am mean because I am correcting her constantly. When we had our last meeting, she was asked by the boss what I could do better to help her out and make sure that she is able to do her job. Her response was ""nothing"". She refuses to give any insight as to why she won't do her job and tells everyone that she has it under control and she clearly doesnt. I have since watched my tone and only been correcting the big mistakes but I am still met with reports that I am mean and treating her like she is stupid.

At this point, I am stuck with this employee. Moving her to a different job will not happen as she is not qualified to do anything else. I have done write-ups, PIPs and everything else I can think of. My stress level is through the roof because the boss comes down on me when things are not getting done since I am the supervisor and I do not have the time to do her job along with mine. I have never had an employee who is straight up insubordinate. Since all of the conventional methods have not worked, what can I do to keep my sanity and keep me from getting reamed out?"

I have an opportunity for a really interesting job in another city at a hospital affiliated with a prestigious medical school.  I have almost 20 years in the industry, my skills and abilities really are a perfect fit.  I also have about 15 years left to work and I think I could really do well and enjoy myself at this organization for those 15 years.  

They have invited me for an in-person interview in this distant city.  I have to pay for it, but if I get the job I will be reimbursed.  Also it‚Äôs a salary increase, but the cost of living in this city is a little higher than Denver so not really a huge increase and they **do not** help pay for relocation.

I am a medical records analyst; though I have a Master's degree in healthcare IT and a handful of professional certifications, I am not a physician or a director or part of C-suite management.  People I have talked to say it's weird they are not willing to pay for me to go out to the interview, but ok possible reimbursement is interesting; however its total BS they won't pay for relocation.  

Is that true?  I thought no one got relocation packages these days unless they are in the C-Suite.  I have fully explored the job market in Denver in my specialty and its completely dry.  I think I need to be flexible and go where the work is, and it‚Äôs a really good job.  I don‚Äôt think I can get away with playing hardball for an analyst position and I don‚Äôt want to lose the opportunity.  

Perhaps if I totally WOW them at the in-person interview and they make an offer, I can negotiate for the highest possible salary since I am relocating.  And I have said already ""I would really appreciate at least a little help with the relocation"" thinking even a few thousand dollars would be great.

What is the industry standard for relocation?  Is there one, or is it really truly dependent on the institution?  Is healthcare different than traditional for-profit business?  Most hospitals are non-profit.

My coworker (Male 40) worked on the servers for a City that has over 1,000 employees. He has passed a Police Department background check and has grants access to PD files and City Attorney files etc. I (Female28) worked as an assistant in the IT Department. 

About four months ago I sent HR an old email of me telling him he can‚Äôt tell me he is going to harass or follow me and not stop when I tell him to stop. A month before he did that, he yelled at me twice in one day and I said no to him for the first time about something he wanted me to do. He convinced me that I hurt him because ‚Äúwe had a better relationship than that‚Äù and that everyone in the department thought I was ridiculous and people in the office needed time to get over what I did before they would be ready to talk to me again. I believed him. He was always very kind and helpful before all of this. 

I later found out that what he said wasn‚Äôt true. Three people that overheard our conversation in the office came up to me on their own and told me he was wrong, how he was treating me wasn‚Äôt OK, I was doing my job. My coworker (M40) told me not to talk about him and later told me again I hadn‚Äôt learned my lesson because I was still talking about him. He continued to gaslight me and do bizarre things to me the last three months I worked there. He kept on telling me he treated me differently because I was his friend. 

I went to my boss on at least 5 occasions about this but he said things like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what you heard but probably not what he said‚Äù ‚Äúyou have to ask yourself what you were doing to make him react that way‚Äù ‚Äúsometimes people say things they don‚Äôt mean when they are angry‚Äù ‚Äúeverything will be fine in two weeks‚Äù ‚Äúdon‚Äôt go to the Department Head about this‚Äù ‚ÄúCome to me about this‚Äù

The coworker later sent me an email explaining  he was treating me badly because he couldn‚Äôt get over the day he yelled at me and I disagreed with him. 

I am supposed to meet with a third party investigator next Tuesday. She doesn‚Äôt know who either of us are. What is going to happen? What is an investigation like? How is it different since he works for the Police Department? What is going to happen to me after I tell them what happened? What should I expect and what should I do? 

I just wanted to let HR know he does and says these sorts of things because I want the next person he might do this to to be believed. 

I‚Äôve been in Trauma therapy since January because of this. I have PTSD. I used to regularly have panic attacks, be in fight/flight/freeze mode, feel scared most of the time etc. my whole view of human nature was shattered. It‚Äôs hard to trust people when he was so kind and caring for three years and then did something so inhumane to me. He is supposed to have one of the most trustworthy positions in the entire city. His job is to literally keep information safe. I didn‚Äôt think he would lie to me. 

He was mentally abusive, isolated me from others, intimidating, lied to me, and was controlling the last three months I worked there. It was a nightmare. He gaslit me a lot.

I‚Äôm in finance with 20 year experience, all the scenarios and questions I answered flawlessly. 

So she asks how much I‚Äôm looking for. I consider myself great in bouncing the question back to them so I have to disclose my salary requirements but I had to disclose and give her a vague range ( making up numbers USD). I tell her ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in the low to mid $200‚Äôs‚Äù. And seems shocked. She says that their budget is $160K -$180K.

I want to follow up with an email but not sure how. I need help. Any ideas? I want to say basically:
1.  The opportunity is something I can contribute towards and bring my skills. 
2.  I feel we are close enough on salary that I‚Äôd like to continue the interview process. 

I feel if she comes back and asks me ‚Äúwill u b ok with $180k?‚Äù  I can say, I rather discuss the salary or wait for your final offer after i meet with the hiring manager(cfo) and let them determine what they feel i will be worth with the experience i bring.

Need your advice. 

I have worked for my company for 10 plus years in company located in Alberta state in Canada. I work in small branch office in alberta and was first one to open it for them apart from the head office in another city which is in Alberta Canada as well. It's an 80 employee company over all. The company have been making lots of changes lately and many hire ups either have left or were let go. 

Recently the leadership decided to close the small branch office in my city ( only 2 employees here - me as senior tech and tech lead and another guy as junior tech ) .

They gave us both letter stating due to economic conditions in our city here in Alberta they are closing this branch office. Two options for us : a. Move back to head office city and continue same job  b. Take lay off  
We got two weeks to decide.

I am most likely going to pick lay off because I got family kids and house and just cannot afford to move for those reasons. Economic conditions in my home town are extremely bad to be bake to find job at this time. They are going to announce this big news in the town hall  entire company attends and let them know. I know employees will be shocked to hear that especially because I have great image in the company, leadership and I am also team lead of few employees. When they will announce this I am sure everyone will start looking at me as I will be there physically as well.

I need to prepare for a small  positive speech to give in front of entire company portraying this move by management in a positive manner so that the moral of my team and entire company doesn't get affected. This speech may also solidify my image in front if leadership even though they are letting me go.  

Can you try to give me few words or sample liners / advice that I can use in this important speech of my career ? Although I will be accepting a lay off I do not want the moral of other employees go down because they look up to me and others may be scared about their jobs too.

Boss spreading damaging false rumors,AskHR,5,dcv3uw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/dcv3uw/boss_spreading_damaging_false_rumors/,9,1570156824.0,"Kentucky, USA

TLDR at end;

I'll do my best to long story short this.  I work in IT in a laboratory.  Our department is generally seen as a Neutral Zone, whereas all the different lab departments are their own kingdom and don't always get along.  We're also very friendly and outgoing, so people often come to us with their grievances looking for advice, and also come to our office to vent.

Therefor, it is not uncommon for someone to come into our office and see an individual besides the two people that work in the I.T. department taking their break in our office.  Being a laboratory, there are also few ""clean"" places where people are allowed to eat.  We do have a break room, but many people choose to eat their lunches in their offices if they are allowed.  We do the same in IT, and have a handful (usually 1-3 people) that choose to eat lunch with us in our department.

It's been this way for the last 4 to 5 years, and has never been a problem.  Fast forward to last week, and I get a call to meet with my boss and the main manager of the lab.  I start getting grief about having multiple people in my office at all hours, and always having food laying out attracting mice.  He says it's a problem that I have to fix, and I have to order people out of our department unless it's strictly business related or between the hours of 12-1pm (lunch time).  Even though he says he has absolutely no complaints about the work we do, our timeliness, etc.  None of this has to do with our own work coming out of I.T.  He said ""some people have complained"".

The issue is, there are two people at the lab that are the constant squeaky wheel and they don't like the I.T. department on a personal level, and go out of their way to make us look bad.  So these two people go down there, and tell him god knows what, and he takes it at face value and as fact, and I can't convince him otherwise. Our conversation gets heated a bit as I try to defend myself to his outlandish accusations, but in the end, he is my boss, and I acquiesce that while I don't fully agree with him, he is my boss, and it's my job to do what he says, and that I will not stoop to the level of other individuals at the lab and be insubordinate or start screaming at him like a lunatic (a common problem at our lab).

A side note, the two individuals that kinda have it in for us in I.T., one of them has two employees that have been witnessed in our department before, and they apparently don't like it.  We'll call them Employee 1 (Emp1) and Employee 2 (Emp2), their direct supervisor/boss (Boss1) and that bosses friend (BossFr), the boss and friend being the two that dislike IT and are the squeaky wheel to the lab manager.  Emp1 is spotted in our office during her break by BossF.  BossF marches down to Boss1 to tell them about it.  When Emp1 returns to their department, Boss1 informs them that they shouldn't spend time in I.T. because they are interrupting our work.  Which is wholly untrue.  Emp2 a week later is spotted in our office by BossF during her break, Emp2 is in our office maybe 2-3 minutes total.  But BossF marches back down to Boss1 and tells them.  When Emp2 returns to her department, Boss1 informs her that ""multiple people have complained about you being in IT"", again, wholly untrue.  This was maybe a few weeks before my own talk with the lab mananger.

After my meeting with the lab manager and my acquiescing to his demands, I go and personally talk to the individuals (or message them if they weren't there) that be spotted in our department.  So we're talking 3  regulars, and 3 people that might be in our department once every 2 weeks.  I tell them the situation, that Lab Manager doesn't want people in our department, and that they can only be in there between the hours of 12-1 unless it's strictly work related (also this new rule ONLY applies to our department, and no other area in the building).  Literally, every single one of them, immediately respond with ""because of Boss1 and Bossf?"" because they know how things are around here.

Anyways, so let's get to my main issue I am having now.  One of the people that once took some of their breaks in our office has a meeting with lab manager over something work related, and he brings up the issue with the I.T. department, and let's lab manager know how silly he thought it was, and that there was no problem to fix.  Lab Manager then tells this individual, that I.T. was ""constantly having parties in their office, and that we have mice in the lab now because they have food out in the open"".  Both of which are completely untrue. One, no one in their right mind would say we have parties in our office.  At worst we might have 6 people (including ourselves) during lunch time because we are friends and like to eat together.  As for the food thing, we had things like fruit (bananas, orange, in their skins still), and maybe a bag of gummy bears in a sealed bag.  Pretty much everyone in the lab has food in their office in similar fashion.  And the best part of it all?  The mice we recently got in the lab, even though we get mice every year, was in Boss1's office, way on the other side of the building.  And yet I.T. is being blamed for it.

This is my main issue.  My direct boss, and the manager of the entire lab is spreading false rumors about our department, and I have no clue what to do about it.  Talking to him is like talking to a brick wall of willful ignorance, and I don't know if I can talk to him without things getting heated and putting my future in this job in jeopardy. 

I also feel like we are being singled out, picked on, and treated with unfair bias.  You ask me, a few individuals in the know, the past 3 I.T. Manager, and last 1 IT employee, and every single one of them will tell you that the Lab Manager treats I.T. unfairly and differently to the rest of the lab.  Aka, any slight and we get reemed for it, while others throughout the lab basically commit murder without a finger lifted.

TLDR; Main labs boss did not like it that a small group of people would take their breaks in our department, irregardless of whether the same goes on in other areas. Ordered me not to allow it to happen, and I acquiesced to his demands as he is my boss.  But this boss is now spreading false rumors to other people around that we were constantly ""having parties"" in our department at all hours, and because we have food in our department (as pretty much every other ""clean area"" does), it's the reason the lab has mice, which oddly enough are in other departments with food on the other side of the building."

HR looked at me a little bit surprised (as if I asked too much), said she wasn't the decision maker but will note down my expectations. But that ultimately they will look at market rate and internal salaries (for equality reasons) to come up with a number.

The next day I get a call from HR telling me they are offering me a salary at the highest end of my salary expectations, which is definitely above market (I get fairly consistent estimations from 3rd party recruiters and alumnis on the same field), along with really good benefits.

What most likely happened ? Can this be a mistake (e.g. hiring manager said ""Give him an offer at the extreme of his expectations"" and HR thought he meant higher while he meant lower) ? Technical interviews and director interviews went perfectly (in fact they told me they would make an offer before the end of the interview, before clearly telling me they are going to convince me why I should come over. 30 minutes interview turned to a 2-hour interview), but I'm surprised they are willing to go that high. I'm a fresh grad with no exp, granted I had an internship at a prestigious company. I'm also the only junior in a very specialized team, could this have played into it since the only comparaison points are my senior managers ?

She asked me whether if I have any troubles in fitting in with my colleagues after being fired and she said that she will get involved if things get serious regarding my sudden disappearance. She offered me a backstory to explain my disappearance. I told her that I haven't mentioned anyone regarding my removal but people guessed it as I met some of my colleagues during summer classes and beginning of fall quarter. I told her that if anyone asked me, I don't mind telling them what happened in a professional and mature manner because denying it can be more cringe. And people that actually know me will ask for my disappearance. 

She asked me for my availabilities and invited me for the introductory tutors meet-and-greet! I got the job!

Hiring Manager here; need assistance.,AskHR,3,dcmttt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/dcmttt/hiring_manager_here_need_assistance/,2,1570111488.0,"My repost from r/jobs 

Hopefully this is the right forum for this type of question, if not I would appreciate a point in the right direction. 

I assist my store by handling administrative tasks such as hiring. I help manage a retail establishment and we have traditionally relied on Indeed for applications. 

Usually this is good enough but recently, in the past year, about 85%-90% of applicants either don't respond to offers via phone or email or they set up an interview and never follow through. 

I'm racking my brain trying to think of other ways to proactively search out talent, enough to get a potential candidate in front of me for an interview. I feel as if waiting for an application that has a 10% chance average to show up is not adequate for our business needs. 

I'm hoping some other retail managers or otherwise could share some tips on proactive hiring. How you go about it and what your success stories are. Any help would be appreciated. 

TL;DR Hiring manager tired of relying on unsuccessful current means of hiring, seeking more proactive approach to seeking talent. 

Thanks again, any tips are welcomed."
Imposing limits on open door policy complaints...?,AskHR,4,dckjvi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/dckjvi/imposing_limits_on_open_door_policy_complaints/,8,1570097750.0,"Hi! 

I‚Äôm from RI, and my retail employer has an open door policy. I know i have made an unusual number of HR complaints, BUT it has also always been founded. 

Yesterday, two underage teen employees mentioned that a late-20s coworker showed them a picture of him performing anallingus on a woman. 

My manager came to me today after the manager on duty told him what I reported, and he was basically saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a good look.‚Äù 

Despite the fact that none of my complaints were unfounded. Is it possible for me to get in trouble for utilizing the open door policy too often regardless of veracity of my complaints?

Update:

The first complaint was because I, then in my early 20s (now 25), was being harassed by a nearly-70 year old janitor who was harassing me by phone, internet, and at work, including following me home, for over three years. It was unresolved because he left for health reasons immediately afterward.

Then, a year after that, I complained three separate times about a 50 year old manager openly trying to seduced a 16 year old cashier that he called hot after attempts to sleep with other female associates between 19 and 44 failed. Although 16 is RI‚Äôs age of consent, it‚Äôs wildly unethical and inappropriate, and our store manager was... politely, non confrontational. It kept escalating, and management was reprimanded for how they handled my third complaint, because the first two were investigated and found to be legit.

Recently, I complained, in conjunction with several other employees about a new hire (40+ gay male) who is extremely touchy-feely, but also said inappropriate things to and about multiple minors. Management had witnessed and elected not to pursue because its minor compared to our other issues right now. 

I directly witnessed or experience all or majority parts of what I list above.

This complaint, though within a few months of the one involving the gay man who touches/says inappropriate things... is also something I‚Äôve personally witnessed or experienced, or the teens came to me seeking response because they don‚Äôt know what to do. I referred these complaints all to management first, and the person who showed the images to multiple teens ALSO blatantly uses drugs on the clock, and he has repeatedly been reprimanded for touching people or their possessions."

However I did notify the HR office that it‚Äôs possible I will need more time due to the failed surgery and she asked me to call her office asap.

I have my surgery and I am informed that it was a failed attempt due to kidney inflammation and abnormal kidney structure. This would require a second attempt in 4 weeks. I am unable to return to work during this time due to an external tube placement that would need to stay until the next attempt. I am in week 2 post first attempt and am awaiting a new date to be set for the second attempt. This is my first salary job and my boyfriend and I are worrying ourselves crazy. Should I be worried about being let go due to the extended leave?

"Need advice on possible harassment (Wisconsin, USA)",AskHR,5,dcigqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/dcigqq/need_advice_on_possible_harassment_wisconsin_usa/,1,1570087480.0,"Hello everyone, new guy here. I've been experiencing some harassment/bullying at my job since January of 2018. I've read the EEOC definition of harassment, but it seems to me like it only is legally considered harassment if it is based upon age, sex, religion, race, nationality, genetic information, color, disability, etc. I'm wondering if my current situation would still be considered harassment, even though it isn't really based on either of those things, and what kind of advice you all  can give me. I shall explain:

I work on a large scale baler machine that bales all different kinds of metals. A lot of the material has to be sorted through, to get any kind of non conforming material out to make the bale as clean as possible. (For example, you don't want any kind of steel or brass in a bale of high grade sheet aluminium). Besides me, there are 2 other workers in the area, the loader operator that uses the tractor bucket to pick up material and spread it out so I can check it, and operator who sits at the control panel for the baler and presses the buttons to make it work (the conveyor belt, the crusher, the strapping machine). At the end of each day, I turn in the production report to the baler operator. My problem is with the operator of the baler, not the loader operator.

This machine operator has continually screamed in my face because I didn't understand him (he doesn't speak very good English). One time during my initial training, he threw an aluminum radiator weighing about 30-40 pounds at me because I didn't realize at the time that it needed to be segregated from the rest of the material. He has purposefully hoarded my production reports from my supervisor in an attempt to try and make it seem like I wasn't fulfilling that duty of my job.  He has come up to me randomly without any provocation and said that when he fights people he ""doesn't stop and needs at least 2 guys to pull him off of someone."" He has insulted me, saying that ""I don't know anything"" and has called be ""cabron"" which is dumbass in Spanish. One time when we finished running copper pipes, I went to the restroom and he quickly cleaned out the machine of any remaining copper, and started baling aluminum cans, so when I got back I had to bend down and sort the copper and cans from each other by hand instead of being able to just shovel the copper into a metal container used for the remains.

I have documented going to HR twice now (once in February 2019, and once in July 2019). The other guy that works with us is one of the union stewards in the yard and I made him aware of my intentions of going to HR both times, and he conversed with them on both occasions. Nothing has been done. My supervisor is also aware of this behavior. So are my fellow co-workers, whom have remarked on their similar experiences with this same person, and none of them want to work down in our area because he gives them the same type of behavior.

I'm at a loss as to what to do. I know most people would say to just get another job, but this place pays well and I have good standing with literally everyone else in the company, including the yard manager, who is above my supervisor. I like working with metals and learning about them. Do you guys think I have a good legal case? What do you think I should do? Any advice I greatly appreciate."
Understanding HR Lingo Regarding Stalker Report,AskHR,4,dcj9cx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/dcj9cx/understanding_hr_lingo_regarding_stalker_report/,4,1570091270.0,"Located in the U.S.

Some time ago, I had reported a stalker to my manager, furnishing all relevant documentation, including a protection order. The workplace is locked behind an employee security card, but the jobs are entry-level, low-skill and something my stalker could easily apply to just to get access to me (they even have a college degree to boot). It's worth noting that I have done my due diligence to ensure my employment is confidential, but as you are aware of, stalkers are persistent and the risk can never be fully mitigated. My manager got back from HR and told me that my stalker, if they ever apply, will be ineligible for hire.

Fast forward to recently, and I requested this resolution in writing from HR. They responded something to the effect of, ""I can't answer your question (on whether the individual is ineligible for hire), but we have noted the individual. If you notice they are pursuing employment with us, please contact us.""

Is there some weird limitation that prevents HR from telling me directly that my stalker is ineligible for hire, and they're trying their best to communicate under those limitations? How should I interpret this in the context of my safety in the workplace?"

First time poster, etc., etc.,... sorry for length TL;DR at bottom. 

I'm based out of Seattle area, Washington. 

I recently interviewed for a large employer in my city in my dream department. They reached out to me for a role that was not publicly posted, but tied to internal projects mandated recently by our government (think major policy and protocol upgrades we do every 5-10 years in my industry). After having a wonderful time with the interview rounds with positive feedback that this was a good fit, and providing references, I was sent internal documents including the benefits packages, salary details, code of conduct, etc, and forms to sign promising I would not travel in the first 6 months from my given start date (typical for my industry). 

I was told the last step was to finish reaching out to my references and to shake some hands before my start date so higher ups would have a face to a name when I joined the team. Great!

I was getting other offers in for similar positions but not the same level of dreamy-ness, but I did not want to string along these other offers if I was just waiting for bureaucracy and scheduling with my dream job. I asked the dream job HR rep for a conditional offer so I could feel secure in next steps with dream job and truthfully say to other offers that I was already taken by a position. The HR rep seemed surprised I would ask for such a thing, but said that they would follow up. Many senior colleagues told me that a conditional offer in this case would not be out of left field for my skill set and how project teams are set up, they were surprised with HR's surprised response, as was I. 

A few days later, I received notice from the HR rep that funding for the position had been pulled, indefinitely. This means there was no point in me coming in for meet & greets, etc. I thanked them for consideration and moved on to the other offers after all. 

Is this normal or did the request for conditional offer scare them? How could they send me internal documents if they hadn't finalised funding for the position? Funding I would think to be the first step before hiring for a position?

TL;DR: Did I spoke HR with requesting a conditional offer for a position was funding was legit pulled last minute and the position terminated?"

I have depression, anxiety, and a sleep disorder. The first two are well controlled, mostly, and the last one less so, despite Provigil, CPAP, and regular appointments with a sleep psychiatrist. In fact, although I‚Äôm still having real problems with punctuality, I‚Äôve also improved somewhat, thanks to the work with the sleep psychiatrist. 
 
And I‚Äôm on the bubble of being fired. 
 
I had a glowing review last week, my output is great, but the problem I‚Äôm having is tardiness. 
 
My job doesn‚Äôt require me to cover phones, or be available to keep a cash register attended, where punctuality would be a must. I‚Äôve never understood their fascination with punctuality, and the only explanation I‚Äôve gotten is ‚Äúit isn‚Äôt fair to the others‚Äù.

I told my direct supervisor that I could produce medical documentation of these conditions. He said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure that will sway [Boss-Boss]‚Äù. 
 
So my questions are...
 
1.) Are employers allowed to just opt out of the ADA? 
 
2.) I know the Department of Labor considers schedule flexibility a reasonable accommodation. I‚Äôm not looking to drift in at 11:15 and out at 3:50.

Kentucky here.
Firstly, thank all of you so much for what you do for we employees, on behalf of others and myself, you‚Äôve eased my mind considerably.

As it says in the title, I would really prefer to know that everything is locked in before I give my two weeks notice. I‚Äôve been hired by a new company, accepted and signed all the documents, but I need to get the five panel drug screen and background check. I‚Äôm 99% certain I‚Äôll pass the drug screening but without specifics on it, I can‚Äôt take the risk of not having my old job. I have a mortgage, and my parents aren‚Äôt wealthy (social security retired lower middle class, but I love em hahaha). I also happen to really love my old job and my coworkers, and I want to be respectful of both new and old. If anything were to surprise me on the tests, I‚Äôd Definitley want to stay, and I have looked at our documentation and it states that once given the notice cannot be rescinded without extra special approval, and I somehow doubt that trying to leave for another job would qualify. It just seems weird to me to continue working somewhere that you ‚Äúalmost‚Äù quit, Awkward. I‚Äôve researched a bit on the labcorps website, and they say it can take 2-7 days and that if you pass with a negative, you may not hear anything at all. I would need to hear I passed. Otherwise I may have a heart attack that week. I‚Äôm a very talented and productive worker in the design/drafting/art field, and that‚Äôs at least what my employers tell me, but I‚Äôm an extremely anxious bastard. I absolutely know I should just chill out, I would if I could guys, believe me if I got to choose, or could do something to remove my anxiety, I would, I‚Äôm at 37 and have learned to handle it well, but why fellow anxiety folks or those close to them will understand you can never really make the anxiety go away, you just have to embrace it.

My question is twofold; 

Do you fine folks feel that requesting confirmation of the drug test results from my pre employment drug screen is advisable and appropriate? 

How would you phrase the email I would compose to send to HR of the company I‚Äôm planning to move to? 
What would you guys prefer to see that wouldn‚Äôt seem strange or extreme?

That‚Äôs my long version; 

TLDR; 
I am planning to move to a new job, but I need to pass drug screen and I expect to (99%) but I can‚Äôt be sure, so I don‚Äôt want to give two weeks notice at my current job (which I like a lot and want to do right by) until I get confirmation I‚Äôve passed. Is this understandable to ask for confirmation from the lab/HR of the new company and do you have any recommendations as to how to approach that in an email to them?

Thank you so much in advance. Any input helps, and helps me to worry just a little bit less."

Currently at work I've got a four person team. Me, a semi-permenant intern, another QA associate and our manager. Our intern is on a leave of absence currently, so I won't mention them outside of the background as it's not relevant.

My manager and I are both fluent in French, along with our English. His French is much better than his English, so we typically converse in French during our one on one meetings or projects. 

The intern typically uses this an an opportunity to refine her French, as her parents had taught her some and she wanted to refine her knowledge. Again, this typically is when the three of us are working on a project or meeting together (or during our personal time). 

The other associate sits next to our meeting room, and eavesdrops if we speak English - which isn't really an issue for us as we enjoy constructive criticism. 

We switch from French to English, anytime the other associate joins us or even walks in to the room, to make sure that he doesn't feel discriminated against or left out. 

The situation:

Unfortunately, the other associate has undergone some issues regarding a divorce and his stepfather being jailed for some reason. The only reason I know this is because he has been too forthcoming with his personal information. About two weeks ago he came in to the office intoxicated and was taken home and told to take a week off.

Now he's gone and caused more issues by not showing up for work for two days, and yesterday he sent a rather nasty email to all of us about how his wife is a witch, how he thinks is irresponsible for us to speak another language in front of him (keeping in mind the background) and that he probably deserves to be fired.

Today my manager had a meeting with an HR rep, and later we all got another email about how he doesn't deserve to be fired - how he loves his job, and can change to be better.

The quality of his work has declined, notably, as my manager has scolded him for sending reports to the wrong directors and not proofreading them to make sure that there are no typos or spelling errors.

I'm just worried this language thing may come back, and be a larger issue. Does anyone have any advice on how to proceed, from my standpoint, as I have been scheduled for a meeting with HR tomorrow morning.

I think it's important that I can communicate in French with my manager, on our own projects, as it allows us to communicate more efficiently."

Offensive Religious Notes Passed Out,AskHR,82,dbsh5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/dbsh5u/offensive_religious_notes_passed_out/,11,1569960785.0,"Loc: Tennessee

Today at work I found notes spread out around my work area on everyone's keyboard. The note said on the front ""Smile! God Loves You!"" with a large yellow smiley face below the text. Then if you turn it over it has a large bolded ""**But** if you reject His love, given at a great sacrifice at calvary, it would be better for you not to have been born."" it then followed with a bunch of passages from scripture below which didn't bother me nearly as much as that initial statement...

I brought this to the manager on duty and asked who passed it out which we found out it was someone from the night shift. Anyways, she contacted our senior manager to inform them of the incident and then brought me to the back and asked if I was offended by this. I replied that I was actually pretty offended by this, I've got thick skin but when it comes to religion and others forcing their opinions on others, especially something like this.. Yeah, I get pretty offended and want something done about it.

Anyways, shortly after I heard the manager on duty make a call to the person that did this, I missed the initial conversation but it was very short and right before the manager hung up the phone they said ""don't worry, nothing bad is going to happen to you"" and was laughing and giggling about it as apparently they both know each other fairly well. So that really got under my skin, just brushed under the rug. Am I being overly sensitive about this? I don't feel like it was handled properly, and I'm almost tempted to bring it up with my own manager or just bring it straight up to HR. Should I do this? Or should I swallow the feelings and move on to the next day..

Question about toxic culture + team dynamic,AskHR,3,dc5srg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/dc5srg/question_about_toxic_culture_team_dynamic/,14,1570022141.0,"TLDR: a coworker has been tracking me (a salaried employee) and reporting to my boss. How do I stop the toxic culture?

My manager explained that one or more of my coworkers alleged I‚Äôve consistently been coming in an hour late. She did the compliment sandwich thing- saying that I‚Äôm well liked and bring a positive vibe to the team but that this tardiness angers some people/makes it difficult for her to explain as my manager. In the same breath she explained why the rules don‚Äôt apply to two other employees. 

We‚Äôre an 8ish-5ish type place. Some specialized employees on the team do often stay until 7 because they‚Äôve been short staffed, but it‚Äôs always their choice. Others are the pop in at 8:00, leave at 5:00 on the dot type. While I do get in around 8:30 most days, I‚Äôm not consistently an hour late (I‚Äôll alert our admin person if I‚Äôm ever that behind schedule). I‚Äôm a salaried employee, who otherwise gets my work done with high quality.

I admit I‚Äôm not perfect, and will do better to arrive early moving forward but suspect that won‚Äôt really resolve the issue. Plus I‚Äôm feeling unsettled that some unidentified person on my team who isn‚Äôt my manager and doesn‚Äôt keep my calendar/ have context about any time I‚Äôm away at meetings is keeping tabs on me. In fact, she detailed that they shared how I‚Äôll be late, will also take a lunch, and leave on time. It‚Äôs a stretch to even see whether I‚Äôm in my office, so this person is going out of their way.

In the past my boss has asked me to ‚Äúbe her eyes and ears when she isn‚Äôt in the office,‚Äù so if it‚Äôs true, I assume this is behavior she supports. Anyway it reeks of toxic culture to me. I didn‚Äôt react well and got defensive/made excuses in the moment, which I‚Äôm now regretting. Aside from changing my arrival time, how can I best remedy the situation? I don‚Äôt want to perpetuate this bad team dynamic, but we aren‚Äôt a very open/ candid bunch where this could be widely addressed.

I have been through instances of psychological harassment/personal harassment several times and I am as a result very mentally worn down by it. 

This question pertains to a period of about 10months in an internship position under two different supervisors, both of which are to act as mentors. One of these supervisors displayed bullying behaviour throughout - denying that I need a tool to put together a piece of equipment, blaming me for lost items that the bully knows where they are, excessive criticism to the point where someone else complained on my behalf, sexual innuendo jokes, following me for no reason, excessive punishment for cell phone use within reasonable expectations. I am no longer in this position, and am not present there at this time.

I've put together a documentation piece with dates, times and witnesses. I have the option of going through their official procedure through which I would be interviewed again (have already Brough concerns in person), witnesses would be interviewed and I would have to review the respondents responses to each allegation. I do not want to read this document ever again or responses as I find it has given me dehabilitiating anxiety. If I don't go through this official procedure, it seems they are hinting the person cannot be disciplined. Is this true or fair in HR?

However, after driving several hours to take an exam, and then today driving several hours to an interview, come to find out that is not the case. The training was to be in person, and telecommuting was only available after working there for a year. Also, you were expected to meet with clients in their homes and in hospitals. Upon re-reading the job posting, it's clear they heavily implied that the role would be as I thought, but the language was deliberately non commital on the telecommuting. However, the posting never mentions face to face client contact, and that you'd have to travel out to meet clients. Worst of all, I would have to repeat this whole process again if I wanted to apply to roles where I live, because it turns out the exam and interview does not put you into consideration for all similar roles in the state, as the emails I received (falsely) stated. 

I politely told the people interviewing me that I was not interested in the role because the responsibilities were not as I expected. I tried to explain to my interview why I was confused, but they seemed unconcerned. I've attached a link to a screenshot of the relevant section of the posting about the telecommuting, and am curious what you all think of it.

What can I do in the future so I that I avoid these issues? With this position, I did not really have a chance to meaningfully interact with the hiring team until after taking the exam. After taking the exam I was immediately scheduled for an interview the next week. Basically, I had no opportunity to find out my misunderstanding and the true nature of the duties of the job until after wasting time driving back and forth for the exam and driving back for an interview.

I want to first set the tone. My department is comprised of about 7 team members and a director of x department. Recently our senior team member and manager quit (within days of each other). So the director has been in charge of managing all 7 of us and has had to assist in more day to day operations. Well he is a yeller, not just a voice raised but gets red in the face yelling. Think back to when you were a child and your dad was yelling at you things like ""It's like you don't even care"" The first time he yelled at me I cried. I was not used to being yelled at in my adult life nor in a professional setting. The senior team member said it hurt the first time but I will get used to it.

Over a year later I'm not used to being yelled at: I just stare at the wall in my bosses office and wait for it to be over. Everyone gets yelled at, one time I timed it, a guy got yelled at for 20 minutes straight.

Each hallway has a door that is closable. Down one hallway is a set of bathrooms. The bathrooms butt up against my lobby walls, ergo, I hear EVERYTHING in the bathroom...moreso the male bathroom. While I don't have the ability to smell, I can hear very well, and I hear things that are very disgusting. Since the lobby is my area, I started closing the door that led to the bathroom-hallway. To see this door closed is considered not normal, so people ask why the door is shut. As to not embarrass anyone, I say ""to cut down on the noise in the hallway."" My boss (the highest person on the totem pole in this office) made a remark one day, ""Why is the door shut?"" I told him like everyone else. So he proceeds to prop it open. Seeing that I was about to lose my battle, I came out with the REAL reason about how I can hear everything going on in the bathroom and how gross it is. ""Well, do you think anyone else is going to use the bathroom for the rest of the day? I'm getting kinda claustrophobic."" (Mind you, his office is 30+ yards down the hallway at the very end. I'm not sure how someone can be claustrophobic by a closed door down the hallway from them. And two, I don't know people's bathroom schedule.) I've tried playing music over the noises but if I turned it up to the volume that's needed, it would disturb everyone else. I'm not allowed to wear headphones. The closed door does a really great job since it's a fire door and it's thicker. Do I have any recourse? Imagine the scene with Jeff Daniels in Dumb & Dumber. That's how bad it sounds.

"My girlfriend was fired from her job as a retail store manager, over what they now know, was a false accusation. What would you do if you were her in this scenario?",AskHR,5,dbvdrd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/dbvdrd/my_girlfriend_was_fired_from_her_job_as_a_retail/,14,1569974086.0,"NJ - USA

tl;dr at bottom

This whole thing could have been easily avoided had someone simply called her to ask what happened rather than abruptly firing her.

My gf started here job as a retail store manager at a local mall about a month ago. She arrived at work last week where she was handed the phone and her boss said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre fired for editing and approving time stamped schedules. We‚Äôll email you details, contact HR with further questions. Leave your keys and laptop and get out‚Äù. She was unsure what the hell actually happened but she was able to somewhat deduce it and emailed HR screen shots of personal convos between her and her boss about scheduling and other related things. This prompted a phone call with HR, her bosses boss, and her boss (just listening) the next day. 

So it turns out what happened is this; when my gf took the job HER BOSS said not to change the store manager password because it required contacting and bugging IT (super weird I know. I think maybe store managers and assistant store managers share credentials for that computer). Before my gf was hired the employees used the credentials to make and edit their schedules. My gf had NO IDEA that the employees were editing their time stamps with those credentials before or after she became manager. They would come late, check in, leave early, check out, and then later edit it to make it look like they came in/out on time. HR said this happened 5 times in one week with multiple employees. Her district manager or HR thought my gf was the one doing it for them. Her boss **should have known** my gf wouldn‚Äôt have done anything like that because my gf was taking the initiative trying to eliminate redundant and pointless positions from her store to save money so it doesn‚Äôt make sense that she would cover for people in that way.

They didn‚Äôt give my gf all the details but they can see that my GF‚Äôs schedule was never edited but that a couple of her employees were. Furthermore, my gf sent them screen shots of a convo between my gf and her boss asking how to approve the schedule and her boss explaining, saying she did it correctly AND NEVER suggesting that there was some way to see edits, much less saying that edits need to be monitored/checked. In her short time there they made the biggest sales in the stores history and her boss was giving her incredibly positive feedback. These convos were forwarded as well. 

Right now it‚Äôs just radio silence. Is there anything she can/should do to get her job back? If not, what can she do to get some justice? They screwed her over really good and it was pure negligence on either her superiors or HR and shadiness of the employees (not sure who made the call to fire her). If she can‚Äôt get her job back higher ups in the company should be at least made aware of how they are screwing their employees and costing them money. Can‚Äôt she do more than leave a bad review on Glassdoor? What would YOU do in this situation if you were her?

Proud to have filed EEOC complaint against former employer.,AskHR,0,dc4if3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/dc4if3/proud_to_have_filed_eeoc_complaint_against_former/,35,1570014496.0,"I'm located in Texas, and I have filed an EEOC complaint about former employer for discrimination. I'm quite proud of myself for standing up for civil rights and bringing to light discriminatory practices.   


Now that I might be searching for a new employer, I wonder how to present this to the prospective employers. You see, I'm aware that HR hates EEOC - and sees them as a threat to company's business objectives. I've also seen articles written about how to spin bad experiences into good ones during an interview, being careful not to ""bad mouth"". But I also see all these companies jumping over each other's heads with marketing propaganda on how much they care about equality, diversity and inclusion - yet, when it comes to the institution that enforces the principles they claim to support, well - it get's very messy and ugly.   


Frankly I don't want to work for anyone who doesn't support civil rights. Who would!?  


My questions are these:  


1) How do you suggest I tell prospective employer about my EEOC complaint? If I shouldn't, tell me why?  
2) How does your company's culture of inclusion and diversity reconcile with practices pertaining to EEOC?  
3) Hypothetically, what if you were reviewing me to hire and I told you I filed EEOC complaint and then explained why - how would you respond?  


Thank you!"

&#x200B;

After stating that employment is at will and that the employee has the right to terminate employment at any time, my company's termination guideline states that employees are expected to provide a minimum of two weeks' notice of intention to separate from the company.

&#x200B;

I assume that, since the guideline states that employees are ""expected"" to provide two weeks' notice, that this piece really isn't binding and they're just asking for notice as a courtesy. If the contract is at will, there's nothing the company can do if I give them less than two weeks' notice.

Am I understanding this correctly? Any assistance would be appreciated."

Workplace Gossip Problems,AskHR,3,dbuf43,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/dbuf43/workplace_gossip_problems/,1,1569969983.0,"I started a new job weeks ago and an issue I've slightly run in to is that there's 1 female who just has no filter.


She gossips all the time and just puts down people constantly. Despite this, everyone laughs at what she says and she's one of the most popular people in the company. Most recently she got into an argument with a brand new employee who simply was asking a question to the company, and she got offended a new employee would even ask such a question and ripped them apart and is now berating them to every employee. I'm sure that new employee sadly won't last long even if they are a good person. Peer pressure to quit perhaps.


What's worse is that she happens to be one of the people I'm working with constantly. She doesn't know I don't entirely like her and the way she acts, but I'm just hoping not to get in her way or mess up at my own job(which she basically monitors since she's one of the people overseeing me/is someone I'm supposed to ask for help). I fear if I say or do anything she doesn't like, she'll put me in a negative light throughout the company and I'm gonna be forced to hate coming into work, or forced to quit(at a dream job) because nobody would like me.


Any way on how to deal with this? I'm not quitting, because I love being part of this company and it's one where if I succeed, I'm set for life (job wise).


Additionally, others working in our area love talking throughout the day, and they go off on the most uncomfortable topics ever. If HR heard, those people would be in trouble. I don't want to cause any problems, but I also can't afford to just not partake in it because it's a job where we work together at times and help each other out. I don't want to stand out as the weird or quiet person who doesn't get along with people.

US (Tennessee) Ethics Investigation question,AskHR,2,dbvpc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/dbvpc5/us_tennessee_ethics_investigation_question/,1,1569975421.0,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I work at a company that is relatively small but owned by a much larger corporation. My department is very small (consisting of less than 20 employees) and tight-knit. The TL;DR of it is that there is a particular person that has a history of making some underhanded comments about people of different races, sexes, and sexual orientations in the time that I've worked in this department and no one says anything. 

Unfortunately, it has led to a really toxic work environment and, being the millennial that I am, I posted a generic ""ugh my work environment is toxic time to look for another job"" post on my private facebook account. This was posted to friends only (I double checked) and I didn't discuss details with anyone who worked for the company. This was PRIOR to me making a formal complaint to HR.

A few days AFTER I posted that, something else occurred at work that made me finally realize it was time to step up and report this person. I've been in contact with our employee relations team over the past few days and felt nervous but okay about my decision. Our HR department in the past hasn't had the best track record of taking complaints seriously so I was always hesitant to say anything.

But, today, I got called into a short meeting with someone from HR and my manager about my facebook post and how it ""comes across"" or might ""influence people"" during the investigation. I was reminded that I agreed not to discuss the investigation at all once I reported it.

I explained the timeline (it was several days prior) and have no idea who on my friendslist felt the need to say something or why anyone would go scrolling through my timeline from two weeks ago. Is this a normal practice? 

I wasn't directly asked to delete the post, but it was HEAVILY implied that it would be in my best interest to do so, so I said that I would.

I guess my question is in two parts.

1. Is it normal for HR to go digging through my post history through a mutual friend to discover if I had posted anything about being unhappy?

2. Can this negatively impact the integrity of the investigation?

Question About GPA,AskHR,3,dbturf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/dbturf/question_about_gpa/,5,1569967472.0,"Hello!

So, this morning I had a phone interview with a recruiter for a technical writing position. 

I was so excited for this interview, had looked up the company (*huge* IT health provider) to learn value statements/products I'd be excited to work on, had prepped a bunch, you get the idea.

Some background on me: current senior at top 50 university (NC State) studying a relatively hard subject (Supply Chain), had a really rotten string of depression/anxiety in my sophomore year which *tanked* my GPA. However, the past year I definitely improved, and am on my way to making near straight A's this semester. 

In that same timespan, I've started and grown a small copywriting business where I've worked both local and national clients, much to their praise. As of now, I have a pretty high number of happy, easily reached clients both here in my state as well as across the country

To be short - I had a rough patch, but I've worked *so* hard to make up for it, since. 

The interview felt like it was going pretty well, and then she asked me what my GPA was. I was honest with both the number (~2.5) and the circumstances under which that performance transpired. The recruiter simply moved on. When she asked me if I had any questions, I asked my questions about the role/company, but then I asked if the GPA question was a filter.

Her response: ""We typically prefer candidates with a 3.0 or above, but we do take experience into consideration.""

And idk, r/askhr . Something in that just sounds, to me, like ""Yes it's a filter and no you ain't it.""

Even with this worry on my mind, we still closed the interview on a good note and I quickly sent a ""Thank You!"" email. 

My question: Am I right to think the way I am about this question, my answer, and its implications, or am I just worrisome without much reason?

Thanks, y'all!

The interview is based about an hour train ride from home, and they mentioned it is a group interview which will involve me meeting the team and being shown around to see if it‚Äôs a good fit for me. I was told it will run for a few hours, so I would need to take a day off work for that.

I want to know how I can go about taking the day to attend this interview. Should I be upfront and advise I am attending the interview to prepare for employment once this role ends? Or should I use an excuse such as attending a doctors appointment?

I was told by the manager that I was going to be laid off and I was told to surrender anything from the company. I was later told that the ""reason"" for being laid off is because I'm not a good fit.

As there are people who have experienced this reason, I wasn't sure why I was removed. Only reason/s I can think of is from making mistakes in the reports (more substance in writing them for clients doing risk assessment) or sometimes having mistakes due to bad communication with the younger co-workers.

I‚Äôve had trouble with an employee ‚ÄúTed‚Äù who misses meetings without notice, refuses to participate in office-wide L&D events and will miss quarterly review & update meetings without notice. Office-wide events are missed and he refuses to take part in any company-sponsored events, such as charity drives or outreach. When I tried to book a meeting with him about new office policies and procedures, he refused to meet saying simply ‚Äúnot interested‚Äù. I‚Äôve informed his superiors (who are C-level) and they shrug it off. He collects cash by recommending graduate students (MBA) that he teaches to find employment but breaks procedure and uses informal recruitment channels. When he does attend a meeting, it‚Äôs usually 90 minutes late and he always has a phone call and runs out after 5 minutes. He submitted so many expense claims that were filled-out improperly that they hired him a personal assistant, which raised the ire of the rest of the staff.

Ted usually launches all new products himself and is, as he calls it, ‚Äúan ideas man.‚Äù His skill appears to be in planning and plotting new strategies and then building revenue. He‚Äôs always the top of the revenue board, often millions ahead of the next person.

I work for a very successful small business. For fun, I took our employee directory and counted the number of people who are either related or have friends/family that work within the company. That percentage came to 45% and that's only the relationships/friendships I know of.

In our fifty years in business, we've had less than five people of color. I routinely hear stories of how ""different"" the company was as recent as six years ago. These stories are horrifying.

We've had numerous hr complaints over the years but nothing ever comes of them. I even told my Director two weeks ago about a separate racial incident with another two employees with one of them telling me ""not to use their *white* board."" I told my director that our company hasn't had many people of color and that training might be a good idea.

Fast forward to a week later, I told my Director that our IT manager was making some inappropriate comments to coworkers and looking them up and down. Her response was ""yeah, it's hard to find a good IT guy because they are all assholes.""

It's hard to put into words how I feel. These comments have a way of putting you in place, making you feel worthless, and just shitty. Our HR department consisted of our Director's college best friend with a degree in science, and worked in a restaurant before taking the job.

Not only was I being graded poorly in part cuz I went to HR, she was putting in the work record that the entire complaint was false.

Very Long; Read if you want:

**Backstory to the Backstory:**

I am working full-time in a big-city government job. I have been working here for a little over a month. I am determined to keep a full-time government position for as long as possible due to the incredible benefits and opportunities for advancement. The only individual I have any issues with whatsoever is, unfortunately, my immediate supervisor. I'll call her SUPE here for short.We had a local windstorm that knocked out the power on a hot August night. Didn't sleep so I chose to spend my lunch break sleeping on the couch in the employee breakroom. I had a sign that stated I was on lunch, set a timer, etc. A part-time employee (I'll call her PT1) came up and woke me up, saying I might get in trouble for sleeping there and that the higher-ups might think they needed to drug test me if I couldn't stay awake all day. I thought the part about the drug test was hilariously excessive but I did thank her and returned to my office. I mentioned to another part-timer, (PT2) that we shouldn't sleep on the couch. (We warn each other each time we find out a new rule so we can stay out of trouble). I mentioned the part about the drug test as I thought it was hilarious and she, too, found it ridiculous.

**The Backstory**

A day or two later,  PT2 asked SUPE (our mutual supervisor) about the couch rule and mentioned the drug-test fear. SUPE hadn't heard of the rule and said PT1 didn't need to be telling me, a full-timer, what to do. She then started grilling PT2 about me. She PT2 why she thought I was so sleepy that I had to sleep on the couch. PT2 said she wasn't sure. PT2 is an anxious talker and volunteered that perhaps I took something that made me sleepy. SUPE grilled her more, asking if she knew that I was on medication. PT2 admitted that yes, she had seen a pill bottle in my desk. SUPE then asked her which medication I was taking. PT2 stated that it was inappropriate to ask that and said if SUPE wanted to know then SUPE should come ask me. SUPE, not surprisingly, never did.

PT2 came to me the following day and recounted the conversation and apologized profusely for letting the questioning go as far as it did. I reassured her that I wasn't mad and thanked her for telling me about the conversation. This had me extremely worried, however, as I had a suspicious SUPE had been going through my things. When I was moved into my office I told SUPE that I didn't have keys for any of the locks on my desk. She said her desk didn't lock either and that I shouldn't worry about it. I keep my medication in the top drawer because I need to take it daily, and missing a dose by even a few hours can make me loopy. I have a bottle at work and a bottle at home to ensure I always have a dose on hand should I need it. It is not a controlled substance - just a run of the mill antidepressant. I left it in my desk because I wasn't worried about someone stealing it since its not really a ""fun"" drug. Back to my suspicions of SUPE's snooping: she comes into the office around an hour before anyone else. I keep my office door open and unlocked (as I don't have a key for that either) and would come in frequently to the lights being on. SUPE would also look through the paperwork on my desk to ensure I had everything in order. While it was somewhat irritating to be micromanaged like this, she has the right to do so as my boss and I take no issue with that. HOWEVER, it had seemed to me that someone had been snooping around in my drawers as things were scattered. This combined with the conversation she had with PT2 made me concerned enough to take the issue up with SUPE's boss (SUPE-2)

**The Meeting with SUPE-2**

While I knew I had enough to take to HR, I didn't want to directly involve them. I wanted to work things out within the department to show I could be understanding and cooperative as a new employee. When I told SUPE-2 about SUPE's questioning of PT2, SUPE-2 at first said ""Oh no, she can't do that"" but then quickly began walking it back, saying he didn't think SUPE violated any policy and to take it to HR would only result in them calling her and telling her about it. I had not mentioned HR. He used the opportunity to lecture me on the dress code (which I always followed, and which he often didn't) and was generally extremely dismissive. After that disappointing meeting and a few consultations with friends and family in the professional sphere, I decided I ought to go to HR. I figured it also wouldn't hurt since SUPE had a reputation for trying to bully people out who she didn't like, and I knew this would cross a line with her.

**The Meeting with HR**

After recounting the events to HR, they were shocked and said that obviously policy was violated through the questioning. I mentioned my suspicions about the desk but was sure to emphasize that I had no proof whatsoever. I asked that it be kept between me and HR as my main reason for going to HR was to have the issue on record in case SUPE retaliated for my meeting with SUPE-2. They said that the issue was serious enough that they would need to contact SUPE about it. I understood though I knew it wasn't going to be pretty in the coming months.

**The Blowback**

SUPE called me into her office after getting the call from HR. She verbally admitted that she had asked about my medication, but then stopped pressing the issue when she received pushback from PT2. She firmly denied ever looking in my drawers, but said that she had talked with both SUPE-2 and HR and would get me a lock for my desk drawer so that I could keep personal items safe overnight and thru the day.

A few weeks later, no action had been taken on re-keying my desk drawer, but another Part-timer, (PT3) saw SUPE drag another employee over to my office and state that she needed to put in an order to remove the lock from my office door because ""this never needs to be locked."" It was obviously petty and retaliatory, but I didn't care too much since I have never used the lock as I don't even have a key, and only ever close the door when taking a personal call. I chose to ignore it and be the bigger person.

A week after that, today, I got a surprise performance evaluation. The scale was from 1 being the worst to 6 being the best on a number of items. On none of them did I get above a three, and the majority were twos. Ok. I'm new. SUPE doesn't like me. I've made mistakes here and there. Totally fair! I was never one to get concerned about grades anyway. HOWEVER, on the pages where the issues she took with me were detailed, SUPE typed out ""I received a call from personnel about a complaint that \[Shitheadred\] had filed specific to me that was untrue. I asked personnel if I could talk with \[Shitheadred\] about what actually happen (sic) so that they would know what was said and I was told I could. I talked with them and explained what was said and advised that the only time I would inquire about medications is if it was affecting her job performance..."" This is a lie. She admitted that she asked about my medications. Not only is she putting on the record that the complaint was entirely untrue, she has it listed as a grievance that got me poor marks on my Performance Review!!

Finally, the Ask part of my AskHR post: Is this something I should bring to HR? I know SUPE has already escalated things and I don't want to be an ass but I really DO care about this job long-term and don't want my reputation being tarnished as a snitch and liar and poor worker. Also, a retaliatory firing or firing based on poor Performance Reviews is still a huge concern for me. What is the best way to deal with this?

But they‚Äôve become more of a threat at my desk then when I‚Äôve gone hiking or camping. 

In response to employees getting bitten several times and killing multiple mosquitoes in their cubicles daily, we were told to wear longer sleeves and spray ourselves with bug spray. Some of these mosquitoes are able to get through thinner clothing, so I‚Äôve resorted to wearing a thick jacket at my desk. Myself and others have bought several types of sprays, bracelets and even sticky paper fly traps to try and deal with it. After a month of the issue, we finally got an email saying they would spray around the building and asking if any of us had any suggestions to deal with the bugs. As far as I know, they‚Äôve not looked for where they may be breeding and believe they‚Äôre all coming in from outside. 

Recently I had a poor reaction to a bite that swelled to the size of my palm along with a fever and headaches. Fortunately I was fine and was prescribed a steroid cream for the bites. I found out I‚Äôm the third person to see a doctor for this issue on just my floor and one of the other employees had a bite get infected. 

Management is well aware of the issue and in fact I‚Äôve been instructed not to let upper management see some of the sprays (mine are DEET free by the way) and traps I have at my desk to deal with the mosquitoes. Is this an issue that the company should be dealing with?"

I've been told and have also read online that this policy may go against hr laws, but dont really know what to do with that information so figured it wouldn't hurt to ask here.

To be clear, it's not the end of the world for me to take my earrings off before work, I'm moreso annoyed by the discrimination aspect of it and if at the end of the day I'm SOL then so be it, I'll just deal with it.

So, I work for a family as their nanny/personal assistant/house manager. I've been with them for 4 years. We have a contract that is not notarized. I'm salary and my one benefit is health insurance. My contract is yearly and I renew in May 2020.

I've begun noticing that perhaps we don't handle things the same as others do, by the looks of confusion or horror on my friends and family's faces when I say something about my job. So I wanted to come here and ask what's normal and what I should probably renegotiate.

1. I am given 10 PTO days per year. This includes vacation, sick, etc. These PTO days are based on 8 hour days. However, the days I've used them on in the last year, I've been scheduled for less than 5 hours for the day and still expected to use the full PTO day, no cutting it in half. So, I have one day to last me until May 2020, and have lost half of my PTO hours to days I wasn't scheduled to work a full 8 hours.
2. I am a salaried employee, but they go on vacation for two weeks in December every year. I am expected to either:

\- Save my 10 PTO days to cover them being gone

\- Take it unpaid

\- Go with them and spend the holidays (they go from before Christmas to after New Years) with my employers instead of with my own family.

\- Bank hours to cover them being gone by working extra hours through the summer and fall. (This is typically the choice I make)

Can someone explain to me if this is normal to ask of a salaried employee? Shouldn't I get paid weekly either way, as long as the average number of hours I'm supposed to work is met in the year? Or is that wrong?

3. I use my personal car for transportation of the children and there are many activities throughout the week. I do not get paid mileage, I do not get gas reimbursement. The activities are about to increase, and I feel that it's well within my rights to request financial assistance with gas or reimbursing me for mileage at least, since I fill up my tank once a week and 75% of it goes to carting the children around.

4. Is there any legal ramifications of breaking this contract if it was never notarized?

There's a few other things but I'd like to start there and see who can help.

Thanks in advance. :)"

Am I being retaliated against for applying for intermittent FMLA and having a mental health diagnosis?,AskHR,3,dbhq7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/dbhq7c/am_i_being_retaliated_against_for_applying_for/,8,1569904095.0,"**Location:** Connecticut, United States

**Trigger Warning:** Mentions depression and suicide

**Summary:** I was hospitalized for a few days over the summer with a mental health issue. Despite a history of glowing performance reviews, since I've been back my employment conditions have been changed from salaried exempt to hourly non-exempt, the HR director refused to look at my FMLA paperwork and declined my FMLA request, and the work environment has become intolerably hostile with continued unsubstantiated allegations about my time reporting. Am I being retaliated or discriminated against for applying for FMLA and/or having a mental health diagnosis? If so, what recourse do I have?

&#x200B;

I work at a college in a technical, IT position and have a written record of glowing performance reviews and significant merit raises. This summer, I was hospitalized for four days because I was depressed and suicidal. My boss was informed of what was going on, but I did not have access to my phone, his phone number, or a computer while I was in the hospital. As soon as I was released, I contacted my boss to inform him that I was out of the hospital and would be returning to work. He sent a nice email reply, stating I should take as much time as I needed and my well-being was the most important thing to him; nevertheless, I returned to work right away.

When I came back to work, my boss and the HR director met with me and told me to apply for FMLA and chastised me for not providing sufficient notice and updates about the status my hospitalization while I was in the hospital. The justification for applying for FMLA was to cover the time I was in the hospital and subsequent, hour-long bi-weekly therapy appointments. I had a healthcare provider complete the required FMLA documentation and fax it in the next day; there is a fax confirmation proving it was sent and received. The HR director then requested documentation of the time I had taken off so far related to my condition, which I provided. She replied with an unsubstantiated accusation that I was misrepresenting my hours and threatened to change my status from salaried exempt to hourly. (My job has significant management and program oversight responsibilities, if that's relevant.)

With my boss's and the HR director's approval, I took a week of vacation time at the end of the summer. While I was out on vacation, I received a certified letter from the HR director stating that I was being changed to hourly. I was moved from the salaried payroll, which does not have a pay lag, to the hourly payroll, which has a two week pay lag. This caused significant financial difficulties for my family.

When I returned from vacation, the HR director again requested to meet with my boss and me. During this meeting, she reprimanded me for not submitting the required FMLA documentation and said she was declining my FMLA request. I told her my understanding was that it had been faxed in, but I had a hard copy in my office that I could show her immediately. She flat-out refused to view it. (I should have been checking with her to make sure she got the documentation, but assumed she had received it because I hadn't heard anything from her.) 

While on the hourly payroll, I was reprimanded for working over 40 hours per week. I replied that I routinely worked more than 40 hours per week, as this is necessary to perform my job. The HR director again met with my boss and me and informed me that I was not permitted to work more than 40 hours a week, and then accused me of trying to get as much money as I could out of my employer through overtime. Today, I received an unsubstantiated (and untrue) allegation by email CCing my boss that I am misrepresenting the length of my lunch break.

Am I being retaliated or discriminated against for applying for FMLA and/or for having a mental health diagnosis? My job has been changed from salary exempt to hourly non-exempt, there have been numerous false an unsubstantiated allegations made against me, and the work environment has become intolerably hostile since returning from the hospital. In contrast, other salaried employees in my department took significantly more time off than I did this summer and their employment has not changed. I genuinely have tried to make a good-faith effort to do the right thing throughout this saga--first, by going to the hospital instead of the alternative, and, second, by submitting all the required documentation and making a good-faith effort to respond to all of the HR director's questions. I don't wish my employer any ill-will, but I genuinely feel targeted and that my rights are possibly being violated. I'm terrified they are laying the groundwork to fire me by manufacturing a situation where I'm accused of lying about my hours. 

Thank you so much for reading this far. I would appreciate any advice or guidance you might have. **Thank you!!!**"

I am currently working 2 part time jobs and I have an upcoming interview for a full-time position that would basically be a dream job for me. I have been at one of my positions for over 2 years but I just started the other job less then a month ago. My question is would it hurt me to not disclose this position? It's a job I only took to add some extra income.

It is not on my resume and I am worried if I do mention this position, it may hurt my chances. I am looking for some honest input since I had started the job a few weeks ago. I do not want the potential future employer to think I'm a liar or a bad employee for leaving a position after a few weeks or failing to mention it.

I obliged and provided the numbers.  In the negotiation B offered me 25% less than what A has offered. She acknowledged my good educational background but stated that they have a policy of 'pay parity' that's why they are offering less . I am inclined to work at B as I think they have better working environment than A. So I still asked if they could improve the offer. The HR at B concluded the negotiation that she will try to do as much she can do and asked me to share the job offer from A with them over email . As I am a newbie to this entire process, I said ""sure, will do"".

When I discussed these details with my seniors (who are helping me get a job), they advised not to share the job offer with another company as it is against corporate etiquette and it will reflect poorly on me. So I mailed the HR that I am not comfortable sharing the job offer. And if I really have to, I am more comfortable sharing the hard copy of salary breakdown for reference only. It has been 6 hours since then, I am yet to get a reply (standard reply time was less than 2 hours for entire hiring process).

[US] Annual Salary Question / Problem,AskHR,0,dblyxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/dblyxi/us_annual_salary_question_problem/,3,1569922552.0,"A company pays an annual salary - the employment offer states as such. Let's say annual salary is 1 (so we can just work in percentages below). This company pays biweekly. In most years, there is 26 pay periods, in 2020 there will be 27 pay periods (27th paycheck on 12/31/2020).

Let's say someone started working at this company on 12/29/2014. The employee works three days in 2014 (12/29-12/31). Their first paycheck is on 1/9/2015 and they are paid 1/26 of their annual salary (since there is 26 pay periods in 2014).

In 2014, the employee is paid 26 times for 1/26 of annual salary each time. The same thing happens all the way through 2019 where they get paid 26 times each year for 1/26 of the annual salary. In 2020 there will be 27 pay periods, and the company decides to pay out 1/27 of annual salary for each pay period, so at the end of the year employees will have made 100% of their annual salary.

&#x200B;

**Some problems arise:**

The employee in the example above worked 3 days in 2014 they were never paid for. They were paid 100% of their annual salary in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. But they were **paid nothing** for the 3 days worked in 2014 (that is, 0% of their annual salary).

**Another example:**

An employee starts working on 1/1/2020. The first paycheck is on 1/3/2020, where they will get paid for 3 days of work (3/10)\*(1/27). The rest of the year they get 26 more paychecks of 26/27. This employee worked every workday of the year, but only got paid 97% of their annual salary.

&#x200B;

**Is this legal? Should this company continue paying Annual Salary / 26 every two weeks instead of the one time switch to Annual Salary / 27 in 2020? Should they go back and pay employees for days worked that they didn't receive payment for?**"

He is so ashamed that he no longer gives me work.,AskHR,2,dauznl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/dauznl/my_supervisor_allegedly_sexually_harassed_a/,9,1569791836.0,"My supervisor was recently accused of inappropriately touching a junior employee at an after-work event. He was very drunk. 

He is usually very academic and polite, so this behaviour is out of character. However, I believe that the accusations are credible because he has been extremely stressed and likely drank to relax. 

Our firm conducted an investigation and decided not to discipline our boss. However, he remains very anxious and withdrawn. 

While our firm kept the investigation ‚Äòprivate‚Äô, the junior employee told a few people. A handful of people know about this matter- including me and another girl working under his supervision. We have never informed him of our knowledge. 

The problem is that he now treats me differently. My work has always been good, and I had always delegated difficult tasks to me (as opposed to the other girl). However, he is now giving all the work to my colleague. He is even passing over my projects to her. 

Frankly- this makes everything unnecessarily complex as my colleague is simply not familiar with a project. She therefore takes twice as long as it would take me to complete the same task. 

My colleague is very extroverted and favours fitted clothes. On the other hand, people think I am intense, reserved, and academic. It seems to me that he avoids interactions with me as he fears that I may be a harsher judge of his character. This is frankly untrue. I do not care about these allegations and would still perform my duties to a high standard. 

Would you agree with my analysis? And how do I address this situation?"

He's the guy running our facility as well as 3 others. Oversees basically 1000 people more or less. My manager is good, but this director is really, really good - like, this guy is a steal for any company he works for. I'm in a brutal situation (not office politics, just delivering X results while having almost zero margin for error), and I want to ask this guy how he would fix it, because I think he could probably tell me exactly how. Would that reflect poorly on my manager though? I don't want either him or her to take it as me trying to circumvent her authority because that's absolutely not what it is. I also don't want to make it seem like he's coming to me because the people directly above me are clueless (not the case either). I just want his advice, because although she has made suggestions they're just not good enough (they're something, don't me wrong, but not good enough to fix the on-going mini-crisis). She's given me broad latitude to fix the current situation, but I do not know how and cannot afford to experiment because, like I said - the margin for error is zero.

I've spoken with this director a few times and he knows who I am, but I wouldn't go so far as to say I have an actual work relationship with him. When the account I'm assigned to was having an earlier crisis, he came out and told me and another colleague who I was previously working with that we were the two most valuable processors on the floor and that we had put into that sector for that reason (we were brought in during the crisis). He later brought out a high level sales guy connected to the account to meet me with the intention of assuring him that things were now in ""good hands"". This was all maybe 6 months ago, but at the time, I told me I would like to ask him for work advice if he ever had a chance and he told me that his ""door was open"" (and seemed to really mean it). I need to cash that in now, how should I go about it?"

We are both full time hourly workers, he has worked there for 3 years, I have worked there for 2.

Processing information for investigation,AskHR,2,dag216,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/dag216/processing_information_for_investigation/,0,1569706537.0,"Location NY 

I manage a team of around 10 people some remote some local. I was informed on a Monday I'm under investigation for the way I delivered results of a survey and talking negatively about other direct reports. I have never done the latter. 

Our company does an anonymous survey where you can rate the company, leadership, your organization, manager , etc. My results were lumped with a direct report who manages two people. I was give the directive by my boss and bosses boss (as were others in my position) to talk about the results and anything negative needs an action plan. I had an overall favorable rating of 87% with one person who felt otherwise. I did mention it once but centered it around if you'd like to give feedback or discuss more we can here, 1:1 or with HR present. No one said anything but an action out of it was to do psychological safety courses which we've discussed now twice and have more training coming. 

For the negative chatter I've never discussed another direct report with someone else on my team. I have asked for a pulse or feedback on things but that's it. I should also mention there is someone (recruiter in HR) who sits next to me and is very gossipy. She told my direct report something I said about her (3 months ago) which was untrue and I said as much. Two days later HR contacts me. 

I was supposed to have the information at the end of the week but they said they're still ""processing information.""

What does this mean? Should I be looking for another job? There's a lot of back context here I'm leaving out (was hired and told to clean up this region, ie fire 3 people, put one on action plan, hope another one quits and leaves, not my words but my managers). I could see from that perspective why they dont feel ""safe"" but I only fired one person, HR did the other 2 and all for strong reasons (lying on time card, telling people they were going to murder them, etc) but of course I cant share that confidential information with the team. 

I should also mention I haven't felt supported by HR or my direct manager on a difficult reportee (the one they hope quits). And I believe she's one of two who initially went to them. 

I don't disagree that things need improving but we working on that and I've taken several steps to move in that direction but I can only do so much. I'm in middle management and dont make all the decisions. As difficult as this all is I dont want to leave my role or the company but feel railroaded here.

Ex coworker makes threat to shoot up workplace and then gets into building with ease,AskHR,15,da2g74,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/da2g74/ex_coworker_makes_threat_to_shoot_up_workplace/,5,1569628833.0,"A superior coworker in another department than mine was recently let go. There‚Äôs rumors floating around about the circumstances and events afterwards and I need advice on how to approach the situation with HR. Much of this is heresay and I have not personally experienced these events happen so I want to make sure it‚Äôs viable for me to approach HR anyway. this is a throwaway account and I have not included my location because I don‚Äôt want retaliation. We are located in the United States. 

Coworker, we will call him Ian, was reported to HR by another coworker and friend of mine, we will call her Sue, for making a derogatory comment about her around May. He later bragged to his team that he has been reported for sexual harassment around July. This started many rumors and guesses on who reported him. Eventually, my friend Sue was assumed as the culprit and Ian started spreading a false story about what he had said about her (real story doesn‚Äôt even matter, he‚Äôs gross, y‚Äôall get the point. It‚Äôs one of three incidences I have heard about), downplaying the situation. 

Then in August he was let go from the company. He was escorted out by police and his team was told about him being fired and instructed to take the day off. No one seems to know the exact reason he was told for being let go. May or may not be related to Sue‚Äôs report. 

Afterwards, he went to a bar where he drank heavily. He told the bartender about how upset he was and how he would shoot up the company. After this he came back to work in the evening to participate in an after hours, non work related, but happening in the work building, event. Coworkers said he was clearly intoxicated. The next morning the bartender came to my workplace with an officer to report what Ian had said. I did not learn about him saying he would shoot up the place or the bartender reporting him until today. The company has not informed their workers of this, it‚Äôs all through gossip. I learned through a coworker.

Last week he showed up to the workplace, I believe unannounced, and was let in by a coworker and friend of his. He collected his things and chatted with his old team. It‚Äôs been said that once HR found out, they ran to his floor and assessed the situation. 

My concern is how easily he got into the building and how no one knows the real story of the threats and if they are real. I want to talk to HR to let them know my concern and make sure our front desk and honestly, the whole company, knows not to let him into the building. I want to make sure he doesn‚Äôt get in from a friend or old coworker and is able to carry out his plan. More than likely, he was just upset that day and saying stuff he didn‚Äôt mean, but isn‚Äôt it more important we are safe than to offend an ex coworker? Although he has not personally sexually harassed me or threatened me, I feel unsafe at work where this is going on and he can so easily gain access inside. Should I go to HR with my concerns? How should I word it? What if they say it‚Äôs a private matter and are dealing with it? Is there more action my company should be taking? Should they be handling it differently? Should I just sit down and hush?"
FMLA Question - Dr recommendation being ignored,AskHR,4,da7no1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/da7no1/fmla_question_dr_recommendation_being_ignored/,33,1569652416.0,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

Location: USA

It has been recommended to me to take FMLA by two different health care providers. One of which is a mental health counselor. I only had that provider fill out my FMLA paperwork. Their recommendation was to have an extended period of time off each week to allow me to treat not only my mental health and get my stress levels under control, but this extended break is also needed for my chronic health issues. My mental health and chronic illness are related somewhat.

So their recommendation was to use FMLA and step back from my full-time job. I also have an unrelated part time job. I did not want to leave my specific department in a bad place by stepping out completely so I asked if I could just do part time and the doctor said they would support it if that‚Äôs what I wanted. So I filled out and turned in paperwork showing that I needed Monday and Friday off. This would allow 4 days in a row to cut down on stress and my other mental health issues and treat my chronic illness as well which also requires a chunk of time off for treatment.

Now this is my question- my HR department and direct supervisor are giving me hell over this. They do not want to approve this as my supervisor wants to tell me which two days to take off every week that best fits my supervisors and the departments schedule. Against my doctors wishes and my FMLA paperwork stating otherwise. They essentially want me there when they want me there. I have shared my struggles and chronic illness with both HR and my supervisor - neither of them missing a blink in letting me know that they do not want to give me Monday/Friday off as my reduced hours. So me taking two days off a week is fine and going down to part-time, but only if they get to dictate which two days work best for them and not for me or my treatment. They have also emailed me the following policy:

‚ÄúThe FMLA's regulations impose obligations on employees to try and minimize the disruptions intermittent FMLA leave causes on an employer's operations. When the FMLA leave is foreseeable, an employee must consult with the employer and make ""a reasonable effort to schedule the treatment so as not to disrupt unduly the employer's operations."" Employees are also expected to consult with their employers before scheduling medical treatment to work out a treatment schedule that meets both parties' needs.‚Äù

Now me asking to stay and work part time instead of going out full time like was originally recommended to me seems like I am trying my best to not disrupt or make undo burden on them. Also I am not a fan of just ‚Äúcalling out‚Äù during a flare up or otherwise. I want them to be able to count on me to be there Tuesday-Thursday and know that I will be available to get work done those days, while taking the extended break to treat and heal not only my mental health but my chronic illness as well.

It seems like they are only leaving me the option to take leave full-time and not work at all for a solid chunk. My doctor asked me ‚Äôif I was just trying to get by or if I was trying to get better‚Äô. Obviously I am trying to get better and get back to normal as much as I can.

So I guess my question is really, can my employer fight me on this and do this and what options or ground to stand on do I have? I wanted to try and still work part time and be there for my department and not leave them hanging like I would be if I was out full time, but they are really fighting me on this and causing a huge headache while I am in the middle of a flare-up for both my chronic health issue and mental health issue. If you need more information about diagnosis or anything please let me know. Thanks for your help!"

Can I give notice next Tuesday, after signing the offer and tell them that I'll work the rest of the week, go on vacation (being partially available, as a Director) and then give them my last week after? Honestly, this company is so toxic and has taken advantage of me for 5 years to the point where I just want to walk out and never look back. Reporting legal infractions to HR that got swept under the rug is only one part of it.

What are the chances that they'll tell me to just leave versus allowing me to work, take vacation and then work another week before I leave. My new employer would rather I start sooner than later...and this scenario technically gives my current employer an extra week to start their search process."

I‚Äôm not sure if this is the correct or best subreddit for this, but I‚Äôm just looking for some advice.

Background: I work for a company that was just acquired by a much larger company. There are lots of changes going on and morale is not the best. We‚Äôre in a small, quiet office with about 30 people. I manage a team of 5 people.

I have an employee who is awesome at her job and has a great work ethic, but she is extremely sensitive to almost a point of paranoia. She has admitted herself to having ‚Äúthin skin‚Äù.  

I came in the other morning and I could tell there was something wrong. I asked her what was going on and she came in my office to chat. She said she came in that morning and I guess no one said good morning to her or they didn‚Äôt respond when she said good morning. She was wiping tears from her eyes as she told me this. I let her vent about some other things and she seemed to feel better. She said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm hypersensitive today.‚Äù (This is not a targeting incident, our office is oddly quiet and sometimes people just don‚Äôt say good morning)

The issue is that isolated incidents happen with a certain person not saying good morning or her misunderstanding/misinterpreting something someone says and then she will blow them out of proportion. She will act like things are mostly normal, but really she‚Äôll be silently festering and giving the cold shoulder. I‚Äôve told her multiple times that if there are any issues to please let me know and if I don‚Äôt know, I can‚Äôt help fix them.

This morning I was chatting with one of my other employees in my office and she (hypersensitive) came in to grab a poster board she made for a presentation. The other employee was walking out smiling. She (hypersensitive) walks out and walks back in about 10 seconds later looking bothered and  asking if the other employee was laughing at her poster. I told her no and then she went on saying there was an issue going on between the two of them for sometime. 

This has happened a few times before and I‚Äôve talked to both of them separately and together. Both of the times the other employee had no idea that she (hypersensitive) was upset with her and it‚Äôs never been clear what caused her to be upset.

I‚Äôm looking for advice on how approach this issue with her. My last few approaches were to let her vent which has seemed like a temporary fix. I‚Äôm wondering if I should take a more aggressive/direct approach?


TLDR: I‚Äôve grown frustrated with a hypersensitive employee and I‚Äôm looking for the best approach to addressing this issue."

The infrastructure for it isn't at the point I could step away and have it maintain itself, especially in the busiest time of year. I'm only actually at the school one day a week for a few hours, which my current job is comfortable with working around. I work from home one day a week, wake up at 6, work til noon, am at the school til 3, then do two more hours from 3 to 5 to get a reasonable 8 on that day. They emphasize community service being important so they've had the program on the corporate website a few times.

My ideal would be to remain in Philadelphia and commute to an office in NYC two days a week while working from home the rest but I'm unsure how flexible these organizations tend to be. I know that UPenn, my alma mater, is close by as well as other universities that tend to have strong student talent so I would love to function as a sort of liaison but I feel like when jobs are posted they tend to not have the room for changes like that to take place.

I don't know if suggesting something like this would find my resume in the trash. I'm unsure whether I'd take a job knowing it means I'd be unable to help these kids, at least for the next few months while the program grows. I'd really like any stories you have about working out more flexible work experiences or working in a different city than your main office. Thank you."
Interview Scheduling Questions (WI/IL),AskHR,2,da2aie,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/da2aie/interview_scheduling_questions_wiil/,3,1569628130.0,"I was let go from my job about a month ago and have since been on several interviews and received a couple job offers. Being that I am unemployed, I accepted one of those offers and start on October 7th. 

However I had several irons out in the fire and continue to receive requests for interviews. I am attending ones that I am interested in and have turned down lesser offers I've received since.

I just finally received a request for a in-person interview for what I consider to be the best job of all of the ones I have applied for in the last month, and the reqruitee has requested me to come in for a four-hour interview on October 15th. 

How do I let the recruiter know that I cannot interview on October 15th, because I have just started a new job? I would prefer this job over the one I have accepted and hope that I can continue with their interview process, but the timing is dreadful. 

Do I flat-out tell the recruiter that since I'm unemployed I have accepted an offer for employment and will be starting on October 7th, and would need to wrap up all my interviews prior to that date?

I was notified by my job, in writing, that my position was going to be terminated on 9/17/19.  A few days prior I was verbally asked to stay on until 3/17/20.  Since I hadn't found a job yet at that point I said OK, but was not provided any paperwork and signed nothing saying as much.

I have interviewed, and will likely get an offer, with another company (the application process started before I was asked to stay on at my current job).  

What are the possible implications of now giving a 2 week notice and leaving my current job where I was extended?  This is an at will employer.  Again, I never recieved anything in writing.  I'm well aware of the fact that if I leave prior to my new termination date I definitely will not get my severance, which is fine, since the new company has a signing bonus.

Any advice on the situation is much appreciated!

Potential Employer Called Current Supervisor,AskHR,8,d9ugak,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d9ugak/potential_employer_called_current_supervisor/,15,1569582344.0,"Los Angeles, CA

I applied for a job in Los Angeles and went to two interviews that both went really well. Two days after my last interview, they emailed me saying they were trying to get a hold of my current supervisor and were having trouble getting a hold of him. I verified the information with them and they said they would try again. Moments later, I got a text message from one of my co-workers, that I used as a reference, saying they contacted him as well. I got super excited because they were clearly verifying employment and contacting my references assuming they wanted to offer me the position. 

I went into my supervisor‚Äôs office and gave him the heads up that they were trying to get a hold of him. He told me he had a voice message from them and would call them back when he got the chance. 10 minutes later, he closes his office door and I assume he‚Äôs calling them back.  When I returned from lunch, I realized he was gone for the day so I never got the confirmation whether he really did speak with them or not. He never approached me after the call to speak with me about it

I have admin privileges for the phone system we use at work. Now, I know I probably shouldn‚Äôt have done this, but it was eating me alive. I needed to know, so I went through his call log for the day and he did in fact place a call to my potential employer, but then I noticed the call lasted 25 minutes.  

My co-worker said he returned their phone call and they never got back to him. None of my other 3 references were contacted. It was like they had everything they needed to know from that one phone call with my supervisor.

My question is why would that phone call last 25 minutes? That seems very excessive to me.
I am a temp employee and my supervisor has been very supportive with finding a new job. He has also mentioned that if it ever came down to receiving a call for a reference, he would say nothing but good things about me.

Employer is forcing everyone to use PTO at the holidays. Help on how to address this?

So as the title says, we recently received a company wide email (about 450 employees across the eastern/midwest US) that the time between Christmas and New Years the offices will be closed and employees will be asked to use PTO those days.  This is in order to achieve a better ""work life balance"".  This policy starts in 2020.  We typically get Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and New Years Day off as paid holidays.  

This email caused widespread grumbling and complaints.

I happened to be working in our HQ that day and talked to a some supervisors and the CEO about it.  The supervisors were surprised by the email as well and didn't really seem to buy into it.  The CEO however mentioned that most people take that time off anyways and productivity/utilization is very low. (aka the real reason this is happening)

Two things: I'm part of a young professionals group (YPG) at work, and for staff with less than 5 years at the company this is about a third of their yearly PTO (includes sick time).  So these two facts combines causes it to disproportionately affect the younger staff.  

I guess this is fine if you're a traditional christian family who has kids out of school that week.  But what about the rest of us?  The area I'm in has many Muslim families so what are they supposed to do.  I don't really see how this is anything other than a reduction in benefits.

I'd like to create a questionnaire to ask the YPG how they are feeling about this and how it would affect them, their team, etc.  Although most staff is upset, this group already has set 'members'.  Do you have any ideas for questions?  Or is there a better way to go about this?"

I have never had a conflict with a coworker.  I have had numerous discussions where disagreements take place and so I politely make the distinction.  This doesn't work out well because it seems like the interviewer doesn't like being corrected or doesn't feel that the difference is important enough to point out.  I feel like I am being docked for being too specific or pedantic when I simply feel that calling ever discussion with different opinions a ""conflict"" is being over dramatic.

On the other hand if I simply say I never had a conflict, even if its the truth the HR will somehow still dock points because of what they expect to typically happen.  Isn't this odd in itself?  They presume conflicts to happen and if you've avoided it, you are now either a liar or have low self awareness.  Essentially I'm in a lose / lose situation where I'm left with the advice to just lie.  I've asked others and many people simply lie as well.   There has to be something wrong with the process or the question itself if so many people just lie.  If I could offer a suggestion to HR professionals it would be, instead of docking points to people who answer ""not applicable"", offer up a hypothetical instead where a disgreement occurs and have the applicant walkthrough how they would handle the situation if it were to occur."

Unsure about how to proceed with asking for Profile Review,AskHR,3,d9rwpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d9rwpl/unsure_about_how_to_proceed_with_asking_for/,0,1569569361.0,"Located in Ontario, Canada

I'm stuck about a situation at work that I'm not sure how to deal with. My company does the standard practice of giving profile reviews to employees yearly (and before a year that they have more frequent reviews). My year anniversary was last week and I still haven't gotten an email from HR scheduling the meeting. This wouldn't be so concerning, but I'm also unclear about what my standing in the company is.

My performance hasn't been that great and my boss doesn't seem to like me. It feels like he does not have any more work to give me. I finished a big project that's been delayed (due to my part) a few weeks ago and since then he put me on an assignment for something piecemeal but hasn't said what I'd be working on long term. A colleague that was working on the same project with me that was bought in for the purpose of the project was in the same boat but he got a meeting and they told him what he would be transitioning to.

This situation, coupled with the fact that no one from HR has reached to schedule a review meeting has me a little confused. I'm not sure how appropriate it is for me to reach out and ask for what the status of my profile review is. For the 3 profile reviews I've had in the past at the company, they were all scheduled weeks before the actual day of the anniversary. All of this is to say I just want to speak with someone and ask for what my standing with the company is. I've been assuming the worst and have been looking at other opportunities but I really just don't know what is going on. I have underestimated my performance in the past so I might be blowing this all out of proportion but I'm really stuck about what to do.

We‚Äôve been pretty generous to date with giving employees the time off in the request but lately it‚Äôs been getting ridiculous! For example, we just had an employee come in with a note for 2 weeks off for LASIK!

I have been researching this, and truly feel my job duties do not fall under what is considered exempt.

It is also not administrative or artistic.

As they say, the best time to look for a job is when you already have one, and this is what I am currently doing. I'm feeling like it's time to move on from my current employer, but things aren't so terrible that I can't stay for a while longer if the job search doesn't work out.

That said, if I choose to accept a new job, I absolutely cannot take a pay cut. I have been with my current employer for 12 years so my current pay and position are not entry level. I am looking to make either a lateral move in exchange for better benefits, or an upward move to a position that fits my educational and professional background. 

My question is this: most employers do not include the salary/specific benefit information in their job postings. If I am selected for an interview, is it okay for me to ask for the salary/benefit information at that point, or would that be considered inappropriate? I would really rather not schedule the interview, then get all the way there only to learn that the salary is too low or the benefits are not desirable and waste everyone's time.

I manage customer service and have never gone through a company layoff before, so this is all new to me and I'd like to make sure that this is done in the best possible way. I expect this to be tough because we are a pretty tight knit group.

Our HR dept will be delivering the news to the affected employees. We currently have the option to do this all in one fell swoop or to do it a couple at a time over the next 2 weeks. 

I take the stewardship of my employees to heart and have always felt that my job is taking good care of them. My question is which is the more compassionate option?

**Piecemeal option over 2 weeks:** I am concerned that the morale of the department would suffer most from this option because we wouldn't have the opportunity to convey to those that will remain that their jobs are preserved and so they would unnecessarily be worrying when their number is up. I've considered pulling those 11 folks aside to let them know ahead of time. My concern there is that they'll inevitably talk amongst themselves and work out who's staying and who's not. 

**All at once:** It's obviously a blow to lose half your team on one day. Aside from the emotions around this, there would be an immediate increase in the workload for all. While it is a workload that is within the bounds of what they've carried in the past, it has been some time since we've asked this of them. I worry that this in combination with the emotional shock could be burdensome. 

It's a tough time for our industry and I care deeply about my employees, as well as our customers. My director believes that it would be better done piecemeal, but I feel like the bandaid approach would allow everyone to return to a sense of normalcy more quickly than spreading it out. He's open-minded about it so I have some say in the direction this goes. Any advice from those of you that have been in this situation on either end of the stick is very welcomed.

Hi everyone,

I worked a 6-week trial period with a company and was told they wanted to hire me, that I had been recommended for an official position and that the power now rested on HR. Are there any reasons why HR would refuse to issue a job offer? And how long should I wait on them?

New management has been brought in, and it's clear that I'm being pushed out of the company:

\- I'm being given work outside of my job duties that detracts from my day to day responsibilities

\- I've been given a new compensation plan (I'm in sales) that makes no sense and a quota which I have zero chance of hitting

\- The company has pulled resources out of my territory and reassigned them to others

\- My territory and sales bag have both been slashed (I now sell worse products into a worse territory)

\- For technical reasons, some of the products I sell are effectively unsellable in my territory

\- My manager called me the other day to say we need to have ""difficult conversations about performance""

I have kept records of everything - concerns I have raised, documented product failures, refusal to address my concerns, etc.

I figure I'll be put on a PIP either at the end of this month, or at the end of December.

I'm confused about the logic here as it seems worse for both parties. We now lose 2 hours pay (or work extra hours with no OT throughout the week) and the company will still have to pay out those PTO hours eventually. Am I missing something, and is there anything I can do?

Hurtful text message,AskHR,8,d9gay4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d9gay4/hurtful_text_message/,6,1569511677.0,"Hi,

Not really sure how to approach this in the most professional way because I haven't had to deal with this before. I work in a hospital on the evening shift. Basically what happened was it involved 2 day shift techs. Tech 1 was in the department for a few seconds, which I had assumed came back to retrieve something or was on her way out she was also scheduled that day and was still on the schedule and was never updated. Something was left over from the day, and I simply asked her on her way out if they wanted it made or wait until the morning since they might not need it. Anyway she basically just says I have no idea I wasn't here today. Me: ""Oh alright, have a good evening!"". I'm at work so don't check my phone right away but during my dinner break I received a text message from Tech 2 whom also does our scheduling ""I'm not sure what you think I do all day, the only reason tech 1 was in the hospital is because her mom is VERY sick there was not reason to ask her about anything"". 

This literally made my heart drop and almost made me tear up at work during shift. I don't tend to show my emotions, but this was one time I did tear up a bit. This was taken COMPLETELY out of context and I had absolutely no way of knowing what was going on in tech 1's personal life. When she had left she didn't show any problems either. I basically texted Tech 2, ""I'm sorry if it sounded like you left it on purpose, I just wanted to know if it was something that wanted to be done or waited until the morning, also I had no idea her mom was ill"" then I also text tech 1 to apologies and give her family my best wishes. I also mentioned if I said something that was offending please talk to me first 1 on 1 instead of involving other people as well. Tech 1 did not sound like she had an issue about it, she said she had texted Tech 2 to ask about said task and also said ""I can't speak for her, I simply asked her why it was left and she explained perfectly why and I moved on"" 

Anyway I know that was long, but how do I approach this? Tech 2 never replied back to my apology and what bothers me the most about this entire situation is how out of context it was taken, getting involved in something not involving her (it was between me and tech 1), and just being completely rude about that situation and I never even got an apology for that. Is this something I should talk to my department manager about so they know about the situation before there's any retaliation? How do I approach my manager about this issue or what do I say to them? Is this something I just keep to myself? The other problem with this is Tech 2 and the entire day shift tech staff has a big tendency to gossip. This is something she will take out of context quickly turning them against me. Even though this was a literal hey do you know anything about this task, and me not knowing what's going on in anyones personal life. 

Thanks in advance for any advice"

"Is it just me, or have job interviews changed? Now, the expectation is the candidate is there to interview/make a pitch the the employer - the hirer no longer really comes with questions.",AskHR,84,d95wrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d95wrf/is_it_just_me_or_have_job_interviews_changed_now/,23,1569458574.0,"Location: New York State, USA

I'm in my 30s, I'm a data and finance guy (I have a MA in Econ), and I work in banking and insurance.

A year and a half ago, I moved to my current home, from a different state. That move set off a string of job interviews. I ended up taking a job that was a ""good enough for now"" thing, worked it for a year, but kept on interviewing. Just a few months ago, I then took a different job at a different company (better pay, better gig).

So for those of you keeping score at home - I've had two flurries of job interviews for professional, salaried jobs at big private companies, in the last 2 years. During both of those ""flurries,"" I interviewed at half a dozen or so places (mostly local companies, but some jobs I interviewed for were work-from-home jobs for national companies).

I noticed something over the course of doing those interviews - I'm not sure if its just normal for people at my career stage, or if its just something that's just the new normal everywhere - but I was curious if other people had had the same experience. It's this:

*Ten years ago, when I was in my 20s, when I interviewed at places, I was GRILLED. They quizzed me, they had me take computer literacy tests, I would be interviewed by at least 5 or 6 people, I would be asked to give a presentation or prepare something, I was asked GOOD questions and we had a conversation...*

*But in all the interviews I had over the last 2 years - NOTHING. I go there, and no one has read my resume, no one knows my background, no one has ANY questions for me. The expectation seems to have shifted from the hirer wants to ask you questions to figure out if your the person they want to hire, to the expectation of an interview being 100% just they're inviting me in to make a pitch for myself. It's entirely a one way thing.*

And yes, back in my 20s, I did make a ""and here's why I think I'd be good"" pitch during interviews. But that was never the ONLY part of the interview process. Now it seems to be.

Is there some secret hidden genius to this way of interviewing? Because for the job candidate, it just seems like you're lazy, disorganized, or don't really know what you want.

First off, its really hard to explain why I'd be good for the job, because I'm just going off of the job description, and that's typically crap. They're written in vague language, and always seem like the hiring manager just cut and pasted random paragraphs from other job desc he saw on Indeed and hour before it was due. (Or worse - they're written by an HR person who has no clue what the hiring manager's department even does). That's why job interviews should be a TWO SIDED conversation. The job post was enough to get me interested, but you and I need to talk and get on the same page about what the gig entails, and then we can BOTH decide if me taking it makes sense.

Second, if you're not coming in prepared, it becomes REALLY easy for people to game the system and just tell you everything you want to hear and get hired.

Third, its just not a great usage of anyone's time. On the rare occasion I am asked a direct and substantive question during the interview, its ALWAYS something I already talked about on my resume. If you read it before I got here, we'd be skipping all this surface level stuff and getting to an actually useful discussion.

So what about it? Did I just have a string of rotten luck, or have other people been noticing the same thing -- interviews where the interviewer seems to be just winging it, and you're expected to lead the show?"

Kentucky United States. 

This is an odd question, but bear with me. During a potential transition to a new job, I'm concerned with burning the bridge at my old job if I'm unable to pass the required drug screen for the new job if I'm offered it. 

The substance I'm concerned about would be cannabis, and that's the only thing I'm concerned about. 

Of course if I pass it's a non-issue. I'm fully intending to pass, I've already abstained, and plotted out enough time (as far as I can hope/tell) to be clean when I take the test. 

However, although I fully expect to pass, and I'm going to prepare by testing myself on my own at home, I can't be 100% sure I'll pass their test since I can't guarantee parity and similarity with their test and a home kit for certain, since I don't really have any certain knowledge about their specific test(s) 

So with that said, is there any way to mitigate the risk of giving notice at my old job, taking their test and possibly not passing it, and not getting the new job and having already given my notice at my former job? I'd definitely wish to retain my current job if I fail the drug test and am unable to be placed in the new job. However I don't really see any options out of my dilemma, do you?  

I don't suppose there is any way to retract the notice I've given at my current job if I don't pass the new job's drug test is there? Can I take the drug test, then put in my two weeks (which is the minimum) after I know I've passed the drug test for the new job, assuming they're ok with me delaying my start date (They said they would be ok with that, so far that is)? Do I just have to take this leap and hope I pass their test?"

Unsure if I can take intermittent CFRA leave if my employer is pushing back,AskHR,2,d985kv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d985kv/unsure_if_i_can_take_intermittent_cfra_leave_if/,3,1569468170.0,"Hi guys, I'm wondering if you can help me out with knowing what my rights are in terms of determining my schedule for CFRA leave under California law. I've had a baby while employed here before, and my supervisor was very flexible with how I wanted to return to work, which was to return to work 3 days a week at the end of the leave, thus spreading my unpaid CFRA time out over a couple months. This was our ideal financially and to get the most bonding time, so I planned to do it again this time, and didnt expect any roadblocks because the HR rep had been the one encouraging it. But my employer is now saying she may not let me do that (because last time they let her keep the temp replacement on full time while I was part time and she can't necessarily do that now).

From research I've done and what my HR rep has said, it seems like my supervisor can determine whether to let me take intermittent leave like this or not, so I can't do it like last time unless I convince them it's beneficial to them (which I actually believe it is). But, I am supposedly entitled to take 2-week increments and 2 of less than 2 weeks? If that is the case, can I determine when to take those, or can my supervisor deny my request for them? For example, could I come back to work for 2 weeks, then take 2 weeks off, repeatedly over a few months?

This wouldn't be the ideal for anyone involved, but I may want to do it to delay starting daycare. If my supervisor were able to deny that and make me take it as one block of time, I'm sure she would want to. I tried to ask my HR rep, and she both said I can do that and that my supervisor can tell me not to come back to work yet, but that's contradictory...?

I'm also wondering if I can tack on PTO to the end of my leave, but I'm guessing that may also be up to my supervisor to either grant or deny.

Thanks for any help with this.

I got a pre-adverse action letter from them yesterday and it included questions for me to answer like, ""Have you completed all obligations imposed by the courts"", ""What training have you completed since the incident?"", ""How long have you held down the same type of work since the incident?"" and ""Do you have any other convictions than this?"".

Spouses Sharing Insurance at Work - Is this Fair?,AskHR,2,d93f2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d93f2p/spouses_sharing_insurance_at_work_is_this_fair/,7,1569447525.0,"This is Maryland
My spouse recently interviewed to work at the same organization I work for.  During the interview process, he was told that he would need to join my health insurance plan rather than getting his own plan.  At first we thought that sounded reasonable, until we did the math and saw that adding him to my existing plan would increase our costs by thousands of dollars a year, all of it coming out of my paycheck and basically lowering my salary along the way.  Essentially, I would be paying for his insurance and the company would not pay anything towards his plan.  Is this common practice?  It feels discriminatory to me - why should we be treated any differently or denied benefits simply because we are married? Why wouldn‚Äôt they treat him as a regular benefits eligible employee and offer access to his own plan?"

Manager saying *HR* is behind PIP...does this happen and what does it mean? (update post),AskHR,9,d8y5fw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d8y5fw/manager_saying_hr_is_behind_pipdoes_this_happen/,10,1569413373.0,"(Location: USA.)

I posted 3 weeks ago when my husband was told he was going to be put on a PIP, apparently for ""not socializing decisions enough."" Since he had not thought there was any problem before, he began to think his ASD was interfering with his work and he may need the accommodation of clear communication and feedback: [OP](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/czc1nw/husband_getting_put_on_a_pipi_have_questions/)

Update:

* Today (Tuesday) he had his monthly appointment with his psychiatrist, who offered to certify the ASD. He then went to work and was told the PIP meeting has now finally been scheduled for Thursday. Because that's the soonest a HR person can come to husband's small branch office--apparently they don't have one on site.

* And, his manager says it's HR that wanted him put on the PIP, which is why the manager didn't know much about what it was about.

And it seems that this manager is the ""on paper manager"" who he only sees 3 times a year and who only does the time sheet and performance evaluations. In practice he actually works on several projects with different project leads as well as peers.

So it seems that HR told his ""on paper manager"" that there have been several incidents of ""not socializing decisions"" and that's why they want to put him on a PIP.

**Is this a known thing, for HR to be the one behind a PIP? Is that better or worse than if a manager is?**

My reaction is to suspect that someone--one or more leads of some projects, or coworkers on some projects--has complained to HR about this? Does that sound likely?

He thinks it may instead be that HR is trying to establish an on paper reason he can't be eligible for promotion (ETA: he got this from a Reddit comment where someone said that this is what PIPs are for at the commenter's company). Because he thinks that if coworkers wanted to complain about him they would complain to the project manager (the supervisor of the project leads) rather than HR. **Is this something that happens?**

Meanwhile, he has hesitated on starting the ADA interactive process because he fears it would impair his relationship with the people he actually works with. For example, [JAN](https://askjan.org/disabilities/Autism-Spectrum.cfm?csSearch=2456244_1) suggests disability awareness training as an accommodation for ASD. I agree that it would really help if done right--it did with me and with my family--but he's concerned that ""HR coming in all 'sensitivity training'"" would backfire. And I know that (ETA: backfiring) is common.

OTOH, ISTM that whoever it is who's been complaining to HR (if they have been), his relationship with them is *already* impaired.

I continue to feel that HR needs to know there's an actual reason for his social skills issues. He meanwhile never self-identified even for the sake of the company quota (or whatever) because he feared discrimination. Oh and since his small branch office doesn't have an HR person on site, if he does try to discuss this with HR it'll have to be long distance (email or phone).

I'd love to hear any and all thoughts on this situation. Will update on this post after the Thursday meeting.

**Post-Meeting Update:**

I would summarize the PIP document as describing issues in interactions with others, issues that in my understanding of ASD are pretty classic. One bullet point even explicitly included ""not picking up on the hints.""

It does appear to be driven by others not wanting to work with him, which to me is an extremely bad sign.

We're both concerned that the entire document requests that he be more interactive and seek clarity more, and then concludes that the goal is to work independently. It seems to be asking him to do things which might then set him up to be labeled ""not independent enough.""

A smaller concern: One of the incidents most emphasized in the document is something that they portray as poor design but that to the best of my understanding (I trained in this field too) was more just a disagreement on how to approach the task. The document goes on to acknowledge that husband has redone the task--but the project lead hasn't yet looked at the new design! (Of course husband tells me he redesigned the project in the way he was told to.)

I'm concerned because it seems to me that sometimes disagreements happen, and all anyone can do is what he apparently did do: Accept the correction and redo the task the way the project lead wanted. So making this one of the major incidents of the document makes it seem as though they are asking him to read the project lead's mind. I'm unsure what he's being asked to do to avoid such things in the future.

Ultimately my impression is that **he's not absorbing this office's culture and general way of doing things**. Which ISTM is such a classic ASD problem that I really feel like he should start the interactive process. (All he's done so far is self-identify.)

He's concerned that almost anything HR could do would create extra work for project leads, making them dislike him. (But people already don't want to work with him...)

**I feel like he should at least start the process and get some ideas of what could help. Am I off base?**"
"Family restaurant debating firing a pedophile, help? SC/USA",AskHR,17,d8w9op,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d8w9op/family_restaurant_debating_firing_a_pedophile/,5,1569402331.0,"I work in what would be considered a family restaurant. All ages, lots of kid centered events, lots of charity or profit shares for local schools. A really decent place.

There is a guy who works in the kitchen, for convenience sake I will call him Quark. Quark has, since he began, been a bad employee. He ditches work a lot, he can't keep up in the kitchen, generally a very complain-y, kind of dickheadish older guy. He comes off as friendly to employees in other departments because he's always singing, asks how you're doing, but that's about it. He has always had a tendency to ask really weird personal questions, which, if you aren't around him a lot, seem pretty innocuous, but he asks as though he's saving information about everyone, if this makes sense?

Well about a week ago, a waitress was looking to move closer to the area the restaurant is in, and she has little kids and checked the local sex offender registry, and Quark's face was on the page with a laundry list of about 10-12 varying charges of indecent acts involving children under the age of six. 

Now, only a few people in management know right now, and we've been talking about how this makes stuff weird. Like he has invited coworkers with young children to his house, he has been working while we had family centric events going on, and we have a few minors that work in the kitchen part time, and he always compliments peoples family photos on our big wall. It's really bothering other members of the management team because they have brought their kids around and feel uncomfortable with the pictures we have up.

Here's where it gets tricky. A manager I will call Chip (one whose children have visited the workplace and gone to some of the aforementioned events), has been at their wits end with Quark for a while and has been trying to get him fired for a while because uhhh he sucks at his job. But the owners didn't want to, because they loaned Quark money (or gave him some kind of advance, I'll be honest I don't know the details) and he's currently working just to pay it off. I don't know how much, but I know this has been an issue for a few months, so I'm guessing it was a reasonable sum. Chip told the owners to fire Quark, that having him here is creating an unsafe work environment, and that if customers knew Quark was a pedophile it would be bad for business.

I know the owners are in a weird position, having loaned Quark money that they would lose if they let him go. But can they even fire Quark for this? He technically hasn't acted inappropriately in the workplace, but his weird behavior combined with his record is making everyone that does know about him really upset and angry, which I understand. Management is talking about quitting if he doesn't get fired, but I don't know if in this state they could fire him without legal repercussions? I guess I am worried about how this will play out and I don't know enough about SC state laws regarding the workplace. I certainly don't want to work with him, and I don't really know how I could ever be professional around him again.   


I'm sorry this is messy and long, I just am stressing out and we don't have an HR department for me to discuss this with."

Filled out my hireright forms today. Now the waiting game starts. I was reading up on all the bad reviews. So now I dont want my previous 3 employers to miss their calls cause I don't want to get into the endless loop of documents and then explaining those documents to people. I also want to give them a heads up to expect some foreign calls. So my questions

How long did it take for the employment verification people to contact your previous employers?

I don't think anyone would know this but does the call come from a foreign number ?

Thirdly I have a work experience certificate from one of my employers do I upload that somewhere

Finally if they cant make contact on the phone do they email them or something.

Also Is there anywhere in the portal the check which verification have been completed i.e. which previous employers have they spoken to"

I am a director-level employee and report to the president of the company. I rarely get sick enough to call into work, and therefore have around 120 accrued sick hours. The company is reviewing our PTO policy for next year and will be combining sick and vacation time into generic PTO. This is fine because I'll accrue at the same amount for next year. However, they are telling us that Director-level staff and higher will lose (no payout, no rollover) any current sick time that we have accrued. There are currently 4 of us with 100+ hours in the bank. Lower-level employees will be paid out for accrued sick time because there are very few of them with many hours. 

I am wondering if A) if my employer can actually take those hours away since they were offered in my employment offer, and B) can they offer payouts for certain employee levels and not others? We are all salaried employees... why penalize those of us who have more responsibility and rarely call off sick? Doesn't make sense to me.

I gave it a week before following up. He stated they are absolutely still interested, the salary range is still waiting on approval.

Another week goes by, and this time the recruiter reaches out to me thanking me for my patience and letting me know they're still wanting me to join the team. The approvers are receiving ""business pressure"" now so he suspects it won't be much longer.

That was a week ago. I'm not sure if I should cut my losses or continue reaching out, so I thought I'd ask you all what you think may be going on.

To be short, I have a female new hire that made up a story to try to get alone with me. When I expressed uncomfort (there were others there to witness) she has now resorted to be non verbal with me when giving her directives for training. After being non verbal I asked if she was ok. She let me know that she was upset for not wanting to stay and wait with her the time she tried to trick me into being alone. I dismissed it and continued to ensure she is following up with her tasks at work. The next day she attempted to record me with her phone. I advised her not to record me. She (still with the phone in her hand) tells me how do I know she's recording. Another of my staff responded for me seeing how uncomfortable I was. She told me today that I spoke to her with my back turned which I dismissed. She is now requesting a personal meeting with me. She's made comments about my physique, accused me of having a video of her during a recent company event where I was nowhere near her amongst telling the rest of my team how upset she is with me. Her tone is firm with me and I find she is trying to intimidate me because I refuse to be anything other than professional. She has told my staff they don't get paid enough for what they do, and not following directives from her assigned mentor. Thoughts?"

My cell phone met it's end in a sink full of water. I didn't feel any urgency to get it replaced, and frankly I didn't have the money. So I just carried on with my life. (Truth be told it was nice)

I worked in an industrial hygiene office so it was a cubicle, Monday through Friday 7 to 4. 

During the month or so that I didn't have a phone, one of my manager's approached me and told me I needed to get it replaced. Just in case they needed to get in touch with me. I Told him I didn't have the cash for it but my email worked. 

A few days later I was approached again and asked if I got a new phone yet. I gave him the same answer. 

The Following Monday I was called into the conference room to my manager and his boss. I was asked the same about my phone. Gave the same answer. Then I was handed my write up and asked to sign, which I refused. The write-up amounted to be failing to follow directions. 

Told him I wouldn't sign because it wasn't a job requirement. Also said if the company wanted to pay for a cell phone and make it a requirement, I would be more than happy to carry it.

Most of it's caused by my coworker who's quite abusive towards me verbally.  She always reprimands me in an abrasive way that is quite demeaning. Good god the other day I just said hello to her and she ripped into me and told me how lazy and incompetent I was at my job in a reprimanding backlash tone for 15 minutes. She gave me several examples from the prior work shift about how I did it all wrong and was lazy and incompetent. I later asked my supervisor and he said I did the work correctly. She always finds a way to over audit my work and question any thing that looks a bit off. If she can't find any errors she'll scribble in her notes on the stuff that looks slightly off and say how I did it all wrong. I've spent hours crying due to how abusive she is towards me. I've never had an issue with my cashiering skills until I transferred into this store. I change stores every 2-4 years so I don't have to deal with the drama of a long term store and I enjoy the change. Now it's all wrong and nothing's right. Even though I'm doing every thing by the books and the rules are the same as at any other store(s) I've worked at.

Felt humiliated/ singled-out during presentation on Gen Z's,AskHR,12,d7zjzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d7zjzk/felt_humiliated_singledout_during_presentation_on/,4,1569230293.0,"TL,DR: Was the only Gen Z in the room during a presentation which painted GenZ's in a very negative and humiliating light. Felt unable to say anything. Would I have legal ground to stand on if I were to start an HR case with the company? Is age discrimination a thing?

I work as a co-op student (paid intern) at a very large Canadian oil and gas company on an 8 month contract, concluding at the end of December 2019. A speaker from another branch of the company came to our building to give a presentation on an unrelated technical topic (3hrs), and as is typical of the company's culture, started the presentation with a ""safety moment"". The speaker asked the audience of \~50 people if anyone in the room was part of the ""iGeneration"", born 1995-2012, which I was, so I raised my hand and was identified as part of this group, and the only one in the room of 50 some people. I expected her presentation to be on something like pros and cons of growing up in this era, or the cultural differences between different generations, etc, but it was absolutely scathing towards people in this generation. She generalized all of the ""iGen"" as being overly sensitive, stunted in emotional maturity by 3-4 years, depressed, lonely, unmotivated to pursue life goals like getting a car/driving, not dating and ""you know, everything that goes along with dating.."" and more. It wasn't a pros-and-cons type thing, it was pretty scathing, and I felt humiliated at all of this, especially being the only one in the room who was identified as being part of this generation. I felt like she basically called me a depressed virgin man-baby. I didn't want to say anything during or afterward to my co-workers (who are all older, mostly men) because I was already portrayed as being easily offended and overly sensitive, so I just sat there and listened. This whole thing went on for about 15-20 minutes, and nobody said anything contrary afterward. The frustrating part is, this was framed as a safety moment but basically concluded as ""if you work or live with people in this generation, they require special attention because they're underdeveloped emotionally"" and this person made no mention of cited sources or studies, etc. She isn't educated in psychology or sociology, she is a project manager. It just felt like unwarranted advice in the first place that happened to be slanderous. I'm known in my small circle of coworkers as having a sense of humor and being able to take some ribbing and fire back, but the setting being a formal presentation, and her already making me feel bad about being offended by labeling me as easily offended, made me not say anything to my coworkers or otherwise. I felt very marginalized and unable to defend myself during the entire thing.

This happened on Friday afternoon, and I didn't think much of it other than fuming a little until mentioning it to my parents today. They seem to think I should complain to HR or my boss, or the one that hired her to speak (who happens to be a colleague I work with that seems completely enamored with her/attracted to her- so I dont think he would take me or my concerns seriously at all). Not sure what to do, so...probably nothing. Wrote this more to vent and/or gauge if I actually should be offended at all of this. She is a pretty respected and known person within the company. I wouldn't take much satisfaction in writing her an email telling her I was offended, either- I have a feeling it would just fall on deaf ears. Is this worth/eligible for taking to HR? Would I have grounds for actual action to be taken in my favor?"

We have an exempt employee who just came to management saying that he has about 6 weeks of PTO that he‚Äôs banked, due to not being able to take his full weekends or his 1 weekday off (he has a 4-day work week). However, we have a very clear PTO policy. Everyone accrues a flat 80.00 hours per year. That‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs crappy, but that‚Äôs a separate issue. We do not offer comp time or payment in lieu, nor have we ever. We all regularly work 6-7 days/week. He isn‚Äôt the only one. When we need to do work, we do it. I‚Äôve worked for the past 17 days without a day off.

My question: Are we required to pay comp time? Are we required to compensate him in any way? Again, we all work really long hours (when necessary). We‚Äôd all have banked 6-12 weeks if comp time was a thing.

Not that it matters, but we recently paid him a $2,000 bonus because of his execution of a specific project. This bonus was completely off the cuff, not expected in any official way. He makes $85K, and we all receive an annual 10% discretionary bonus, end of year.

Passive aggressive coworker creating hostile work environment,AskHR,4,d7x1ey,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d7x1ey/passive_aggressive_coworker_creating_hostile_work/,3,1569217501.0,"I work for a small oil and gas company in Dallas, Texas. We do not have an official HR department which means a lot of coworker complaints land in the hands of our bosses.  All the bosses are male and we admin/accounting workers are female.  I can normally ignore rude coworkers because they just aren't worth getting involved with.  Unfortunately I have one coworker who has started a smear campaign against me.  And she's doing it in some of the most cleaver ways.

Here is some background:  the coworker who currently hates me is an admin and the company owner's personal assistant.  She helps him with his wife and three kids.  Like sorting out their meds, kids school schedules and clothes for their private school, coordinating repairs for his houses.  When she is in the office she is our receptionist.

Two months ago she had a nervous breakdown and was involuntarily committed for two weeks.  Because she had the breakdown at work it caused quite a big uproar.  We were all worried about her.  Owner told us that she would not be coming back to the office until she could show him that she was stable.  After she was released she spent two weeks just being his PA and nothing else. At the beginning of Sept she came back to the office.  We all said hi to her and welcomed her back.  Hoping that she would be a nicer person.  Well that didn't happen.  First she was supposed to make amends with us admin/accounting people and apologize for her previous actions.  That didn't happen.  She immediately started playing the victim to everything and I was her target.  We all said good morning to her every morning when she was at the front desk.  She would not say it back to us or even look at us.  Last Friday was her breaking point.  We call it the ""sandwich that broke the camel's back.""  On Friday's we order lunch in.  She has not been joining us.  I made the mistake of not asking her if she wanted a sandwich.  Well that was it for her.  Anytime I was in the hallway, she would walk around like a penguin; like waddling around.  I thought she was making fun of my weight since I am a big girl.  She told my coworker it was because we were giggling.  Huh??  Then she has a 30 min meeting with my boss.  I got to hear it all because our walls are little thin.  She told him that I was vindictive bitch.  I've been meddling in her life and I was mean for not asking if she wanted a sandwich.  It really ticked me off but I didn't interrupt the meeting.  I didn't want to be rude.  Then I go out to my car and find that someone has keyed the back.  Oh I was livid!  I contacted building management to see if the cameras were working because I wanted to see if she had done it.  Unfortunately they were pointed in the wrong direction that day.  So while I'm 90% sure it was her, I have no proof.  I filed a police report (without naming her).  Then the next Monday I get to work telling my boss about my car (acting like I don't know who did it).  I email everyone, including her that I am leaving that day at 1 for a certification test.  I end of leaving late because people kept asking me for things.  She comes by around 1:15 and asks if I want a sandwich, I say no (because I'm leaving) and her response is ""of course not"".  She then goes back to her office, and in a loud enough voice, says ""and that's how you ask people if they want lunch, unless you're an asshole. Like that asshole.""  I am shocked speechless. One that she had the gall to say it out loud and second to say it where my mother could hear it.  (she was helping my out that day).  I leave for my test.  The next day I schedule a meeting with my boss and hers.  I tell them everything.  My boss goes to the owner and tell him what has been going on.  Owner goes to her and asks her if she did these things.  She lies and says no.  But then after he tells her there are cameras she cops to the waddling but not the keying.  He send her home and tells her she needs to see her therapist. You see he has been paying for her stay in the hospital and her therapy.  He tells me later that day that she will not be coming back to the office and he will pay to get my car fixed.  She is going to stay on as his PA but will not come back to the office. I believe him. Until Friday, when she comes back to the office. Her being in the office has been giving me terrible anxiety attacks and I don't scare easily.

Is there anything I can do? My boss is allowing me to work from home from now on, which is great but I do have to go into the office every once in a while.  I do not understand why the owner keeps her on. Do I have any right to file against him for creating and letting her create this hostile work environment?  There are other people in the office who walk on eggshells around her.  I just seem to be her main target right now.

I head on to work.  During a quiet time in the morning, I call insurance company.  Seems on ... Aug 20-something (paper with exact dates is here somewhere) my employer sent a letter to insurance company saying cancel my insurance as of Aug 10th.  I'm still having payroll deductions taken out for health insurance.  I contact company HR and they admit it was an error on their part.  It will be fixed within 24 hours (HR representative's words.)  24 hours go and come.  I'm still not showing health insurance on insurance company's site.  Recontact the insurance company, they claim to have heard nothing by this point.  Their system still shows me terminated.  They reach out to my company's HR and a 3 way phone call happens.  HR is finally fixing it!  (This medical is kinda important, I was declared diabetic last November.)

&#x200B;

Last week, I was more looking at my pay history.  We have this nice interface that shows paycheck line by line with net pay, gross pay, deductions, etc with a click the line to get the full pay stub.  I notice my Aug 16, 2019 paycheck had a much larger deduction than normal.  Start calculating the numbers compared to previous checks, and all my deductions were double charged.  (Note, as a 10 month employee I pay higher fees through the year to make up for the summer.  I am not charged benefits cost over the summer.)

I contact HR again, it's after close of business at my location.  Next morning, 9:30 am, response!  It's an error on their end coming from some event they did on 6/21/2019.  HR will get with accounting to fix.  (This had happened previously in 9/2016, and a check was cut and issued the day of, within hours.)

Day rolls on, it's Friday (ever deal with teenagers in a school setting on a Friday?).  I'm checking our payroll website, and bank during the day.  2:30 rolls around and there's no sign of the pay yet being issued or fixed.  This pay has been missing for a month.  I'm not in the business of making interest-free loans to my employer.  I send an email to HR, and management explaining that a previous issue of this nature was fixed day of.  I also state I will be on leave starting Monday until my missing pay is paid to me.  (I have 5+ weeks of leave banked in a hard to use category.)

First HR replies with a they said they were getting with accounting to fix this.  My response is, ""As per my previous email, a previous incident of this nature was fixed the day of.""

15 mins later payroll site shows a check being issued.  HR then emails me apologizing and stating I will have my pay the next day (Saturday.  Yes, I have a Fedex priority overnight envelop with the check in it Saturday.)  \[additional side note, I was not the only employee at my location affected by that.  Another also found said error and was told it'd probably be fixed by not deducting benefits next paycheck by HR.  Yes, I told them to go check their pay stubs.)

&#x200B;

I had not looked at the Aug 16th check as closely previously because I expected it to be smaller.  (I just got classified in the last few days of July as salary with the option to now receive summer pay by having part of my pay banked.  YAY money coming during the summer.  The following paychecks were larger though.  So that prompted looking more closely.  That and been poking at payroll site trying to see if the raise went through or not.)

On HR issues this isn't the first.

1. I've had a manager/district manager-level person think it was okay to delete time off my paysheet as an hourly employee before and had to get that fixed.  (I'd been asked to stay late to let pest control in building AFTER the students were gone.  Had a nice invoice with time stamp of when they left to prove it too.)
2. In 2016, I found out the hard way I'd been miscoded in the benefits system.  As hourly, I'd been told repeatedly, by HR, that I was ineligible for 10 month over 12 pay.  They'd coded by benefits as such that year, and when we came back from summer, I got no first paycheck because it went to pay arrears on the benefits.  Get that straightened out.
3. Double benefit deduction later in 2016.  (Fixed day of.)
4. In the 2017 fall, one of my benefits sends me a letter saying payments had not been made.  Contact HR, forward the letter, get reply saying it's fixed.  Later that school year (January 2018) get another letter from said company saying my policy was cancelled as of... date of the missed payment from letter and returning the premiums paid after that point.  (said premiums were all payroll deduction payments.).
5. Health insurance, see above.
6. Double benefit charge, see above.

Would later this week when the raise request hits a four week mark, reaching out to management to touch base and check status be appropriate?  Their response two weeks ago was that they and the level above had signed off on it.  But it had to be approved by the CFO.  Should I be leveraging the two recent issues into the discussion?

Or should I be packing my bags, putting applications in elsewhere, and finding a way to take that 5 weeks of banked leave?"

I work for a university and when I mentioned that I was using my educational benefits to take a class on war and literature, she initially refused to sign the form because she thought that the texts would trigger me and make me less productive. I later spoke to departmental HR about moving to an empty cubicle. HR agreed, but she told me I was inconveniencing the people who had to move my computer. I asked for cheap mirrors so I could manage my startle response without anyone sneaking up behind me. Again, HR agreed, but my boss told me how inconvenient it was for the facilities people to have to install them. When they did install them, I was out of office dealing with my symptoms and they installed them in the wrong place. When I mentioned that I needed to have the mirror moved, she asked if it was absolutely necessary for me to ‚Äúget it in the perfect position‚Äù because the facilities people were going to be ‚Äúso annoyed‚Äù and I said, ‚ÄúYes, because it‚Äôs completely ineffective otherwise‚Äù Then I added, ‚ÄúAnd if the paperwork goes through, my doctors have both mentioned the desk configuration issues, so someone is likely going to have to take care of this eventually whether it‚Äôs inconvenient or not‚Äù I was tired of hearing about all the extra work my medical condition was going to be causing her, given the fact that I am simply trying to get my job done as inexpensively and painlessly as possible.

My boss then told me that she was only obligated to discuss reasonable accommodations, not provide them, which I didn‚Äôt think was accurate, unless there‚Äôs undue hardship or something. She also reminded me that my office doesn‚Äôt have to do anything for me until the paperwork comes through and I am well aware of that and did not phrase it as such, but every other person in my office has asked for ergonomic chairs, stand-up keyboards, light therapy lamps, more expensive computers. Meanwhile, I have never asked for so much as a calendar and I am getting pushback on very basic and vital requests.

I'm the manager of a retail store for a small chain (Approx 10 stores).Our Head Office has recently paid to have an app called TimeStation, which provides each employee with a GPS-Tagged QR code to scan when arriving and leaving the store, to clock in and clock out.  
My phone, which I've had for a few years, and had well before working for this company, is fairly outdated and the GPS function doesn't really work anymore, and have never been able to use this app.   


Head Office was very unhappy that I wasn't using this application, which my phone didn't really support, and would constantly tell me that they would ""have to look at disciplinary action"" if I didn't start using it.  
I don't think I should have to buy a new phone just to use an app my company started using AFTER I signed my contract, which didn't state that I needed a smart phone. After a few months of my company pressuring me, I reasoned that it was probably time to upgrade anyway and purchased a newer phone.

I installed the app, and went to clock in, but the app is still stating that it's unable to find my GPS location, and thus won't clock me in.   
I googled the app, and found a few other negative reviews with the same fault, people unable to use it due to GPS Location finding errors; and I showed these to my bosses. They've told me that it doesn't matter, because other staff in other stores are able to use the app without fault, and that if I don't begin to use the app daily, that ""they may have to look at consequences""

My mind is spinning so I will keep this short and factual. I work in VT for a company of 20 people. I‚Äôve been a full time employee for 3 years. I was promoted to a manager position 7 months ago. There is a document outlining my job description/duties. 2 months ago I was diagnosed with cancer and I went on approved medical leave. This morning I learned that when I return to work I will not have the same job title or description. Two people covered/are covering my duties while I was/am out, but it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúcritical‚Äù position and no one has ‚Äúbeen hired‚Äù to replace me. I have only had one performance review with HR and it was all positive. HR at my company doesn‚Äôt exactly exist, as the one HR person is very close with the CEO and completely intertwined with management. 

My questions are:

1. Do I qualify for FMLA? According to the VT DHS I am 99% sure I do. 

2. How can I ask my employer to confirm I was eligible for FMLA when I began my leave 8 weeks ago? Can FMLA retroactively apply, and can I ‚Äúenforce‚Äù this against my employer?

3. Can I be demoted upon my return to work? My job upon return will not be the same or equivalent position. 

4. Am I effectively being fired if I am being forced out of my current position, regardless of FMLA?

I got written up because my wife talked to HR,AskHR,110,d6onb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d6onb9/i_got_written_up_because_my_wife_talked_to_hr/,32,1568976624.0,"(Virginia)

I work at a school. We were notified last Tuesday of our new benefits package, which is absolute crap for various reasons. We switched to a different insurance company, the premium for families went up significantly from last year, a spousal carve-out was added (if your spouse works somewhere else and is offered health insurance, then you are not permitted to claim them on your insurance,) and our life insurance was reduced from 3 times the salary to twice the salary after we had already signed contracts for the year. We were told that we had until COB Friday to submit the insurance forms. Many employees complained that, with such significant changes to the coverage, we needed more time to research and make a decision. They extended the deadline to the following Tuesday at noon.

On that Tuesday, while my wife was at home working on finishing the paperwork and I was in class teaching, she found that she did not know our kids' SSNs off the top of her head and could not locate them. She emailed HR and explained the situation, stating that she was confident she would be able to find them by the end of the day. HR said to go ahead and bring the forms in and that they would fill in the SSNs that they had on file. I left class during a break, came home and got the forms, and turned them in. The HR manager thanked me and put sticky notes on them reminding her to add the SSNs before submitting.

Sometime that afternoon, the new CFO, who has been here about a month, grabbed those forms off of the desk of the HR manager, before she was able to add the numbers. He sent me an email telling me that the numbers were missing, that they were required, and that the matter required my immediate attention. I replied and asked whether the HR manager had not been able to receive them, and was told that it was my responsibility to complete the forms and that I needed to come see him when I had a chance.

At the time, I was home with a baby while my wife was picking up our other child at school. I looked through the house frantically to find the SS cards for the kids while trying to keep the baby happy and was able to find one, but not the other. My wife got home just before I needed to leave to coach an athletic practice and took over. She found the other card rather quickly and headed to the HR office to update the forms before they were submitted. This is around 4PM, pretty close to COB.

When she arrived at the office, with both children, she was met by the CFO with a cold reception. He told her that protocol dictated that the employee, not the employee's spouse, submit the forms. She was a little taken aback, asked for clarification, and got another cold response. She told him that she was uncomfortable with how he was talking to her. His reply was, ""Then you can leave and send your husband in to talk to me."" He turned and walked away without waiting for a response.

At this point my wife was flabbergasted. She stood there with her mouth open, holding the baby while the other kid stood next to her, and asked aloud, ""Did anyone just see that?"" The HR manager tried to comfort her, led her to a chair where she could sit down, and went to proceed with entering the social security numbers on the form. The CFO returned in the midst of this and said, ""I specifically told you that we need your husband here, not you."" My wife was actually crying at this point, and the HR manager kind of shooed him away while she entered the numbers.

My wife left that situation, found me at practice while I was coaching, and just walked up to me and started crying without saying a word. It took me a while to get the full story out of her. When I got home around 5PM, I got a phone call from a number that I did not recognize, and for some reason, I answered it. Very out of character. Anyway, it was the CFO calling me at home after hours on my personal cell phone to tell me that he needed to see me at school.

I went in the school where the CFO was waiting with some other new employee in that department whom I have never met. He sat me down in an empty office and opened with, ""I assume you know the topic of this meeting."" I told him I had an idea. He asked if I had attended the required benefits meeting, which I had. He then told me that I should have known the policy. He proceeded to tell me that, no matter how the academic dean or athletic director wants me to do things, the way things are done in the HR department is his way, and his way is to deal with employees, not the spouses of employees. It did not go that way, and ""it did not go swimmingly. It got <the HR manager> in trouble."" I said, ""I'm sorry that happened."" He went on to tell me that I was having a written warning placed in my personnel file and asked if I had anything to say.

My reply was that I had previously given permission for HR and my wife to speak about such matters, because I have a full time job with specific time constraints and she does not, she is covered on the policy, our children are covered on the policy, they are her children as much as mine, and she has been speaking to HR concerning those matters for years before, and I was not aware that the permission had been rescinded. The CFO told me that it had been rescinded indeed, that was put out and must not have been communicated to me, and that my wife is no longer to communicate with HR.

I, of course, left that meeting and told nearly every employee I ever talk to about what happened. Not one of them gave any indication that they knew that spouses were not allowed to talk to HR, and the general consensus was that it seemed a pretty absurd policy.

By the way, I received an email from HR this morning telling me that since I was not present when the social security numbers were written on the form, they needed to be filled out again in their entirety and resubmitted. I again left class during a break, filled out the form, and submitted it.

I ask you:

1. How normal is it for a business to have a policy that the spouse of an employee is forbidden from talking to HR about health insurance coverage when they are on the insurance policy? 

2. Is there any recourse I can take regarding having a written warning placed in my personnel file for violating a rule that was apparently never published or communicated to me or anyone else on the staff?

3. Is there any recourse I can take regarding the incredibly rude manner in which the CFO spoke to my wife when she was in the HR office with our children while I was working?

Thanks for reading!

UPDATE:
We reported the entire incident to the CFO's supervisor, whose title is something like Director of Internal Affairs. He all but refused to respond to any emails, insisting on meeting in person to discuss it. I can only assume he wanted to avoid a paper trail. I challenged his assertion that the issue had been addressed with all parties concerned. I acknowledged that there may be some good reason not to allow spouses to talk to HR, but the way that it was handled was over the line, and my wife deserved a written apology. No observable action was taken, no apology was issued, and someone in the administrative area appears to have attempted to start a rumor that it was actually my wife who was the one to go into HR yelling and making a scene. It was revealed that the CFO, who began in that position August 1, has been a close personal friend of the president of the school for years, and no disciplinary action is likely for him. Meanwhile, I had begun sending out resumes and applying for jobs the night I got home after it happened, and I resigned as soon as I got an offer. After 12 years here, we are moving on with our lives."

There are only a couple of other places in the city with  relevant positions that I could go to work at without violating the non-compete, otherwise I'd have to go into a completely different industry of work (I'm not qualified or really experienced in anything else). These other places also very rarely are hiring for positions relevant to me.

My current employer has me working well above my pay grade. They know it, everyone knows it, but I'm a hard worker so I just accept it. A couple of years ago I did apply elsewhere though, when the company was going through a period of not doing great. At the interview I was basically told there and then that they loved me and I'd be getting the job. I made it \*very\* clear that they shouldn't contact my current employer. When I never heard back from them I called the department I interviewed with (which they'd asked me to do if I didn't hear back, because they \*really\* wanted me there) but they hung up on me, then ignored the couple of calls I  made to them over the next couple of weeks. I figured (with it being such a niche industry) that someone there probably knew someone at my current job and something might have been said to scare them away, perhaps something about the non-compete, despite this job not actually being in violation of it.

A couple of weeks ago I found out I wasn't far off. For whatever reason, the place I applied to called my current employer anyway and my boss answered. I don't know what he said to them, but he said enough for them to never call me back and for them to ignore my calls. My boss \*really\* doesn't want me to leave, 1) because I do so much work and keep the place running and 2) because I do it for substantially less then other employees there make. I'm basically their golden girl, and the boss even refers to me as that in meetings with the CEO. My boss did, however, give me a pay raise just after he apparently got that call in the hopes it would stop me job hunting. The raise was $1, and the job at the other place would have had me starting at $4 more than I'm making after this raise, with a job title that is actually accurate and not below my pay grade.

Should I just put this down to bad luck and deal with it? Should I approach my boss about it and demand a pay raise?  Something else?

Writing up a disabed employee,AskHR,5,d6yjk9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d6yjk9/writing_up_a_disabed_employee/,2,1569030736.0,"Original post  [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/ax8f8s/need\_to\_fire\_a\_disabled\_employee\_am\_i\_doing\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/ax8f8s/need_to_fire_a_disabled_employee_am_i_doing_the/)

ILLINOIS 

So updating from my first post, the employee who killed the birds improved greatly. I'm still not 100% happy with her manipulation that occurs but it's gotten a lot better, and she has actually helped with a lot of work around the dept.

My new problem is the other employee. 12 year emp. has a hearing disability. Over the past year she has not understood things told to her, so I do a lot in writing and email, which she refused to read everyday as I asked.  She is rude, manipulative and resistant to direction.

I have documentation from a consultant, another manager and another line worker that she is rude when speaking to them. She's actually gotten into fights with the other manager. (She was to provide cookies for a meeting at 3 pm, had cookies ready at 2:57 but got yelled at by the employee because she wasn't ready for them. When the employee picked them up after 3, she blamed the manager for being late)

I wrote her up for being rude to customers and staff once before, and she yelled at me, refused to sign and said I need to accommodate her disability. Didn't know begin rude was a disability, I TRIED to explain it to her but she walked out. HR Director signed as a witness afterwards.

I wrote her up again the other day but this time gave her the write up in front of my boss, who backed me up. We explained she is to listen to what I say and watch how people perceive her reactions.  She agreed and signed the write up.  She tried to blame me for the write up, saying I had the wrong thing on a paper, which I did, but it was not the reason for the write up.  I asked her to do something different, and she was originally told of the change, and she got mean in front of customers and myself. This has been going on for a few months now, if I tell her to change something, she gives me an attitude and talks back.  She 100% denied getting angry.

It's getting to the point where I asked the other managers to write a statement of when she was rude to them. I have them in her file. She is now going around to other employees saying I wrote her up for the wrong thing on the paper, so did she not understand? Did she not hear in the meeting she was written up for being rude? I mean it's getting to the point where I cannot be alone with her because I need a witness. She's also  VERY manipulative, and only brings up her disability when it will 'help' her.  Otherwise, she has never requested any sort of accommodation.

She cannot do the job. I am currently running 3 departments and need people to be able to do the job. I have tried to train her and she signs off, but never asks me questions if she has a problem. She cannot click on icons on a computer, and I made the screen bigger for her. She still, cannot do the PC work.

I know my boss is afraid of ADA. His boss spoke with me and said she would help move her on because of the attitude problem, but everything needs to be documented.  I also got word that she is planning on taking the paper into my boss to prove that it was my fault today.  He is aware of what the paper says. I'm off on a vacation day today but have to deal with this bs from her still. Is there any other documentation or anything else I can do about this to CMA?"

Now I'm on the job hunt for an RN position and I still have her number saved. Although it's a different position, I was thinking about giving her a call. I did mention I would be graduating in 3 months when I spoke to her last. I forgot the specifics of our conversation, but Idid save her contact info in my phone so wanted to know if it would be appropriate to call and ask about RN positions even though she did not contact me about them."

Everyone seemingly gets along great and we often have happy hours and I enjoy most of the office banter. However, I am the only black person or POC in the office and at times I think people forget that I am here and they let comments slip. Comments that I imagine if said in the presence of only white people would go relatively unnoticed or be recognized as offensive. I usually just ignore and reach out to one of my close friends in the office to complain about briefly and he assures me they mean no harm and they are just uncultured.

Well today I feel as if I am reaching a breaking point. A coworker who is not only on my team, but is considered higher up than me made some nasty comments. When talking about bus routes I described some funny incidents that have happened on my way in. My coworker (let's call him Andrew) followed up with my story ""stuff that like never happens on my route, everyone on my bus comes from X area and everyone there looks like me"".. WUT? Another coworker jumped in to presumably change the direction of the conversation by stating ""IDK, people from X area can be pretty shady too"" to which Andrew responded ""Cmon, do you cross the street when you see someone like me coming?""... I was so baffled by this conversation that I just announced I needed to get back to my desk.

I do not want to create a scene with HR about it but I am getting tired of these remarks. I also love my job and do not want to leave. Does anyone have any tips for dealing with these sort of interactions in the workplace?

&#x200B;

Edit:  Thank you all for the helpful responses!  A few things I would like to add as background.  Several months ago I did report an incidence of sexual harassment to our HR team and it was handled very poorly (the person I reported got promoted two days after and was only told not to text me anymore).  It was very awkward afterwards.  I had meetings with three people then two more people were informed and briefed on the situation.  That's almost half my office!!.  Because of what happened in this situation, I don't think I'd want to report anything again which is awful but still.

I did ask my friend who was in the room to message Andrew and tell him ""dude, you need to watch what you say..""  My hope is that if this comes from another white coworker Andrew will take it more seriously and rethink his actions.  I went about it this way to avoid a direct confrontation.  

On a fun note Andrew now gets an occasional blast of air from the nerf gun I keep at my desk so I am keeping him on his toes."

I work in HR for an education company in China. The company employs many non-Chinese citizens to act as teachers for Chinese children. Like many companies in the education industry in China, racism against black people (and similar discrimination based on age and appearance) is very common. It is not unusual for us to provide a candidate to a campus leader, for that person to tell us ""no thanks, the parents at our campus want a white teacher, so we won't hire this black teacher.""

I'd like to find some sort of a simulation or analysis to demonstrate that ignoring a certain group of people for reasons unrelated to their talent ends up reducing the level of talent overall in the organization. For example, if I discriminate against short accountants and only hire tall accountants, then I am missing out on a significant subset of talent. If I only hire basketball players whose name start in the first half of the alphabet, then my team will (on average) perform worse than a team that hires players without consideration of first name. If I refuse to hire gay translators, then the quality of my translation will overall be worse than it otherwise would be, because I am hiring from a smaller talent pool.

Has anyone encountered something like this before? Can anyone point me in the right direction?"
Director shamed me for a FB post when she doesn't have access to my page,AskHR,4,d6n1dz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d6n1dz/director_shamed_me_for_a_fb_post_when_she_doesnt/,15,1568968541.0,"I live in Florida and work for the state.

I have been in the process of seeking a position reclassification and salary increase for about 4 months. Our new director (who barely knows me) reached out to me on Monday with the ""great news"" that I had received a reclass and pay increase. Both of these were different than what was requested by my supervisor on my behalf. I expressed confusion and asked if this could be looked at again but was told it was highly unlikely anything would change. It was very evident that this person was not pleased that I was asking her to return to HR to provide me some clarification and to get this figured out. 

That night, I found an article about women and asking for raises and I shared it on my private Facebook page. In the post I said I had asked for a raise and been told no. I did not mention my employer or position. 

Unfortunately, I am FB friends with one person in my department (of about 50). We see each other on maybe a monthly basis and are not IRL friends. Imagine my surprise when the next day, the director sends me an email (copying my supervisor, the assistant director, and a person in HR) saying that no, there will be no further changes and I can accept this reclass and salary, or walk. She then finishes the email by saying ""I am saddened that you took to Facebook, a public forum, to express your discontent with the situation instead of taking a professional approach and speaking to the appropriate individuals involved.""

UMMMMM. I know this person doesn't have access to my private Facebook page so I believe my FB ""friend"" brought this post to the director's attention. I responded to the email immediately asking to sit down and discuss what she was accusing me of but of course I haven't heard anything in over 48 hours. She was also unavailable for me just to walk into her office. But I honestly don't even know what to say. The fact that she accused me about something on my private Facebook page is unbelievable but I don't know how to address it in a respectful way. When I'm mad, I cry and I really want to try to avoid that too.

My company doesn't have a policy on posting things on private social media, so while I don't think this is something she could try to get me in trouble for, I am livid that she copied these people on this email making my action sound far more sinister than it was about something she had no right to see. I love my job and have an exemplary record there, but I really feel like she needs to send an apology out to everyone because of the way this makes me look. I know she won't but I'm also afraid she will use this to retaliate against me in the future. What should I do?"

Type of work: Law Enforcement/Higher Education

I just found out that I'm probably (90% certain) going to be fired from my part-time position within a college police department tomorrow morning. The reason will be improper conduct/sexual harassment. 

I was hired into a supervisory position earlier this year (despite not having any supervisory experience) that oversees up to 10 student workers for the department. One student felt they were being sexually harrased by at least two other students due to the nature of conversations and comments and gestures made while the 3 worked the same shift. I in particular am being blamed for 1) participating in some of these conversations  2) not doing enough to shut down these conversations when the first student stated they were uncomfortable/distressed, and 3) in essence condoning and encouraging these conversations and comments through my lack of action.

I'm not here to argue that I don't deserve to be fired; I absolutely deserve to be shit-canned with prejudice. I completely failed in my basic duties as a supervisor and I am taking complete ownership of my actions and lack thereof. I am also aware that I will not be eligible for unemployment due to the reason I am being terminated.

What I want to know is this: how will this affect my ability to apply for, and be hired for, any other positions in other departments at this particular college, and ramifications for applying to and getting hired into any position in any other college in this state or other states? 

Also, since this will be going in my permanent employee record and will come up in background checks, how do I address this issue when I attempt to apply/interview for other jobs in the future?"

I recently asked a question and a helpful member with an HR perspective was able to provide a little perspective but had not encountered this situation so wasn't sure.  Is there still a typical process for an employee that was laid off due to redundancy (5-6 months ago) and where the position was now re-posted? (The position is virtually identical in function but time of the employee's service was less than a year in a compliance/service/legal/HR like role and these seem to be the most vulnerable positions at the company).

I don't believe there is a company policy against re-hires as this has apparently happened with employees in the past but I don't know the context there.

Other potentially relevant context is that the direct hiring manager and another relevant senior colleague previously has seemed supportive and in hindsight a more senior than either but indirect manager perhaps less so.  

I'm mostly trying to get a sense of what to expect (if there was a closer relationship with the previous hiring manager that might be an inside perspective but I'm also not sure if there are policies typically in place barring information or like any ""inside communication"" in this scenario because it has them in place for providing references) or whether it just makes most sense to just move on.

Questions:

1. If you have seen this before, what was the process?  Was it expedited or were there policies around keeping a posting up and engaging a new applicant pool for fairness/equitable reasons etc?  Was HR involved or was it mostly management/hiring managers driving things forward? (If relevant the HR at the company is mostly outsourced and initial turnaround for position was about 6 weeks from application to first HR contact and then 2 weeks for interviews and offer process).
2. Are there policies against how a former employee laid off is or can be re-engaged?  I think I understand there are continuity of service aspects etc. but I would assume 6 months might pass the threshold and the employee and position might just be approached as a new thing?
3. Any general thoughts or potential considerations are also welcome."

Is HR ghosting me after 3 interviews ?,AskHR,4,d6fdgi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d6fdgi/is_hr_ghosting_me_after_3_interviews/,16,1568934511.0,"Big corporate, with a whole HR dept. I went through a first phone screen with HR, then a 3-hour tech interview on-site with 2 hiring managers, then a final one-hour on-site HR interview. There was definitely some hiccups during this last HR interview, but I was told by the HR rep at the end of the interview that they have a last candidate to interview the same week, and that I would get an answer (either by phone or by mail) by beginning of next week (so this very week) no matter the outcome. I'm still waiting. They were pretty fast to react in between the phone screen and first interview, and between first interview and last one (couple of days each time).

To be honest, I'm not expecting a positive answer, but I would at least want an honest feedback. But if they are just being rude and ghosting me, I would prefer not to talk to them ever again.

My insurance stipend has been taken away and I don't know how to address this decrease in pay!,AskHR,2,d6ifyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d6ifyz/my_insurance_stipend_has_been_taken_away_and_i/,3,1568947763.0,"This is kind of a long and complicated story so hold tight! I'd really love any advice on this. I'm not sure how to approach the problem!

I have been at my job for a year and a half. 6 months ago, I got my 1-year review and a raise from $21 an hour to $23. I asked my boss to consider raising my hourly to $25, because when I did my research, that was the average compensation for someone doing my job, with my level of experience (masters degree, 4 years of communications/ marketing experience). 

The following day she came back to me and said she would not give me the additional raise because my annual take-home pay was more than what $25/ hour would make, ***once*** she added up my annual bonus, paid holidays, PTO, overtime, **AND $500 monthly insurance stipend (this is important later).**

So fast forward to today, she notifies me that I will no longer be getting an insurance stipend, and instead, I will be added to a new group insurance plan that the company just bought, so now my insurance will be free and I will not receive the stipend. 

Here is the thing, my insurance only cost $200 a month and my boss explicitly said that she was ok with me keeping the extra money left over, as the stipend was a benefit outlined in the contract I signed when I joined the company. With this group policy, I will not receive the stipend and so my income (which supports my fiance and I) has been cut by $3,600 per year. 

To me, this is a BIG deal. Our finances are really carefully measured because I am supporting us both. Should I ask for some type of compensation to make up for the money I am losing without the stipend? This was one of the reasons my boss didn't give me the raise but now I'm not making as much as I would have if she would have given me the raise I had asked for. 

I have no idea what to do and I don't know how to approach this. Her and I are the only staff and there is no HR so I have no idea if my feelings are even valid! I'm scared to bring it up to her. Any help is greatly appreciated!"

There are two floors to the office; one is lit like a modern normal office with proper overhead lighting. The other is very dark with little beams hung sporadically. The place where my team sits is near a small window, yes, but there is no overhead lighting and I'm already afraid this is going to be a problem. I've worked in a similar environment before and not only was it uncomfortable but I got periodic headaches. I rushed to take this job because I feel like I have to and want to make it work. 

What should I do? Should I bring my concerns up to my manager before I start? Or wait until I get there? 

There are some options I was thinking, like maybe asking them to install an overhead light or possibly get a seat on that ""regular"" floor and come up by my team periodically/for meetings. This obviously brings me away from the team but would also allow me to be comfortable.

But i am support staff(hourly)

And they just changed the policy to make it apply to hourly employees.

This doesnt seem right to me. Faling to report it or not reporting it or doing inapproved work can lead to termination.

My outside work is done off hours or weekends/vacations and dwpending on the year can account for more income than my day job.

Also since i am just a contractor i could end up working for anyone if i took on the work.

Before she would yell at me in front of co-workers for things that werent my fault, she had returned my comp time forms telling me to keep track of my time and take it later instead of turning it in to hr to be added to my leave balence. 

She also told me to work and then when i turned in the sheets she refused to sign it and sent me the policy.

I also wasnt getting yearly performance reviews like i was supposed to.

I went to hr last sept and we had a meeting with hr, my boss, and myself.

Nothing came of it except my boss gave me a first hand master class of deflecting and came into the meeting with a list of my faults.

No kidding
1 i am not gentle enough with unskilled users.
Not that i am mean or short. Just not gentle enough

2 i was doing something she told me to yeara after she told me to do it.

She streched that into an hour meeting

She did start doing comp time forms but since then has actively prevented me from getting comp time and she never gave me the performance review she was supposed to.

Cut to now.
She has continued to raise her voice at me.
We had a meeting last monday.
A co-worker had her employees she supervises do something that i had told her several times was a bad idea for them to do.

It was not done properly and that is what the meeting was about.
She spent the first 3rd of the meeting question me seemongly trying to find a way for her to put it as mu fault with an agressive tone.

Until she finally got to my co-worker. Co-work admited she told them to do it.
Her tone and line of questioning completely changed. From staring daggers to soft.

I am early 30s male. My boss is (guessing) later 60's. Co-worker is later 50's.

I had a change in my family routine. I need to pick my son up from work every other friday. Drop him off the following monday. I can drop him off and get to work on time but picking him up will require me to leave 2 hrs early.
I requested to work 30 extra mins the preceeding 4 days that week each week i need to do this to make up my 2 hrs. She denied this and advised me i will have to use a leave request every time.

On the flip side another lady that reports to her leaves early frequently(not 2 hrs they are mich closer) to go pick up her grandchildren and she does not make up this time.

I know it is either because i am male, younger, or she just doesn't like me. 

I dont think i have anything reportable at this time outside of her not following throigh on the outcome of what she was supposed to do last time.

My question is this:
What do i need to start doing, logging, recording to protect myself?"

Another investigation happened but nothing really changed--no one talks about me within earshot now and my boss is nice on paper but my workload is dwindling, it's harder to get replies to my emails.

A few months ago, I was denied a previously promised promotion with no details or reasoning and after several rounds of questing was told a month later that the role is being renamed and its a position that i now have to apply and interview for--my boss was promoted this year and I now have to interview with him and several other people I mentioned in my report to the director for  a job that that apparently has few availability. I don't think this is fair, but don't even know how to address it because going to HR has done nothing in past and this probably doesn't break any laws.

Is it okay for them to make me interview with people I reported, and is there any chance I'll be given a fair shot? Is there anyway to save my career in this industry?

The corporation is located world wide, but I currently work at a location located in California. I had an unforeseen medical issue arise last month and was hospitalized. This lead to my doctor putting me on an immediate leave of absence. After the hospitalization, I was prescribed medication which can have many negative side effects, so my doctor decided to extend my leave to give my body and mind time to stabilize on it. In all i have been off of work for a little over a month. Having said that, I am now at another crossroads, and was hoping for some advice on what to do. The dosage of my medication is being increased, which leads again to the possibility of not being at a stable place to return to work. My doctor is encouraging me to continue the leave, but is giving me the opportunity to make the decision on how I feel. I am scared of the repercussion that take place for extending my LOA multiple times? This would be the third time I am asking for an extension. I also am in a position where I am relied heavily on at the moment, and I feel terrible about having to leave everyone to fend for themselves. But, I know that I need to put my health first, defintely before a job even if I love it! I am new to the corporate world, so this type of stuff is new for me. What is the possibility of being fired for extending a leave? Am I putting a target on back for taking the time off? 
As well, because the company is so big I do not directly deal with the HR department of my company for leave of absences. There is a 3rd party company that I send everything through to and they in turn communicate with the HR department on information on my LOA. They have a 5 business day turn around time, so it makes it very difficult to ask questions. It is completely stressing me out at a time where I should solely be focused on my health. It is a very personal health issue, so it makes me very uncomfortable to talk to my direct supervisor about it. I called him and told him, at the beginning, that i'm going on leave and its too personal to talk about, also that I am being hospitalized. He seemed very upset that I didn't want to tell him exactly what's going on. He just basically said he couldn't help and I have to communicate with the leave team. So if anyone has any advice, please help. Defintely from a ""HR"" perspective, what would be the best course of action? Am i overthinking it? Should I take the extra month to ensure I'm good? My greatest fear is not being ready to go back but still going, and having to go immediately back into a LOA (that seems worst to me)!!

Compression review, reviews of compression of salaries between supervisors and their subordinates are conducted on a regular basis to determine if there is a requirement for ventilation between annual salaries. Then it lists various factors (salary scale, current salary, education etc.). Finally, If ventilation is determined to be required, a minimum ventilation of 5% will be deemed appropriate.

I asked when I had to go to LabCorp (this worked at previous companies and it did here as well), and the HR rep said that it won‚Äôt be needed... ‚Äúmost likely‚Äù. 

I checked online to find that some did and some didn‚Äôt. 

I know I should be on the cautionary side of it, but I was wondering if it‚Äôd be common for someone to have their test on the first day. I start in three weeks or so, so no real worries as of now. But I just wanted to see if any HR professionals have seen their companies do so, etc. 

It doesn‚Äôt seem like an efficient use of resource to do the test on day one after the background checks and documents rather than to do a pre-employment screening. I know it‚Äôs just my opinion, but perhaps you guys may have some input on this.

What do you think? Thanks!"
Forced to sign casual contract from permanent,AskHR,8,d5nwqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d5nwqy/forced_to_sign_casual_contract_from_permanent/,1,1568786193.0,"We are located in Australia, WA to be specific . 

My husband is a Permanent Part time staff member at his company and has been on an ongoing contract for 13 months.  He requested in July, 2018 to become a casual employee due to his change in availability.  The senior manager who is still in this position advised him they wanted him to be a Permanent Part time employee and would accomodate his new availability.  

On the 27th of July, 2018, we sent a copy to Senior Management of what his availability would look like up until April,  2020 which includes 4 days a week of 24 hour availability, 3 days of availability that range from morning,  mid morning,  afternoon and night shifts. On the 11th of August his company issued a permanent part time contract for 20 hours and put 24/7 availability, it also states that should he be dismissed he will be paid 2 weeks unless it's a case of gross misconduct.  In the 13 months he has been permanent part time he has been working 40+ hours,  except for periods of approved annual leave.  

His direct line manager resigned 3 weeks ago and has been given a new line manager in this time,  senior management has not changed.  

Yesterday,  his new manager approached him and presented him with a new Casual contract with a promotion that Is 3 levels above his current pay grade.  He requested he sign it immediately as his availability isn't 'true' availability and can no longer be accommodated.  The contract is effective as of the 16th of September.  My husband refused to sign the contract and requested time to look into it.  

I have made contact with Fair Work Ombudsman who weren't able to offer any insight on where he stands in the matter,  only if he believes it's unfair dismissal to take it to the tribunal.  I contacted the Tribunal and they referred me onto a free legal service for employment but after 3 hours on hold I hung up.  I can't visit these people in person or email them.  They only offer over the phone advice.  

Last month,  he was awarded Employee of the Month for the 3rd time,  there is no performance issues that he's been made aware of,  he never has time off,  is always the relied upon staff member for sick leave and last minute shift cancellations which reinforces that his availability isn't really the issue.  

I have a feeling that they are trying to get him to sign a casual contract so they can effectively terminate him without issue but I am unsure of the reasoning for this.  His promotion also reinforces this idea,  as if the dollar figure would tempt him to not question it.  

The other thing is whether they no longer want a part time employee,  if he signs this they don't need to pay a redundancy.  

The ONLY issue I can see is that he has been head hunted by another employer,  his recruitment process for the new employer hasn't interfered with his current employment at all. We are yet to receive his contract for this new employer so want to try prevent being in a position where he becomes unemployed,  especially if the new place falls through.  


For Australian members on this forum,  where does he stand? Does he have to sign it?  Can they retaliate? 

For the HR members who aren't familiar with Australian law,  we want to send this email but we also don't want it to be inflammatory to the HR department. IS this appropriate to send?  



Dear HR director, 

After due consideration, I feel the change of contract would not benefit me. I wish to remain on my current work contract and look forward to a continued profitable association for us both.

kind regards, 


Thanks for reading this far,  I look forward to your advice.  

TLDR: my husband's employer is trying to force him to give up tenure and permanency."

Put in a very uncomfortable situation with my manager,AskHR,5,d5nrd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d5nrd7/put_in_a_very_uncomfortable_situation_with_my/,3,1568785520.0,"I work as a software developer for a medium sized company and our team structure is that we have two developers per business unit.  The expectation is that the developers work in tandem with one another with a product owner to solve business problems on our online platform.

Recently I was paired with a developer that I knew to be struggling.  My manager had informed me he was on a performance improvement plan.  My product owner had gone to my manager (the manager of all software developers) regarding his performance.  I have gone to my manager and expressed issues with his performance and how it was affecting me.  I have been deeply frustrated working with this individual in the brief time we‚Äôve been working together.

When I went to my manager he effectively put the onus on me to have the other developer terminated.  He told me to document performance issues, keep track of what‚Äôs been going on, getting something resembling a paper trail displaying that he could not do the work.  His justification is that because we‚Äôre on our own team with the product owner he doesn‚Äôt have enough insight into the situation to take action.  I am deeply uncomfortable with this situation.

My intent with going to my manager was to get him more involved so he can see the issues first hand, and deal with them as he saw fit - perhaps he could get involved more so that the other developers poor performance wasn‚Äôt affecting me as much.  Reassign the struggling developer to be in a situation where my manager could monitor his performance more closely.  This has had the opposite affect and I‚Äôm very upset how things have gone in the last week.

Part of me thinks I have to go to HR for this as it‚Äôs my manager that‚Äôs put me in this situation but that‚Äôs something I can‚Äôt walk back from and will permanently alter my relationship with my manager, whom I‚Äôve actually had a good relationship with in the two years I‚Äôve been at the company.

I have been working at my place of employment for a little over a few months... and over the last two months. I developed a recurring skin infection they may believe to be MRSA (will need further testing), I have been in/out of my PCPs office for antibiotics, which seem to work in interim...

Last Monday, I missed my period and went to Planned Parenthood where they informed me that I was not pregnant. They made mention to see my PCP since I was underweight, which could have contributed to my lack of cycle.

Which leads me here: I have battled an eating disorder for as long as I could remember. I was always cautious of how much I weighed, how much I ate...anything to keep me thin. I think I have been doing pretty well so far, but my friends have also noticed my weight loss. In addition to having depression...it's a lot to take on.

Last Wednesday, my skin infection had returned and I informed my boss around 6a that I will be going to urgent care (did not specify why). The same day, I did not eat anything and had nearly passed out on the train ride home. When I arrived home, I just sat and cried about how I need to seek help for my issues...I made the acknowledgement it was dire. So the same day I had emailed my director essentially saying I needed to see a specialist immediately for an ongoing health issue and that I would return tomorrow (Tuesday) after making the necessary appointments. She said OK, I had the sick hours so no problem. Saw a specialist for my skin and they made two perceptions. The following day (thurs) saw my PCP where she perspired me something to help with my depression and disorder and informed me I needed to see a therapist.

On Friday she emailed me asking for doctors notes for all days missed, which I was surprised because policy read that notes were not necessary unless I was planning to take LOA. I replied and said I did not obtain any for my Wed/Thurs visit...she responded and said she needed a doctors letter that I was in fact treated. I was taken aback...I'm not sure what to do.

I don't foresee myself taking any further days off unless it's for follow-up appointments and I am planning to do outpatient treatment on the weekends. I feel like I may be forced to disclose my medical issues for the sake of keeping my job.,,and I would rather not share my diagnosis (especially my eating disorder) - especially if I do not see if it is necessary

I am unsure how to address this with them and politely refuse to provide a diagnosis if I now for certain it will not greatly effect my work and to date, it has not.

tl;dr: was diagnosed with several medical conditions that are treatable with meds and outpatient care (weekends). Director is demanding to see notes for absences and diagnosis.

Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you!'

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thank you for your helpful responses. Sick time for me was definitely not abused. Took Friday to call some places for consultation for therapy and on Monday met with a couple of them. Have my first appt this Sunday. I'm going back in today and will address my concerns with them."

I  live in New York and I work in a restaurant. The job I'm doing is a managing job, itself supposed to  be easy for me, because I do have the experience. They hired me a  couple of weeks ago, but I want to ask the corporate HR to transfer me to  another location, because I just can't work with my supervisor. I have a feeling she hates me and I don't  feel comfortable working with her and with some other co-workers. My supervisor makes my schedule and week by  week I get less hours, this way my income is low too... I don't want to quit or ""no show"", because this corporate is big and they have several locations in the city... What are my  rights to say to HR in this case?"

My manager is at the regional level; he isn't here often and this location is his favorite as it is his only location that performs and meets the metrics. 

I'm the only female tech, and I'm used to being uncomfortable and around edgy environments, but this place just feels a step up. 

Racist jokes fly back and forth left and right, and that gets to me, even as a white woman. I'm dating a POC and I know he would be uncomfortable by their weird emphasis on race. Stuff like mocking customer's accents, to making fun of the one immigrant worker using some really lame stereotypes (he's the lead tech, and kinda just laughs along). 

The men call women bitches, and make comments about the women they find attractive, and they will call the ones that were rude or standoffish whores. 

There's also another tech several years older than me and at the same level who lacks any social kindness. He's a know-it-all who will criticize my every action in ways he doesn't speak to any of the others like. I literally can't do anything without him looking over my shoulder and telling me what I'm doing wrong. I'm the new one there, but I'm not new to technical work. He also throws the word ""retarded"" around which is very upsetting. 

I don't know where to go to from here. I'm getting closer and closer to walking out, but I'm trying to see if I got this other job I interviewed with first. I wouldn't mind moving elsewhere in this company, the previous location I was at was one of my favorite workplaces ever. 

If I were to make a complaint, I feel like it probably won't go well for me. But I feel like both companies ought to be made aware of this sort of behavior going on, and I'd rather work driving for Uber than continue like this"

We have an HR generalist for my office but they're on vacation so I'm reaching out here.

One of my parents has been employed at a new company for less than a year.  They've been struggling in their performance as they have been regularly forgetting small tasks, repeating the same information to their boss, etc.  Most people chalked it up to an aging issue, however, they saw a nonspecialist who diagnosed them with some brain damage.  Turns out a concussion from 2018 rattled their brain more than we realized and they're suggesting a cognitive skills therapy for 4-6 months.  The specialist suggested they may consider ""disability.""  

When we looked into FMLA, we saw that you have to be working at the company for more than one year (which my parent hasn't).  The company does have more than 50 employees and participate in FMLA but the time there doesn't meet the requirements.  

I'm wondering what options, if any, does my parent have in regards to taking time off or keeping the job secured.  They have less than 5 years before retirement and we all know job hunting at that age doesn't get any easier.

At the end of the call, she told me that if the hiring manager selected my application, he would contact me directly, which he did a couple of days later (by phone and by mail, so I have both his contacts), to schedule an on-site.

Then I had a really good interview with the hiring manager about a month ago; at the end of the interview, he also said that if they want to pursue with my application, I would get a call from HR to setup an on-site with HR this time. He also added that if in the meantime I received another offer, I could reach out to him directly and he might be able to speed up the process. 

Couple of days later, I received a call from another HR to schedule the HR interview with her colleague (the HR rep that did the phone screen). 

I did this HR interview beginning of last week, and I've been told at the end of it that they had another candidate to interview at the end of the same week, and that I would get an answer by phone beginning of next week if I were to be selected, a rejection mail otherwise. I had the feeling at the end of the interview that it didn't went well, so I'm not expecting much out of it. However, I do have other HR interviews scheduled in a couple of weeks, and it would be great if I could get some feedback as to how I did, and where I failed. I'm also curious to know whether it was the hiring manager or the HR rep, or both, that didn't validate my application.

I'm planning to wait until Thursday before I follow up if I don't get any answer in the meantime. But I don't know who to call. Should I get in touch with the hiring manager that I met about a month ago, or should I call HR. Who would give me the best and honest feedback ? Also when I went there, I was under the impression that the HR rep was training someone to take over her work, so she might not even be working there anymore. But in the meantime, I also don't want to contact someone that I met more than a month ago, he might not even remember me.

Last question : I'm suspecting that I gave a too high of salary expectation during the HR interview, should I asked them what they had in mind for the salary range ? It would help me narrow it down for the next interviews with similar position and industry. But I also heard those information are kept secret and that companies pay a lot of money to get those estimates from surveys, so they are unlikely to just give them out."

To select their enrollments twice - once on a form to submit to the broker/carrier for enrollment, and once on our payroll platform so the correct amount gets deducted from their paychecks. However employees can enroll on our payroll platform right away so that their first paychecks see their premiums deducted right away, and some have done exactly that but it strikes me that they should only see the deductions starting the month they have coverage.

"[KY, US] Meeting with HR",AskHR,2,d506rb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d506rb/ky_us_meeting_with_hr/,12,1568666856.0,"TL;DR: Meeting HR in several hours, I think, but I'm worried I'll be cast aside instead of having my issues dealt with properly. Need advice on what to do and what not to do.

Later today, I have a meeting with HR, or at least I assume so--the person just below department manager (I think this is the title?) said he'd decide what to do. The reason for the meeting is to address whether or not a few of my coworkers have been verbally harassing me during work.

This came up because I'd asked for the department manager to listen to the coworkers' conversations in order to be my evidence of harassment, as my testimony vs theirs will result in ""he said, she said"" scenarios in which they'll lie to cover themselves. However, the person below department manager said that my accusations are unprofessional and would require HR present to make an accurate judgment, and he claimed he wants to talk to the individuals I am accusing.

To be clear, this is not the first time I've gone to the department manager or her second-in-command over this. I've requested this before, but the department manager finished her investigation less than a day and on a day I wasn't working, no less, before noting that it was just the usual crude talk--nothing to do with me.

There's another major instance where I've gone to the department manager for indirect interference with work via repeated petty acts to hinder me, but have been shut down on getting security footage to confirm my claims--at first because the department manager was too busy to look, then because she couldn't get access to the login to look for it. I've no idea whether it's true or not, but I doubt it, as she has stated that he merely didn't know what to do--despite his being more experienced than me by at least a year, I believe.

To be clear, I've waited for weeks at a time to build a history of the prior occurrences before going to these people.

Edit: the accusations are as follows: they remark on the way my butt moves when I'm scrubbing dishes, occasionally noting that I must be thinking of dick, as well as remarking on my expressions--how depressed I look or how I'm going to cry, sometimes going so far as to remark, when I smile, that I'm crazy--despite my smile being forced so as not to cry. I've had them call me special, even once saying that my head is big, but my brain is small. They note that I'm not a hard worker, despite my efforts to finish my main duties early and my cleaning my area on the occasions I'm ahead, even going so far as to gossip about how I just want to leave work early, in a way that derides the effort I put into catching up on my dishes--before I got to this speed, I've had someone else once remark on how slow I was, in a condescending tone. These comments, among others, rotate by the day. These comments don't crop up all day, however--just daily.

Given these, what should I do? Given that the people I've spoken to thus far refused to take the measures needed to appropriately confirm gossip, I have a sinking feeling on this matter. As a precaution, I've already begun looking into getting a job elsewhere and in other departments in the workplace, though I doubt I'll find anything meaningful soon enough."

Names have been changed, but here it goes..

I've worked at a fast food restaurant from mid February up til yesterday. 
I and several other employees have been having issues with our GM (long before I got there).  She is not a very nice person to begin with. My first impression of her was not a great one. 
I've experienced myself and have been told from others that she is verbally abusive, she will yell and talk down to her staff, she will blow up out of no where and then wonder why everyone is in a bad mood, she is perpetually late by an hour or more. Having to be at work at 11a.m and one of the Managers has to call her which wakes her up and then she gets ready and comes to work. The schedules are always messed up. I could go on and on, I've wrote down a list of these things and sent it to her bosses boss that is connected with the owner of the few restaurants they own. I'm sorry for the lack of details, I'm trying to make this cut and to the point. The GM has been toxic and half-assing it for a long time. Apparently her boss didn't even know or they just brushed it under the rug. Until Friday. We had a group chat were all the employees could talk and what have you, and after 6-7 months of all my anger and resentment, something broke the stray at the camel's back and I started indirectly saying things on the group chat. Things that the GM does but I never said her name or tagged her or anything. Finally she saw it and called the store and talked to two of the managers working at the time all confused about the whole thing. She had no idea she was being such a rude and disrespectful person. We all basically fear her ya know it's like we'll just pretend these things didn't happen. I got tired of all that and I know I went about exposing it the wrong way. By the end of my shift her boss came to speak with me and my temper was flared up and I said some not nice things. She had already spoken with a manger before me who agreed with everything I was saying, she just said my approach was all wrong. I understand now. I ended up yelling and cursing, then storming out because I had a strong feeling nothing would ever be done. I came back 20 minutes later and I ask if she fired me, she said no, I said ok I'll see you tomorrow. The next morning (Saturday) I come in, she immediately takes me outside and fires me for breaking code of conduct rules. Meanwhile the GM personally messaged me cursing at me , which she conveniently didn't screenshot, and neither did I..but as soon as she fired me I got up and walked of yelling ""I knew it! I knew this would happen!"" As well as cursing other things. She called the cops for I don't know what reason I left the property immediately. I heard she told the police I was throwing things at her!! 

In the midst of me calling and asking for HR number and them never answering the phone, the women who fired me, send me her bosses number. I called her and she said they don't have an HR department. She told me to write down everything the GM did or does and send it to her. So I did. She said she would investigate. 

I want to add I was an excellent worker. I'm not trying to be egotistical! I did a good job and the other managers loved and praised me most days. I've only called in 2 times the 7 months I worked there. 

A few questions I have are.. the obvious is there anything else I can do?
Can I still get unemployment? 

How hypocritical is this. I break 1 code of conduct which is the Social Media policy, she makes people have panic attacks and tears them new ones weekly. Seriously I am considering therapy because I've never had a job cause me this much stress and termoil. When I would see her come into work I would shake like a dog because I was expecting her to blow up at any moment!

If needed I can provide the backstory that prompted this question.

Edit: more info

  

This is quite long, but it's the most clear and concise version of events.

I work in food service in a kitchen at a school and right now we have 3 people out, so we all have a lot to do to cover those spots in addition to our own responsibilities. I just started a new position within the company the job also has longer hours and lots different tasks than my old position. A coworker has taken over my previous post and had asked me to help him learn the job even though we were all given a list stating our assigned task for the day, but there are things not on the list that I used to do and I said would inform him of said task as I thought of them and he said OK. Although, every single time he had to go check with the manager to see if he had to or should do it if it was not on his list.

Wednesday morning he cornered me in the cooler and apologized for something (really not sure for what or why, at this point we hadn't yet quarreled) and told me he had believed I was trying to order him around and as he said give him more work so I would have less to do during the day. He mentioned talking with manger and she explained that in this new position I have many more responsibilities and may ask for help, not really sure what this had to do with me telling him about things I used to do, but I digress. When I mention these things I merely said I used to do them, I did not tell him he had to, I may have asked him to resume one of these tasks (refilling fruit at the other stations), but I did not order it. 

Later that morning I tried to remind him (because I genuinely thought he forgot, cause I do the exact same thing) about a counter that he had been working at needed to wiped down he practically bit my head off and whirled around to ask the manager if I was in charge of him and what my responsibilities were. Looking back I probably could have been more tactful in trying to bring this up or just kept my mouth shut entirely and minded my own business, but I was tired and occasionally suffer from foot-in-mouth syndrome. I still did not order him even though it may have inadvertently come out that way and he definitely seemed to perceive it that way.

Coworker did not get the answer he wanted because manager told him that in the event she and the assistant manager are out sick I‚Äôm next in line for being in charge. He got very angry and stormed off saying he was going to walk out. I later attempted to apologize to him for possibly overstepping and did try to explain that I really did think he forgot to do it and I wasn‚Äôt trying to order him about, he just nodded.

The rest of the day and all of Thursday I did my best to avoid or ignore him and then Thursday afternoon I learned something new. I guess he talked to the manager and told her that he was so angry at me on Wednesday he wanted to assault me for it. 

I decided to try to ignore him for the rest of his stay and then reneged on that attempt on Friday, when against my better judgement I went to him with a sanitation concern (a server had stuck an un-gloved hand into a container) as he was standing right next to the person (less than 2ft away) when it happened. My reasoning was that if it had be me at that station this would be something I would want to know to keep an eye out for it in the future. Alas, I didn‚Äôt get to say that bit, he just started getting belligerent and when I said I didn‚Äôt want to fight about it he turned around and walked off to find the manager to say that I was ordering him again. I was jumped on for it and blamed for inciting his anger because I tried to talk to him. 

I said: ‚ÄúForget it! I don‚Äôt care anymore!‚Äù and walked away, manager thought that I was walking out/quitting, I wasn‚Äôt, I just went to the bathroom to cry.

My manager acts like I'm the one that has started this whole thing and that the coworker getting angry, wanting to quit and wanting to assault me, was my fault. Not once has the manager actually tried to resolve this, they have made no effort whatsoever.

To my knowledge, based on her actions and words, I don't believe that she told him that no matter how angry and upset you are this kind of comment is absolutely not ok in the work place. She told me she is hoping he'll calm down after a while and just stay, that way she won't lose another employee and be one step further to a full crew.   
 

She also doesn't like how I've been bringing it up to her so much (I'm just trying to understand) and told me she doesn't want to hear about it anymore.

She didn't report it to HR & when I asked her to, because I wanted it to be on record in case something did happen, she manipulated me into dropping it because it might put me in a bad light because I'm ‚Äúslow‚Äù at my job but somehow still had time to pick on him, to me this seems like she has all but admitted she thinks I'm the bad guy in all of this. I think this says she wants more to placate this one employee over ensuring a safe and harmonious work environment.

Prior to all of this we had gotten along quite well, is it possible he's jealous of my promotion and has just decided to lash out?  
 

Not too sure it's going be very productive to go on pretending this employee doesn‚Äôt exist for the next 8 & 1/2 months, I really don‚Äôt know what to do, as quitting is not really an option for me right now.

If it matters, some additional info: I‚Äôm female with ADHD‚ÄìInattentive Type, coworker is male and several decades older than I am. 

The reason we are short 3 employees is because 1 is waiting on a full medical release to come back to work, 1 (the assistant manager) is out sick and the 3rd quit recently for a unrelated reason."
Advice on how to handle difficult coworkers?,AskHR,48,d4icnf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d4icnf/advice_on_how_to_handle_difficult_coworkers/,7,1568568769.0,"I‚Äôve started a job not too long ago. It‚Äôs a much bigger company than I‚Äôve ever worked for and it‚Äôs a completely different industry. I‚Äôm trying my best to adjust to the pacing and the environment, but there are just a couple people that are making it hard for me. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm gonna come off as a sensitive baby, but frankly, they make me feel bad. They make me feel stupid. 

1. There‚Äôs a typical mean girl. She‚Äôs a higher position (not a supervisor, thank god). She‚Äôs very condescending, cuts me off, calls me sweetheart when I‚Äôm not understanding something or when she‚Äôs correcting me (and not in a sweet grandma way, she‚Äôs just a few years older), and literally yells at me in front of everyone. She‚Äôs makes me feel embarrassed and just dumb.  I dread every time she‚Äôs assigned to train me. 

2. Not a huge deal, but some of the dudes don‚Äôt say my name. They call for me like, ‚ÄúAYY do me a favor.‚Äù

3. I share my office with a guy. And his manager comes in and says ‚Äúwhat are you doing? Playing with your balls? Why don‚Äôt you let her (me) play with your balls?‚Äù Another time he makes a comment about Asians regarding our eyes and to ‚Äúwatch out‚Äù for us because we could be sleeping. I did give a dirty look both instances and he‚Äôs stop so I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs worth reporting.

Overall I feel undermined and disrespected. It really bothers me that there‚Äôs a huge possibility people wouldn‚Äôt treat me this way if I were older or if I were a different race or sex.  

I‚Äôm still a fairly young professional and since I‚Äôm new, I‚Äôm very scared to stir the pot. Especially since these people are actually quite popular people for some reason... I consider myself a very polite and  respectful person. It really flusters me when it‚Äôs not reciprocated.

Spouse About to Begin New Job with Surgery Looming,AskHR,3,d4erl8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d4erl8/spouse_about_to_begin_new_job_with_surgery_looming/,4,1568543576.0,"*Throwaway account because my main account contains identifying information.*

**State: Minnesota** 

My spouse is about to accept a job offer for a position that is beginning in October. They are also in the process of getting pre-authorization from their insurance company to undergo a medically-necessary gender affirmation surgery that includes a two week recovery period. At this point, it can take up to a month before they can actually schedule the surgery, which could be another month or two after that. 

How can my spouse approach the situation with their new employer's HR department? They'll be calling their HR contact on Monday to verbally accept the job offer (it is with a medium-sized mental health chain). Insurance won't be an issue, unless the surgery is delayed until they turn 26 early next year, as we know that their parent's insurance will cover the entire surgery in full, whereas my insurance will not. I'm thinking that my spouse should explain that they are in the process of scheduling this medically-necessary surgery, not going into specific details about the nature of the surgery unless pressed, and to verify that the employer will work with them to ensure that they can still be employed pre and post-surgery. From what I read online, it seems *highly*  unlikely (and possibly illegal) for the employer to rescind the job offer due to the impending surgery and necessary recovery leave, however, my spouse wants to inform HR early so that they are aware of the situation. My spouse is even willing to delay the surgery until closer to the holiday season, when it will be less busy, in hopes to accommodate the employer's needs while giving them a chance to get comfortable in the position before being gone for two weeks. We're also thinking that they can take unpaid leave, as they'd be just shy of qualifying for short-term disability and would have nearly zero PTO hours accumulated by the date of the surgery. 

Any advice or anything to know before my spouse calls HR back next week?"

There is a boss (we'll call her C) who has been on a war path for a while now. She absolutely cannot take constructive criticism, responsibility for her actions/inactions, nor questions of any kind if they come from a man. (For reference, I'm a woman too.)

C is best friends with the HR rep and uses her as her own personal lackey to fire people for purely personal reasons. She also routinely engages her in gossip about our coworkers. (We're in an at will state.) C can't work well with people from other cultures and our company is diverse. She is poisoning the well and destroying morale not just on her own team, but on ours as well. She stifles any attempt of her engineers to learn new skills and hinders them from working with us in the way that we all need and want.

I fear that C's actions, and those of her lackey are going to get the company sued. I cannot say anything due to HR's inability to be impartial. Is there any other recourse that I have? I can't prove discrimination because I think that a lot of her actions and hostility stem from cognitive bias and defense mechanisms. She's also very good at presenting an entirely different face to upper management. 

If she continues to fire our best engineers with impunity, I fear that even if we don't get sued our projects will fail and eventually I will be laid off as a result of her terrible management. C actually got a promotion last year by claiming an engineer's work as her own. She tried to stop him from even doing the project but conceded when we all agreed it was beneficial. She then fired him so that the source wouldn't be revealed to upper management, but we all know it happened.

C also tends to fire people she puts in leadership roles because they don't meet expectations that she never lays out for them in the first place. They were all great performers though. Sometimes she fires on the basis that an engineer wasn't collaborating with others, when the rest of us work with them just fine. She's the only one who sees it, and I believe many times it stems from her lack of cultural sensitivity. I know that turnover shouldn't be this high in my field and at a company so many of us love. Is there anything I can do to help improve the situation?

Alaska Public Employee / Intent To Return To Work / Payback of Employer Contributions to My Insurance,AskHR,3,d47qf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d47qf0/alaska_public_employee_intent_to_return_to_work/,4,1568508787.0,"As an Alaska public employee, I am entitled 18 weeks of FMLA.  My 18 weeks expires the last week in September.

Approximately a month ago, I contacted my employer and notified them I had been cleared for light duty beginning September 1st.  I bought a ticket back to Alaska. This is an important point because it proves my intent to return to work.  (I had to leave the state for surgery due to the remote location of my home in Alaska.)  Before I got home, I was informed that I would not be allowed to return to work until I was able to perform all job at 100%.

During my FMLA, I continued to pay my portion of my health premiums and the employer continued to pay theirs.  Yesterday, I went in to pay my portion for October and was notified that, because my FMLA ends the last week of September, they are unable to accept any more payments from me.  I have questioned them as to how I am supposed to maintain insurance if they will not accept payments from me.  I have yet to receive a response.

Here are my questions:

1.  I understand, if I had no intention of returning, they could charge me for the previously paid employer contribution to my healthcare premium.  I have proven intent (email, plane ticket) to return.  Am I required to pay the previous employer contributions even though I had intent to return?

2.  My original plan was to return to work and give 30 days notice.  Them not allowing me to return to light duty has created a financial situation where I am unable to return to Alaska. In this case, am I required to pay the previous employer contributions?  Again, the intention part...

3.  If they terminate me after my FMLA runs out, am I required to repay the previous employer contributions? 

4. My physician's instructions are that I am to remain on light duty until November 5th.  I cannot be out of work that long and have found a job in my home town (in Oregon) that will make accommodations until I am 100%.  Does this put me on the hook for repaying the  employer contributions, since I am unable to give them 30 days notice?

5. Lastly, I feel there is some favoritism/discrimination in that the HR person (who is required to be available to employees for HR issues) has moved and is working remotely from Maine.  The medical director, who usually takes call and sees patients, has moved and is doing her administrative duties from Washington State.  I however, (even though I rarely see patients and my job is about 98% behind a desk) am not being allowed to work INSIDE THE FACILITY on light duty.  I feel I could have some type of case here if they do terminate me or require repayment of the previous employer contributions.  

I apologize for the wall of text.  I feel there are so many interpretations and subtleties.  Any help would be greatly appreciated."

I've been keeping a recent log trying to gain consistency to file a report for a new manager that I think may be out to get me because I have voiced dislike of her friend at one time, who was a former colleague of mine. 

Backstory: My former colleague has stolen numerous sales from me and have put me into bad positions with my initial clients because of her behavior with sharking my customers. I asked for an internal transfer of my time and title and I was able to be moved over to a different location so I can eliminate any friction I had with my colleague sharking me. The manager that ended up getting hired on with my team was coincidentally my former colleague's friend. I didn't know this initially that the manager hired was close to my former colleague. There was a day at work where they asked the sales team if it would be okay if we had sales reps from other teams come help on days we were short-staffed. I said I didn't mind but I refused to work with my former colleague and that higher management knew about the situation.

After a few weeks, I've been getting pulled to the side more and more by this one new manager and I'm starting to feel some type of way about it--like I am personally targeted. I've been documenting all instances of any interactions I have regarding the one-on-one meetings with my manager or any situations that I have seen with my manager sabotaging my transactions with my clients.

They've given him two options: a severance if he writes a training manual for his replacement OR he's required to save the company X dollars over the next year (he's fired if he doesn't). He doesn't trust them because he's saved money in the past and they haven't given him credit.

Banned from opening windows,AskHR,28,d3np99,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d3np99/banned_from_opening_windows/,6,1568402082.0,"Hi all,

Just hoping to get a bit of advice really. (For context) In the UK, just hit the end of summer, still warm days in the office (lots of big windows), but we now also have the office cold spreading round the building. We have a shutter system, closes over the windows. Due to someone leaving their window open in one office repeatedly, and breaking the shutters, we have been banned from opening the windows. Our building has two floors, it's not a high rise or anything.

We have an aircon system, however the office I am in, has no door, and immediately opposite, and again immediately to the right, we have a door that opens into a stairwell, and a door that opens into the main foyer respectively. This means that our aircon system does not work correctly, as it can't deal with the changes in temp from constantly opening the other doors, different corridor temp etc. Basically, it is always either too hot, or too cold, and never hits the temp you try to set it at. It also means, due to this rule, we have 0 fresh air in the building, it is all recycled through the aircon (hence the reference to the office cold, I'm not sure on this, but I feel like this is why it spreads so quickly).

We have spoken to buisness support and HR about the aircon, and about no fresh air etc, it has fallen on deaf ears, they will not do anything about it, will not look into us getting a door, and we're still banned from opening the windows. I'm not sure if I have a leg to stand on here, or if it is just a case of put-up or shut-up. Was wondering if they have any sort of duty of care in this matter, and are just trying to blag us so they don't have to do anything?

I‚Äôve finally hit my brick wall with stress/anxiety/depression whatever at this point and I really don‚Äôt know what to do. More of a medical issue I know so I‚Äôm going to try and figure that out separately I guess.

My hope is maybe just maybe taking a couple weeks away from work would relieve my stress as I use to love my job.

My company provides STD (short term disability) and I believe I‚Äôd be covered under an FMLA but I have no idea where to begin or what even is covered. I‚Äôm down to one week of PTO which just is not enough time and I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll be out of PTO before I renew which is not for another 4-5 months which has its own stress going into the holidays.

My question: What is covered for FMLA vs LOA? Does FMLA mean they can‚Äôt fire me and I get my job back at the end? FMLA does not pay but I believe STD does but how do I find out what is covered? How do I start the process? Telling my doctor hey I want 4 weeks off for mental health without getting myself checked into the hospital is really my end goal as I‚Äôm hopeful I can take the time to repair myself.

This person was very loud, inappropriate and made calls to other companies we work with all while being on a type of live stream chatting on video with multiple people. We reported her for constantly talking about her sex life, how she would fight people and many other work inappropriate things. We were afraid she would be breaking HIPAA as she communicates with the other companies while on the live chat with at least 8 other people. We reported this to compliance on our company website and no reply from that report. 

We know she had a conversation with our manager because she came back complaining about people ‚Äúratting‚Äù on her. She became slightly more hostile but was no longer live chatting. We reported this as well. 

We told our manager we wanted it to be anonymous as it seems like she would want to retaliate and we did not want confrontation but we did not want this attitude to continue at work. 

The next week, one of the coworkers (let‚Äôs say Sally) that reported her, was also reported. Someone claimed it was because Sally said authorization in spanish and was not working. (Which made no sense because we speak to spanish speaking customers about authorizations) Our manager told her it was the person she had reported. 

So now we feel as if a handful of us are being retaliated on because the claims made against us have no support. (A few of use were called in to not talk too loud on our lunch) Our manager even told us it was possibly retaliation. And now that we know it is, our boss has made no efforts to escalate anything and it seems as though nothing was done about the possible breach of HIPAA.

1. 'i have EVER been convicted'

I checked YES to both. It never asked for details to any events...just a simple YES or NO to questions regarding Criminal Charges from the past.

**The truth is, i have 3 misdemeanors from 20 + yrs ago.** 


HOWEVER, when i received a copy of my criminal record report from the state (explanation required), it only FOUND 1 crime of which they needed further clarification.

**What happened to the other 2**??

* Am i now free to state 'no TO any other charges in the past???

I would think 'the STATE government' would have the most accurate information regarding backgrounds and be able to PULL that info based ss#, name and address.

Any reason we should not add this holiday time to our vacation policy?

We typically close our office the week between Christmas and New Year's and offer the 4-5 days paid as Vacation, but it has never been a written policy or official benefit. I'm advocating that we add this week to our black and white vacation policy. Can you guys see any reason what we would want to keep this ""gifted"" time OUT of the official policy? Here are the arguments as we see them"" 

Pros: 

* Can list the paid days as a benefit in the handbook and new hire summary
* Distinguishes us from other firms who do not offer this benefit (quite unique for our industry, can be a recruitment tool)
* Gives employees the security of knowing that the time will always be off - no wondering or assuming as holidays approach
* We can stop having this discussion about exactly what days we'll be closed every. single. year

Cons: 

* Should a business need come up that requires work over the holidays, it would be much harder to call resources in. While it's typically a pretty quiet time in the industry, the partners have a real business fear in being locked into doing absolutely no business for a week. 
* Partners cannot offer this time as a ""holiday bonus"" or ""cherry on top"" as they've previously phrased. It's just a given

&#x200B;

We've had some issues with employees tacking on PTO to the week off and losing a lot of productivity, so are planning these structures just to protect business interests: 

* max 2 weeks out of the office over the holidays (including the closed week)
* holiday PTO requests must be submitted by Oct. 31st (so that we can appropriately plan project schedules) 

&#x200B;

Any reason not to add these days to our vacation policy? Any thoughts on structuring our policy so that we're not giving too many allowances?"

"Her peer is acting like her manager, but he is not. Help me give her good advice?",AskHR,3,d3gtxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d3gtxy/her_peer_is_acting_like_her_manager_but_he_is_not/,4,1568361857.0,"
First things first, this company is small and does not have a dedicated HR person. It is associated with a larger organization that does have HR, but we have little to no contact with them.. All things like pay, PTO, etc go though an automated system. We do have hr-adjacent employees involved with hiring and onboarding, but that is all they do. We're located in the US.

I know ""Julie"" from work, we both are engineers, she started a while after me and is newer to the industry than me, and I've been trying to help her do well professionally. Teach her the ropes and all. Up till she was hired, I was the only woman in a team of 20 and I've had to work though some difficult stuff. And if I can help make things easier for women who enter the field, after me, I sure want to. Along with work stuff, we've also become pretty good friends.

She came to me with something she was having trouble with at work. During her internship with our company last year, her manager was ""John"" and her peer mentor was ""Dan"". She didn't tell anyone at the time, but Dan wasn't too good of a mentor. He actively discouraged her from going to other people for help or guidance, it seemed like he had a bit of an ego and wanted to be the only one guiding her work. He also talked down to her a lot. (Side note, none of this surprises me, I have worked with Dan as an equal, and even then he has an abrasive and domineering personality. In my experience, he is a poor communicator, and does not understand what the team is doing as a whole, while the rest of us communicate a lot more closely, and ask questions about what we don't understand)

Fast forward to this year, she's been hired full time. John as her direct manager. She's no longer mentored by Dan, they're on the same level in the company. 

This was about the time we started becoming friends, I didn't know her well when she was an intern because she really kept to herself then. This year, she told me about her trouble with Dan, and said that even now, he's being a pain. He seems to be telling her what to do, on parts of the project that she is in charge of. He went over her head, and over her manager John's head, to talk to the top boss at the office about the timeline of her work. And he is still being domineering about the work she is doing, even though it is her work and not his. He has his own totally separate tasks.

Julie went to our manager John about her role in the company, asking him to clarify if she was supposed to be managed by him or Dan. And he said in no uncertain terms that he was her direct manager, and she and Dan were peers.

But even after that, Dan is still acting like he is still her superior, trying to manage her time and her work. Sometimes his instructions conflict with John. And she wanted advice from me about how to resolve things. 

I want to tell her to go to John and tell him ""Dan has done XYZ relating to my work, those all seem like management tasks. And as he is not my manager, you are, could you please clarify his role on the project with him, so there is no further confusion? I understand he may be in the habit of managing my work, as he did when I was an intern, but now it is difficult having two people giving me conflicting guidance on XYZ topics.""

But... I know I have a bit of an overly direct bordering on confrontational way of addressing things. And I don't want to give Julie bad advice just because I'm annoyed on her behalf. Can I have some input on whether my advice is good, or if there is a better way to resolve things?

TLDR - I need a second opinion on the advice I want to give my friend from work"

Manager silently tries to force me into partially paying for a business trip,AskHR,5,d3bc14,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d3bc14/manager_silently_tries_to_force_me_into_partially/,4,1568338365.0,"Hello,

TLDR;

My current situation refers to a European office for a Silicon Valley corporation. My manager took it on himself to book me an additional few days on a future business trip for which he did not book accommodation. This means i would have to fork about $1k of my own money and also use some of my PTO days.

;TLDR

My manager approached me last week about the possibility of going on a business trip in about a month or so. He finally got the exact dates today and booked both the travel and accommodation as confirmed by the emails I've received. The major red flag is that my checkout of the hotel is a few days earlier than my flight back home. I found this out by pure luck, while browsing the emails, as my manager didn't see it as an important enough detail to mention as opposed to praising himself for upgrading my flight seat (which i didn't really care nor ask for). 

Without going into too much office politics, and this person's lack of work ethic, my main concern is what type of legal rights i have in this situation, especially considering I'm still in my first 90 days on the job. 

More precisely, I'm wondering if:

* he has the right to terminate my employment if i refuse to go under the current terms, OR 
* if i'm liable to any damages or compensation to the company if I inform them after the trial 90 days have passed, about refusing to go on that trip unless they pay for the whole duration. The cost is pretty high so I wouldn't want to risk working for them for free for a couple of months.

He did casually suggested earlier this week about the possibility of me spending a couple of days to explore the area but I absolutely refused to give him any form of confirmation. I genuinely find it outrageous for someone to take this kind of decisions for me without even asking.

Also, considering this guy is pretty vindictive (has given terrible evaluations to great former employees just for switching teams) but has the support of his manager, should any of the other options like contacting legal, HR or one of the higher ranking managers (apparently that's an option) make any difference or just make matters worse?

I'm genuinely at a loss. I really love the projects, the office, the team, I'm ahead of schedule and performing good enough so he would trust me more than a 2 year old colleague. However, this looks really toxic and has taken a toll both on my confidence in him and my motivation to put in any of my personal time in the future.

Thanks and looking forward to your answers."

I'm new to the workforce, recently graduated, and I'm unsure whether I'm overreacting to what seems like very unprofessional behavior from my boss and coworker, who have worked together for years. I would really appreciate any insight as to what my boundaries should be in addressing or not addressing this issue, as well as just your take on whether or not this arguing is acceptable for workplace conflict.

I started in May, but they have been snapping at each other a lot over the past few weeks. I get uncomfortable when my boss is short with my coworker (he has on three or four occasions gotten frustrated with my coworker, ""Joe,"" for belaboring his work, and said ""Just get it done, Joe!""), but lately I have been even more surprised by Joe raising his voice and getting angry with my boss: ""Fine! We're doing it your way! You win!"" after disagreeing about how to organize a shelf. Occasionally they will have ""you said XYZ"" ""no I didn't"" ""yes you did"" debates as well.

We are a tiny department of just us three, so I think I am usually the only witness to these spats. I will avoid their workspace if I hear them arguing, but if it sparks while we're working on something together, exiting is hardly an option. It's awkward as hell, and I hate any kind of conflict, so I feel weird just ignoring them."

I was told that me/my position does not fit in with the Strategic Plan. The letter that they provided me states that I was terminated due to ""At will employment."" A couple of months after I was hired, my job title changed to HR Specialist. My job duties were changed and I was never provided with a job description. I was also not informed of this change until after it happened. We hired someone in February to take over those responsibititles and I went back to doing what I had been doing originally. Then, one of our recruiters walked out and I was left to pick-up recruiting for an entire line of service.

Today I noticed that they posted an open Employee Relations Generalist position (this is the position that the person hired in February had until she stepped up to another position a couple of months ago). This position description is different than the one that I signed, and the job duties are different than what I was doing. With the knowledge that I have from before I was terminated, I do not believe that they are ever planning to fill my position.

So, was I actually laid off in a legal sense? I am worried about how this will affect my future. So far, I think I will be eligible for unemployment because I had no disciplinary action, negative evals, or anything else that they could use against me. But I am worried about how it will look moving forward in my career.

tldr: I was terminated. I did nothing wrong and have no negative evals or disciplinary action. To the best of my knowledge, they are not planning on filling my position."

I noticed one caretaker (let's call her Jessie) kept placing plates in without dumping the trash and food. I reminded her to do so, and she asked, ""are you trying to lecture me?"" I thought she was kidding with me and we were exchanging banter, so in a singsong voice, I said, ""yes ma'am!"" Well. Apparently we weren't.

I questioned it at first, I wasn't sure what just happened. Was she mad? A bit later, a few residents came into the kitchen to ask me for help (dessert, meds, etc) and that's the caretakers' job, not mine, so I looked in the dining area, but I found not a caretaker in sight. I also saw dishes everywhere. This has never happened before. Seemingly, all the caretaker girls left me to finish their work. Eventually one of them walked in and I mentioned the dishes but she said nothing and left. Later, another caretaker came through the kitchen and I asked about the dishes. She said that Jessie had told her to leave the dishes where they were, but that she would clean them up for me. She did so. I thanked her. We had pleasant conversation. Later, I came to clean the dining area, and saw a couple new stacks of plates/bowls, etc. The residents leave dishes in random spots so usually caretakers bring them in the kitchen even after mealtimes... Except tonight. 
Tonight they passive aggressively get left in the dining room. The sole resident who sat in the room said, ""rough night? I don't know why she left that there,"" implying that a caretaker did this, instead of walking 10 feet to the kitchen. Jessie (who is almost twice my age) managed to organize a walkout of sorts against me. How did she get them on her side? I didn't do anything with bad intent.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics go further and say the median pay in my field should be roughly 33-38k.

My current position pays me $13.70 an hour, $28,499 a year roughly, and I requested a salary adjustment at the end of my performance evaluation about a month ago.

&#x200B;

I am in a situation where I have been reported by some people in the division I work in for ""aggressive behavior"" to their manager as well as another manager. The manager of those two people wrote an email complaint to my manager regarding the situation. So far, my manager has been supportive of me, but has encouraged me to interact as little as possible with the two who reported me and to go through him if I need any work from or any collaboration with those two. I believe this is a good move. 

I have always been mindful of my manners and I try to speak as politely as possible and I always make sure my hands are down (or behind my back), that I keep appropriate personal space/distance etc. However, I am quite low on the ""totem pole"" here and thus I have to depend on a lot of people to do things for me because I do not have the authorization to do a lot of things I need to do for my work. I believe the complaints may have been motivated due to my low rank and my repeated requests for help with tasks. I have always understood that my requests of them can be annoying due to the volume and frequency, but because of that I've made sure to be super nice about it.

However, based on what my manager told me about the nature of those complaints, I suspect that formal complaints have already been made to my company's human resources. My manager told me he wasn't given the full story regarding the complaints from the other manager, but did mention the word ""aggressive"" was used to describe me and that the complaint mentioned unspecified corroborators attesting that I had acted with such behavior.

Given this situation, I would like to ask a few questions - first, is there anything in this situation that's a red flag that I need to be aware of and start documenting immediately? Second, should I start visiting human resources in order to create a record of my actions in order to document that I have been being polite and mannerly and decent the best I can? And third, am I overthinking when I suspect that those people and their unnamed corroborators are likely trying to build a case to terminate me?

They have remodelled their variable pay conditions. They would be paying it out  100% of variable pay in the year end only if average utilization of all quarters is above 90% or else nothing. So let's say I have utilization of 100% in the first three quarters but 60% in the last. I won't be paid out because average utilization falls below 90%. 

Seems fine at that but now utilization is strictly counted only when you are on a client project or at maximum preparing for one. 
It's been over a month that I have joined the company and haven't been assigned to any client project. I am told to learn xyz, because there is a possibility that project may come up. But it still won't be counted as utilization. So I have already lost utilization here in my first month that will affect my current quarter and eventually no variable pay in the end.

[Ontario] Midway through a certificate in HRM - When to tell my employer?,AskHR,3,d3683t,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d3683t/ontario_midway_through_a_certificate_in_hrm_when/,2,1568314938.0,"Hello all,

**Background:** I have a background in academics but after some negative experiences was unwilling to work in my field. I work in customer service at a mid-sized company where most of my skills are not fully used. Back when I was an academic, I tried my hand in HR and found that I enjoyed it, so I'm currently midway through a certificate in HRM in hopes of getting hired on in our company's HR department. This scenario takes place in Canada. I'm also going to become a father in January, and am planning on taking two months of parental leave in order to help out my wife in this new time.

**Workplace Relations:** I feel that I am a solid employee, personable & have no infractions, have received numerous cross-training opportunities, and am currently full-time. My immediate supervisor is very supportive of internal promotion, and has supported me in applying for a new position (that I did not get) in the past eight months.

**My question:** When should I officially reveal that I'm pursuing this certificate? Especially in light of the irony that about two weeks after I write the final exam, I'll become a father and go on paternity leave for two months? Do I let them know early, risking that they'll forget about me? Or do I let them know later on, when I can realistically say, or demonstrate that I've nearly crossed the finish line?

One thought that I had was to reach out to HR for an informational interview, to get an idea of what the culture is like in that office, and to also let them know that I'm interested. If they indicate that they're a closed shop, or that they'd love to hear more once I'm done, I guess that I'd get my answer.

**TL;DR** Soon-to-be dad halfway done an HR certificate - when/how I do tell my employer, especially if I'd like to work in HRM with them?"

I am absolutely willing and fully intend to put in the extra hours before hand to ensure things are set up and can go as smoothly as possible for my team while I am gone, and spend the extra time catching up when I get back.

I‚Äôm just unsure of how to go about this. It is somewhat bad timing having just started this new position, I have debated whether or not to go on the trip at all. But I have decided that I am going as I know I will truly regret it for the rest of my life if don‚Äôt.

Yesterday it seemed they found the right place, so he applied for it. From what I‚Äôve been told, the landlords denied his application because his wife‚Äôs credit wasn‚Äôt strong enough. (Evidently everyone over 18 has to fill out a credit app)

"Abuse of ""Exempt"" status and ""Work Week Adjustment""",AskHR,2,d2z2x7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d2z2x7/abuse_of_exempt_status_and_work_week_adjustment/,8,1568273549.0,"I work in Washington State, USA in an agency that is parallel to public sector, but is not exactly public sector. It's a weird industry that is legislatively created, but functions like a private company in most respects.

My colleagues and I are exempt, but we are contracted for only a specific number of ""days"" a year. On a work day, we are expected to work 8-4:30 in the office (so keeping regular business hours). But our work frequently takes us out of the office to sites that are far from the office and that therefore require us to work (9-10 hour days).  

Our agency tells us that ""anything over 10 hours"" can be work week adjusted in that same week. But there are some caveats:

1. WWA's are not a 1:1 ratio   
So a 10-hour day doesn't qualify for WWA. And a 12-hour day does not entitle us to 4 hours of WWA time.
2. We don't know what the ratio is -- or should be  
It's left up to the discretion of our department supervisor
3. We cannot bank these WWA hours in a week  
So three to five 10-12 hour days does **not** entitle us to 10-20 hours of WWA time
4. We must get approval for the WWA before it goes on the calendar in that same week  
But often times we cannot predict how long we will be at a remote site and the weeks do not allow for us to make a WWA in that week due to our schedules

In all, the policies completely benefit the agency and expect us to donate 10+ hours or work a week to our agency. 

To us, this sounds suspiciously one-sided from the agency. Not quite illegal, but certainly not policies in good faith looking out for their employees. But... we don't really know that. We just feel taken advantage of.

Does anyone have any advice or perspective on this? We feel that we are treated like hourly employees on the front end, but like exempt employees on the back end.

Company policy is no one should be at work with a communally disease. Examples.. flu,pinkeye,strep anything that is considered contagious. This policy absolutely makes sense considering that production workers are around food to be packaged.
Ok so now here is the crappy part. Our attendance policy. The hourly employees are on a point system.We do not have sick days. We have PTO that has to be approved beforehand by supervisors. So if you wake up before your shift and are sick as a dog you can not call in for a vacation day. You would have to call in to take a point. We can not get vacation days approved the day of over the phone.But here is the kicker. If you call off for being sick you will get a point and they will also take vacation day. Now sometimes you can go into work while sick and requests a vacation day. If the supervisors have enough staff they can approve the day and let you go home unpointed. But our company is usually understaffed and most often times the vacation day will be denied. Coworkers and myself included have been denied vacation days while running fevers and throwing up. But if you decide that you just cant be there because you are absolutely miserable and tell them you are leaving you will be pointed. They will also still take your vacation time from you that was denied and give you a point. To sum this all up.
You get double punishment for being sick and by their policy shouldn't be there anyway. People will come to work sick and spreading germs and making coworkers sick because they don't want to be pointed and lose a vacation day. It's a hot mess"

Set up and take down is expected to be an hour to an hour and a half. These will be 11-12 hour days outdoors working out of a tent and box truck.


Myself and my partner will be working the Saturday before the event (Sept. 28th) and have Sunday off (Sept. 29th). We will work Monday-Wednesday (Sept. 30- Oct. 2nd) at our warehouse/office location then leave for the event Thursday (Oct. 3rd). We will work from Thursday through to the following Wednesday (Oct 3rd-Oct 9th) when the next pair arrives. We will travel back Wednesday (Oct 9th) afternoon, then work Thursday thru Saturday (Oct 10th-Oct 12th) at the warehouse/office, totaling 13 days w/o a day off. Not only is it that 13 days, but we are working 6 day weeks the week before and the week after. The pair after us will be working similar, but at a 12 day stretch and no 6 day work weeks before or after.


Now we are all salaried employees and I'm fully aware of what that means. But am I in the wrong for asking to close on Columbus Day (it's our off season anyways) as a comp day? When I approached the owner about this the response I got was, ""Yes, there will be whining and welshing, but I don't ask for much from these people and I think I'm not asking a lot of them for this event. We have historically been open on Columbus Day and I'm not changing that just because of this, probably, one time event"". 

TL;DR - Being asked to work a 6 day week, followed by 13 days straight, then another 6 day week. 25 days of work with 2 days off on either end of the 13 day stretch."

"Wife is Possibly being Discriminated against, but she's white.",AskHR,4,d2tcjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d2tcjw/wife_is_possibly_being_discriminated_against_but/,12,1568250167.0,"Texas is the location.

My wife has been working at her company for 6+ years, and is a degreed professional with a Masters in her field, and the job is in her field. About 2 years ago, her then-boss quit and advised her to leave the company because it was turning toxic. He moved to Maine from Texas. We really don't have that option due to aging parents in this area that we aren't willing to leave.

Anyway, last December, she's been on 3rd shift for 3+ of those years, and is the lead in the night shift. She commonly works with part time workers and has another worker full time who covers the days she doesn't work, with a two day overlap. He's Filipino. He was engaging in back-talking another colleague in my wife's presence to another colleague, and she pulled him aside and let him know that wasn't appropriate.  He got really wierdly angry and it blew up into a whole thing, ending with my wife being uncomfortable working with him. She went to her manager, a black woman. This seems to have been a real mistake. She had to go through a real mess, and at the end was told that it didn't rise to the level of harassment, and to not even try go against the company, because she'd lose. HR wasn't brought in to this.

This seems to have been the beginning. Since then, she's been harassed by her boss, who has called her in the middle of the morning (When she knows my wife sleeps) and woken her over trivial matters. She's also waited until right before my wife has started her weekend to bring up things that almost seem like they're designed to upset my wife.

Then a trend started. The manager started hiring only middle aged black men, who were balding. It's like she found a type. Since my wife has had her manager, there have been only POC hired in that department, and the vast majority are black men. The racial makeup of this area of Texas is about 15% African American, and about 50% white, by the way, yet the only people who seem to get hired are from a relatively small pool. One of these men apparently didn't like the way my wife worked with him. According to her, he's very bad at paperwork, and it could end up being a legal issue if he screws it up. He's also fond of leaving jobs for her to pick up that he should have taken care of. She dealt with the jobs part, but required that he properly complete the paperwork. He got mad, and made an HR complaint. In the HR meeting, he called her a racist. She got really mad and called him a sexist, and it went back and forth. This really hurt my wife, and things got even worse at work for her. The man eventually made amends with her and told her that he didn't realize that management would escalate his complaint to such a level. They're OK now, but not great. Her boss then informed her that she probably had enough of a case to fire my wife. Of course, this was verbal, and only the two of them in the room.

My wife had a meeting with her manager, and her manager's manager (A white man). The dude told my wife that they would be getting her a new manager, to see if they could work better with her. This never happened, and when my wife met with him and brought it up, he back-tracked, so in the end, it was an empty promise. She's taken to printing out emails, because the company has a 3 month email retention policy.

About a month ago, my wife's boss gave her a satisfactory review. Yet no interview for that position. Her boss verbally told her that it was a matter of ""when"" she would be moved to days, but in the past has only offered her a day job in exchange for taking a demotion. By the way, her boss has told her that she uses ""sharp tones"" and should soften her voice when talking to others. My wife was very offended by this.

Today, my wife was passed over for a day time job in favor of a black woman who not only doesn't have the experience or credentials my wife has, but also hasn't been in her current position long enough to satisfy company policy for that move. My wife didn't even get an interview for this position. She's tired, feels paralyzed, and despondent, and doesn't have much fight left in her. She also recently got into a car accident (Other driver's fault according to the police report and witnesses) and totaled her car driving in to work at night. She's anxious, afraid to drive because of this, and hurting both physically and emotionally.

So, beyond simply quitting, any suggestions? I feel like this has gone far past any reconciliation between her boss, and I honestly think that race-based favoritism is in play. I also think that my wife has been the subject of a hostile work environment, and retaliation. But her boss is a protected class, and I don't know what to do about this. That's why I posted this wall of text.

Edit: Forgot to mention that jobs are really scarce in her field right now."

Conflict during the process of resigning,AskHR,3,d2lwyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d2lwyl/conflict_during_the_process_of_resigning/,7,1568212628.0,"I apologize for posting a second time so quickly, but I think this is a separate question than the first post and I'm honestly at a bit of a loss. 

I resigned my position and gave two weeks notice last tuesday. I wrote a formal letter and sent it to the local management. I should have sent it to HR, but I have been making strategic mistakes like it's my profession. 

I was in and out during last week dealing with, well, myself really, and the mental health fall out of this job. Part of that have been a few incidents that were particularly problematic. But i was in the office finishing and packing up my office. 

Over the weekend, after five anyway, one of the people in charge started texted me in a panic about what was going on. She never comes into the office, so I hadn't seen her in weeks. Still haven't. I should also add that she was one of the recipients of my resignation letter, and she responded to acknowledge receipt.

On Monday, our HR rep from the main office, out of state, called to say the people in charge told her I just stopped showing up and they didn't know why. I explained I had sent out a formal letter and was under the impression she was aware. She wasn't. So I forwarded both the resignation email to her, and the email acknowledging receipt. 

That was this morning. A few hours later my account was disabled as I worked, and it kicked me off finishing my last few projects. Then a few hours after that, at 10 pm, I got a text message that I shouldn't bother coming back, I was done. 

Which is fine, except, as the stupidest person on Earth, I hadn't finished retrieving certain emails (like when I asked to meet with the management for a required performance review and they blew me off). I grabbed hardcopies of some of my work, but this means I have absolutely no ability to influence this narrative, do I? How can I demonstrate I didn't just abandon this job? Or does it matter? Did I just get fired, after resigning, by a text message, at ten at night? Is that what this was?

I know there is a tendency to blame the person who left for any problems, and that's fine. I also made mistakes, and I acknowledge them. But I also know this place has been hemorrhaging employees, almost exclusively women, and the women who resigned before me made a lot of noise as they left (about hostile environments for example) and everyone got really on edge about this. 

I don't really know what I can do to protect myself from retaliation, or other ways of damaging my career. I've never been in a situation like this before, and any advice on protecting myself/moving on is much appreciated, thank you."
How to deal with an underperforming employee?,AskHR,32,d2c0m7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d2c0m7/how_to_deal_with_an_underperforming_employee/,16,1568169166.0,"US- NY

Not sure if this is the best subreddit, but here goes. I‚Äôve been working at my current job for a little over a year now. I was the first person to start a new sub-department within my branch‚Äôs engineering department. Within a month of starting, I had improved relationships with a few clients drastically, and I generally learned the job very quickly. My superiors were impressed and continue to praise me for a job well done. About 6 months after I started, we hired a second person (aside from me) in my sub-department. Although he and I report to the same boss, I am responsible for training this new person and giving him tasks, as I am in a sense considered the head of this sub-department. 

Now this is my first job, and although I have some experience in leadership, I‚Äôm definitely not experienced in training new employees. I did my best, but this guy seems to have a really difficult time grasping basic concepts. I thought I wasn‚Äôt explaining it well, but when others in the engineering department stepped in to help on a big job, they picked up what I was saying right away, and executed all tasks with zero mistakes. 

The biggest issue I‚Äôm having with this employee is that he makes a multitude of mistakes. Every time I double check his work I find at least three glaring issues. There are many things we have to be aware of when designing something, and he just completely forgets about several of the important steps. I‚Äôve tried remedying this by pointing out the errors he makes continuously and saying something like, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really important we don‚Äôt make these mistakes. I‚Äôd rather things take longer than expected but be done right, than have you blow through them and miss important factors.‚Äù But nothing changes. He‚Äôs been working here for 7 months now. 

I‚Äôm not saying I don‚Äôt make mistakes, but usually they‚Äôre nowhere near this drastic. He just doesn‚Äôt seem to double check work or really analyze things closely. He also nearly falls asleep whenever I explain things to him. He just seems out of it 24/7. 

I need to know how to proceed. I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs time I sit down with my boss and explain the issues I‚Äôm having, but I‚Äôm worried it‚Äôll look badly on me, as maybe my boss will think I‚Äôve done a poor job training him. I‚Äôm also worried I‚Äôll get him in trouble or make things uncomfortable. I‚Äôm not a confrontational person, so I just feel bad. I‚Äôll feel like I‚Äôm tattling on him or something. Is there something else I can do before going to my boss? We work in an open office environment, so I never have privacy to sit him down and explain to him what I‚Äôve written above.

Hi all, not sure if I‚Äôm posting in the right place. Please feel free to point me in the right direction if not. 

I worked for a large company from 2014-2015. I resigned due to a promotion and relocation. My record was perfect. I applied again in September 2018 and was hired. Unfortunately, my daughter was diagnosed with an illness that required hospitalization about 2 weeks after I was hired. I communicated this to my manager at the time. She said she checked with HR and due to the circumstances, my ability to be rehired would not be affected. I wrote the date that she asked me to put on the resignation, turned in my equipment and that was the end of it. 

Almost a year later, I applied for another position within the company. A recruiter contacted me and told me I was not eligible for rehire. I contacted my old manager and she was rude and dismissive and said she was too busy to talk to me. I contacted Employee Relations and I finally receive an email today (almost 3 weeks later) from the HR director saying that the eligibility decision stands and is correct due to ‚Äúother factors‚Äù which he is not at liberty to discuss with me.

I‚Äôm sorry, that was long winded. But is there any way to appeal that decision and can they really not tell me what ‚Äúother factors‚Äù contributed to their decision?  Thanks for any insight."

"Would a double major in Business Administration/Communications be more valuable in HR than a degree in Psychology with ""HR Emphasis""?",AskHR,2,d2heqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d2heqq/would_a_double_major_in_business/,3,1568190205.0,"US - KY

Hello!

I am a sophomore in college and considering pursuing a career in human resources. Originally I thought that a double major in Business Administration and Communications would be a smart route, but then I learned my college offers a psychology degree specifically catered towards human resources.  I still feel that a degree in BA/COMM would look better on a resume and keep my doors open, whereas a degree in PSYC would severely limit those aforementioned doors. Also the ""HR Emphasis"" is really just a fancy way of saying that it is the same general PSYC courses with an HR Elective tacked on in senior year, and a Business Law course thrown in.

Any advice on this?

(NOTE: I do intend to intern in HR during Junior/Senior year and begin studying for the SHRM-CP as soon as I graduate. I just would like to know which courses/degrees would look better on the resume and do a better job of preparing me for a career in HR.)"

Today, my office was paid a surprise visit by the CTO and CEO to announce that our team (IT, QA, Development) were being transitioned to other global regions of the company over the next 6-9 months. 

We were presented with severance agreements and at the end of the agreement was a table of the positions, the age of the person in the position, and whether they were being kept or not. 

In short, there was a single position from our office being kept. That isn't so much an issue to me as the fact that the company listed the age of each individual as part of the document reconciling the transition of the positions.

This document has a column denoting position, age, and whether they were being kept. With my limited knowledge, I was absolutely stunned over the fact that ages were presented in this document since we have less than 20 people in this office and everything can be easily reconciled to an individual 

Why would a company reference age in this situation? Despite the fact we are globally headquartered in the UK, the company is subject to employment law in every country in which they choose to do business.

Would this not potentially open the door to some type of age discrimination despite the fact of the mostly universal impact? It appears no one is targeted because of age but I am stunned that they provided that degree of information.

Almost all workplace I had worked, supervisors including their boss. co-workers, and now Human Resource mention something about my fine thin hair growth. I get blunt comments and questions to a more (trying) be aware...such as What's that hair by your ear and face? Are you gonna wax it? Have you thought about laser hair removal? Could you afford wax? Have you used tweezers? Are you trying to become a Man? Are you a trans? Did you know as you age, hormones make you more hairy? There were times, I was bullied. I've asked through PCOS subreddit that women are not needed to reveal, but I want the HR view on this.

I knew little about PCOS until few nurses told mentioned it to me in 2014 or 2015. I have light skin complexity and natural black hair color. The hair long my small ears is absolutely normal from what I had seen on people. I have tiny fine hair growth from bottom of my lashes-down my cheek line-and partial on my jawline.  To make this a short post,

1. Are women expected to reveal their health condition that contributes to their professional appearance? Even if it's from a bit of excessive hair growth is manageable?
2. Is there anything held against us if women remain quiet AFTER the question has be verbally asked? (Even if it's an HR asking. Yes, HR was my interview in 2018 had asked me bluntly.)
3. Is joking back count as retaliation? Read paragraph below.

Edit small paragraph-At job orientation, the topic came next was professional look and hygiene after 15 minute break ended. Professional look and hygiene was delivered with some sense and hints that it was directed to me due to HR kept looking at me. During the aisle to watch video on an ipad and tour, I joked back about waiting at the cosmetics, HR reply as if she is irritated ""What is up with you and cosmetics?"" after HR asked ""where should we wait?"" A backfired joke? Sarcasm? HR did not seemingly to not be aware about PCOS.

Hi all,

Thank you for taking the time to read this.  My work life has recently taken a toll on me mentally.  We are short staffed and I am expected to do 2x more work than I should be and when I asked for a raise to compensate I was shot down.  Afterwards a manager begged me to stay because they would be... well, not in a good place without me as I am the top producer and do the most work.  I decided it was finally time for a change as my mental health should be priority over catering to my boss. 

I have been interested in Human Resources for a long time.  I enjoy fixing problems and helping people with complex tasks.  Moreover I am incredibly good at being non biased and working with sensitive information.  I work in the banking sector so I deal with a lot of that kind of thing already, as well as keeping up with ever changing policies (federal, state, and bank specific). 

I completed college with a 3.6 GPA and competed in the national collegiate sales competition- I also have a certification in business to business selling.  My main degree is a BS in Business Administration.  The face to face sales life isn‚Äôt for me though, I interned at one and could not bring myself to swindle like that.

My problem is every HR position I apply for requires 2 or more years of experience in HR.  I have justified why parts of my job encompass important aspects of HR, but have never gotten past this roadblock.  Keep in mind these are all entry level positions.  I have reached out to recruiters and HR representatives and am always told to ‚Äúkeep applying for entry levels to gain experience.‚Äù

My question for you lovely people is how does one go about getting this experience?  I have been told by people within the company (I work with a lot of different people through work but cannot use them as it would be unprofessional and I could get in trouble) that I have to know someone to attain a job.  I know this is very true, but I cannot seem to ever find an HR representative interested in giving me more than a generic answer.  It‚Äôs understandable, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but I just want a fair chance.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I currently work at a bank, working with hundreds of different clients as well as having loan quotas.  I also mentor the position below me and am now currently expected to help train and assist in the two new hires of my position.  I also have mentored two of my coworkers into getting jobs or promotions within my company.  I have been here over two years and been promoted twice, but do not wish to stay in this industry.  I will answer questions on why I am unhappy with my current job if that would help.

Thank you for reading this far if you have!"

I'm a professional at a professional services firm. As part of my job duties, I supervise, mentor, and train younger professionals in the trade, but I have very little HR or management training myself.

Recently my firm fired a younger professional (YP) for attendance problems, as well as for the professional giving inconsistent  information as to the reason for not attending work. I hesitate to accuse by calling it ""lying,"" but maybe ""dissembling?"" Let's just say some people were told one thing, and others another, in writing. There were additional problems with completing required education/licensing/classes, and this person was also caught loafing on the job.

I've since been contacted by this professional, asking to serve as a reference who could attest to YP's job duties. While I will contact my HR for their guidance on this, I would like to ask you guys for your opinions so I can go in with some context as to what's normal or customary for someone in my situation.

Is it normal for a fired person to contact their direct for a reference? And if so, what would be the customary or appropriate thing to do?

I don't think I can give YP a positive reference, and I don't want to besmirch YP to others. I would like to just ignore the request, but I disagree with cowardliness, and ignoring the request would be cowardly. I frankly wish I had never been asked.

"Who ""owns"" unused transportation benefits? (Washington D.C.)",AskHR,2,d2cb5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d2cb5h/who_owns_unused_transportation_benefits/,2,1568170271.0,"Our company offers employees a choice of either paid parking or $140/month in Metro (our subway/bus system) benefits, and employees are allowed to switch between the two as their circumstances change.  For instance, we have one employee who drives (gets parking) during the school year but switches to Metro for the summer months.  Most metro benefits roll over from month to month (so unused funds stay on their account).

Since the metro fare is based on distance, some employees use all of their metro benefits each month while others (those who live closer to work) use only a fraction of that $140.  We also have employees who travel extensively for work,  or who carpool with a spouse, so they don't use very much of their metro benefits.  As a result, we have quite a few employees who are carrying a *very* high credit balance on their metro account ($750-$1200).  We currently have about $15K sitting in unused employee ""rollover"" funds.

The discussion has come up about those rollover funds being returned to the company after a certain amount of time, OR the benefits being put ""on hold"" until their balances are down below $500 (about 4 month's worth).   The question has come up about who really owns those benefits and whether or not they can be ""suspended"" if the amount gets too high.  According to Metro, ""Rollover allows unused benefits to accumulate in the associated SmarTrip¬Æ account of the employee up to $4,045"" but does ""allows"" mean that the employer HAS to allow them to accumulate, or that they MAY allow them to accumulate?  

One of our VPs argues that the money belongs to the company, another VP (who happens to have a high credit on their metro account right now) argues that it's a benefit to the employees and once it's in their metro account, it belongs to them."

My resume includes my volunteer experience at schools as I was pursuing my degree, I‚Äôve passed police background checks to do work with our Open Door Society, and I‚Äôve given English tutoring to recent immigrants and refugees. I‚Äôm an ally to the Islamic community in my city, and I occasionally call out problematic (racist) people in Facebook comment threads.

An old coworker/Facebook friend of mine said that she put in a ‚Äúheavily worded‚Äù recommendation for me, and she‚Äôs actually the wife of one of the founders of this company. She told me she‚Äôd never advocated for someone so hard, and jokingly said ‚Äúplease deliver‚Äù if I got an interview. She said I‚Äôd left an impression on her when we shared an office space and I was mentoring/supervising some summer university students working in our department (university facilities management) for the summer. 

I thanked her profusely because this all came as a surprise to me, and I‚Äôd only mentioned I‚Äôd applied to the job last week, with no talk about a recommendation. Things seemed positive, until late the other night I got a Facebook message from her, informing me that she‚Äôd just heard back and doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be contacted for an interview... ‚Äúthey did a little research, as most potential employers do and felt that some of your posts were not a cultural fit for their brand.‚Äù

She then pointed out a Facebook post from a year ago, in which I called out Saudi Arabia for its shameful anti-Canada policy and laughably offensive 9/11-esque meme they endorsed during the height of tensions between us; and one other post where I share a link to a hilariously obtuse propaganda rap video that the Chinese Communist Party commissioned to celebrate ‚ÄúTwo Sessions‚Äù ‚Äî https://youtu.be/5OT1Re6GrSg

These were the two posts she believes they may have been referring to (though I understand that she doesn‚Äôt speak for the company, and couldn‚Äôt confirm what they saw or discussed before making their decision)

I sometimes make political commentaries on my Facebook wall, but I don‚Äôt feel that I‚Äôve ever crossed a line. Granted, I‚Äôm not kind when responding to fascist regimes‚Äô cheap shots at Canada or explaining why the Communist Party of China has no business censoring hip-hop while co-opting the genre for its propaganda. All of my posts had been public so that they could be shared ‚Äî they never got much traction outside my friends list, and my own progressive, tech-literate grandmother even ‚Äúliked‚Äù these posts and discusses these political issues with me regularly. 

**I‚Äôve since switched my entire Facebook page and all posts to private, and made sure everything‚Äôs squeaky clean for the next social media background check.** What else should I do? Is this a blacklisting, or should I apply again in the future? Should I follow up, or ask for feedback on my application? Apologize and ask what I can do to bring my online presence up to their standard?

I understand these social media background checks are ubiquitous enough, especially in the tech sector, but I‚Äôm struggling to see how they don‚Äôt constitute pre-judging a candidate on all sorts of supposedly protected information, and all the things that an employer isn‚Äôt legally allowed to ask an applicant:

(an article on McMillan.ca from 2013)
‚Äúin all Canadian jurisdictions, social media searches increase the risk of human rights complaints. Human rights legislation across the country prohibits discrimination on the basis of characteristics such as: social condition, source of income, political beliefs, criminal conviction, mental or physical disability (including drug/alcohol addiction), family status, marital status, gender identity/expression, sexual orientation, pregnancy/childbirth, sex/gender, age, religion/creed, nationality/citizenship, national/ethnic/place of origin, ancestry, and race/colour.

A social media search has a high probability of revealing information about one or more of these protected characteristics. If a candidate is not hired after this type of information has been collected, the candidate could allege that the organization's decision to refuse employment was based, at least in part, on the protected characteristic. Even if the allegation is false, the organization will be put into the position of having to defend its decision, as well as incurring the costs and inconveniences of defending against a human rights complaint.‚Äù

So since a person can be screened entirely from the interview process based on a social media check, are we not treading dangerously close to allowing prejudice in the hiring process? Also, is being called a bad ‚Äúcultural fit‚Äù not a bit of a loaded term? Anyway, thanks for reading! Any advice is much appreciated."
Question about a pay raise,AskHR,1,d2d2bw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d2d2bw/question_about_a_pay_raise/,11,1568173066.0,"Colorado, USA

At the start of last month, my 2 year anniversary came up. So I talked with my manager about a pay raise, and he agreed to a 7.5% pay raise, not the 10-15 I was asking for. I've been patiently waiting to see my paychecks go up and just got an email today from my manager that it finally went through. It did also contain a few things I'm not sure he meant to provide to me, such as:

Request Date:  08/29/2019 

Effective Date: 09/08/2019. 

Retro Payments Needed? No 

We talked on the 2nd. He didn't submit the increase until the end of the month? And then it was only approved 1.5 weeks later? I'm sure it takes a minute for HR to do paperwork or whatever. But seems unfair my manager waited so long after to do this raise. During this in-between of us taking & me finally getting my raise, I had been working OT hours which a pay raise would have definitely helped out even more. As of 9/1 I'm no longer working OT. I wonder if he was waiting until I stopped this OT to save the company money or something?

In any event, would I be out of line asking HR directly about getting retro pay?  Or what's a kosher way of saying to my boss, I feel like you screwed me out of my pay increase.

During my ACLS class, I noticed I was surrounded by only critical care nurses. I am NOT a critical care nurse. One of the nurses even commented, ""do they require all nurses to do ACLS now?"". With that, I emailed my manager, and replied that **I am not required to have ACLS**.

Although the class was very informative, I feel cheated that I had to spend my own money ($250) and time (2 hour drive), for a certification I did not need. I'm working with a healthy population, and it would be VERY rare for me to use ACLS while on the floor. I'm positive that none of the other nurses on my unit is ACLS certified.

I ask because its been about 2 weeks since I applied to this job in Phoenix and have not been contacted by HR/Recruitment yet. For reference, I work in a very niche field where it is very very difficult to find qualified candidates. The company I applied to in Phoenix is a Fortune 500, if that matters.

Basically like the title says. I work for a major government in the state of Washington. Have a college degree from local flagship college. Got hired as intern out of college, did that for a year. Unemployed for three months, got hired again in Building Management as an admin spec, and have work here for about 2.5 years as an admin spec, then promoted to fiscal spec. Have been a temporary employee since April 2017. 

Was moved to finance when no training led to multiple errors and my new supervisor and I never really got along. If it matters, shes eastern european and never really seemed to give me a chance. I received zero training for my current role and through plenty of mistakes turned it around and am now doing well in my current position for the past 6 months. 

SO we're clear, everyone on our team dislikes her, and enjoys me, as shes has only been with the team 6 months longer than I have, and our dept manager is also a minority female known for only hiring minorities that can do her job for her. I've never had a direct issue with her and the last we spoke she called me and my supervisor into a meeting last week to tell me I will not be extended. I simply said, ""is that it?"" I didnt really know what to say and I didnt want to give my supervisor the satisfaction of knowing she affected my attitude toward my job in anyway. 

Asked for more work 6 months ago, got told I made 1 mistake 6 weeks ago so I shouldn't have more responsibilities. Tried asking for more work from others in my team, but a new career term employee got the tasks. Continually got show down for more responsibility and started having 1-on-1 meetings every month or two, always seemed to follow after I made a mistake. Was never supported by my boss, only being told why I can understand some concepts. 

I see my job come up for hire as career service, basically every duty of mine expect for payroll. I apply, get awarded an interview...within the exact five days I have vacation. My only vacation I've taken in 1.5 years. 

After interview and test, supervisor says 'you're just not a good fit'. Thats it. I ask to job shadow with a different department, she then tells me ""you should've done this earlier, its just common sense."" Thanks

Should I do as good a job as I can and continue to apply for jobs in the same government, OR SHOULD I ASSUME MY SUPERVISOR WILL NOT GIVE ME A GOOD REVIEW? I applied for a job this weekend with the same government, but 4-6 weeks. Should I get a part-time service job or does a resume gap look better? What questions should I be asking here?

Partner suspended from job without warning - what to do next?,AskHR,4,d1u518,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d1u518/partner_suspended_from_job_without_warning_what/,7,1568079409.0,"I'm located in the greater Los Angeles area. Last week, my partner told me that he had been suspended without pay from his job. He works for a large independent retailer and manages the warranty department. He supervises one employee. When I asked him why he got suspended, he said that the higher-ups said that his department wasn‚Äôt working efficiently enough. Before his suspension, there were no warnings from executives about this. They just went straight to suspension. They were going to suspend his subordinate as well, but my partner told executives that his employee needed to stay and, if anyone was going to be punished, punish him and not the lower-level employee.¬†

My partner was not given a day to return to work. He‚Äôs in a weird middle state where he‚Äôs not unemployed, but he‚Äôs also not being paid. I‚Äôve asked him if his employer has an employee handbook that outlines disciplinary procedures, and he said there must be one but he doesn‚Äôt know where to find it.¬†

I‚Äôve done some rudimentary reading, and have learned that a lot about suspensions depend on whether the employee is exempt or non-exempt. My partner is paid hourly, but he‚Äôs also eligible for overtime pay. Does that make him exempt? I also read that suspension qualifies as a separation from work, which would allow him to file for unemployment. Is this true?¬†

I‚Äôm mainly just confused. My partner seems like he just wants to wait the suspension out‚Äîbut he has no idea how long it could last, and seeing as he‚Äôs not getting paid, he won‚Äôt be able to make rent or pay for any other expenses. I‚Äôm a person who always wants to fix things by nature, so I‚Äôm trying to figure out what he should do. Should he reach out to his HR person? Should he file for unemployment? I know that he‚Äôs already applied for other jobs, but in the past, he has not been quick to find new sources of income.¬†

Mainly, I have a few questions:

1. Is it normal for companies to suspend employees‚Äîand not provide a date for return‚Äîwithout first providing a warning to an employee? For me, this kind of felt out of the blue.¬†
2. What are the smartest next steps?¬†

TLDR; Partner was suspended from work without warning or pay, clueless about what to do next.¬†"

Initializing Event (January 2019 ): Our monthly board meeting (on a Friday) was interrupted by a man, call him 'Manny', who entered the wrong door. Our CEO brought him out to the front because he was looking for 'Lisa' and CEO assumed he was a member who had been poorly directed. Lisa and Manny have some confusion and their voices start rising until I can tell that Lisa is getting upset. I stand up to see if I can lend support or go get a manager. Manny storms out the door, Lisa follows. Two other coworkers and myself go through the office to the side door. I feel confusion and concern for my coworker friend.

Immediately, the conversation between Lisa and Manny becomes heated. He is accusing her of obstruction. She is initially confused, and then tries to explain where he misunderstood her, and then is getting visibly upset: shaking, red face, choked up. Most other coworkers go inside. I've figured out the issue is Manny wants to look at Lisa's vehicle and is refusing to show authorization to do so. Lisa is very distraught and then starts to rise to Manny's level of hostility. I'm afraid that Manny will do something to Lisa initially and then I'm just afraid that they'll start fighting each other.

I step in, ask to see his identification, ask the reason for his visit to our WORKPLACE, and inform him that he is disrupting our business and needs to leave. Lisa is yelling at him, he's yelling back. I get a photo of his ""work ID"" which is on his phone. Lisa gives permission for photos of the outside of her car to be taken. Manny is cussing her out, calling her names. I stand there until he is done and tell him he needs to leave. He pushes for more photos. Lisa starts getting hysterical. I tell him I will be calling security if he doesn't leave our property immediately. He leaves after calling her more names.

I called his company to file a formal complaint about his behavior. I used OUR COMPANY NAME in that report. The next workday, I went to our CEO to let her know that I had filed a complaint about the man. She was completely in the dark about what happened and pressed me for a whole rundown. I did the best I could to give ""just the facts"". She was concerned that no one had told her. When we were done, I tried to tell Lisa that she should give her own information of the events to the CEO. She didn't want to. Later the CEO talked to her.

Since then, Lisa has been either cold or openly hostile to me. She was supposed to teach me a process, she kept ""not having time"" and doing it herself. She told my manager that \*I\* was the one not making time. I had take the task from her and learn it on the fly. She's engaged in gossip with several people about how terrible I am, how fake I am, and how lazy I am. She has access to our out@ emails for requesting time off and was derisive when I lost a pet I'd had for 2/3rd of my life and took time off. She's filed false reports that I was working on personal projects during a time when everyone was VERY busy at work. I've seen several emails in passing that were clearing talking about me but weren't TOO me (people leave things up on their screens in this office and I work in IT and sometimes emails come in while I'm working on their computer - I do NOT SNOOP in people's emails, that would be abusing my access power).

I am SO TIRED of the gossip. I'm tired of feeling like people are watching me, talking about me. I feel like Lisa is still punishing me for what happened in January - taking her ""personal troubles"" to management. I think I acted correctly once I had made the complaint call. If I was presented with the same situation today, I might decide to stay inside and protect MYSELF instead of support someone I thought was a friend.   
I don't know how to approach a mediation attempt. I think she is just as likely to deny any hard feelings and I have no proof. I'm afraid that if I try for mediation, she'll just double down on talking about me to her group of 3-4 people and things will just get worse for me.

TLDR: At the beginning of the year, I brought information to our CEO about an event on company property. A coworker is mad about it and hasn't ""forgiven"" me - is gossiping (mostly via email) and filing false complaints. Should I attempt mediation?

What is the correct way to approach this situation?"

"Sales Engineer (Energy/Utilities) Income Expectations (Houston, TX)",AskHR,2,d1r6n9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d1r6n9/sales_engineer_energyutilities_income/,2,1568065933.0,"Hello, All.

First, thanks for any input and if there are better subreddits to post this in, please let me know.

I'm an Electrical Design Engineer for an Engineering/Procurement/Construction firm (mainly focusing on substations) considering a transition into a Sales Engineer role within my current company. I would be switching from Engineering department to Sales. I would consider this a promotion considering the increased responsibility and the fact that I'd report directly to the VP of Sales in a 300+-person company. I've always had a greater interest in the business side of things and feel that I can create a solid career for myself by combining my technical knowledge with my previous sales experience. I graduated with my BSEE in 2017 and have 2+ years technical experience. Prior to pursuing my degree, I was a technical recruiter (engineering) for 2 years which heavily focused on sales, hence my confidence in this transition to SE and the company's interest in me for this role

My question pertains to salary, as the market for a role of this nature is very unclear. I know software SEs can make a great deal, often consisting of commission. This role is base+bonus (no commission). I have been unable to connect with anyone who is a SE in my industry who could provide better insight into compensation. I'm currently just under $100k base, receive a small annual bonus ($2000-3000), and feel that I am paid well in my current role considering my only 2+ years of experience post-graduation (my salary negotiation skills are strong via my experience as a recruiter). Articles I've read say not to hesitate to ask for a 10-20% raise when offered a promotion, but I also don't want to price myself out of this opportunity. Is coming in high asking for a \~$120k base risky? I'd realistically hope to receive a bump to $110k base but wouldn't want that to be the first number I put out, as it'd likely be countered at a lower figure. Any knowledge on a transition such as this would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks so much!"

HR Manager is DEFINITELY a racist,AskHR,51,d124s0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d124s0/hr_manager_is_definitely_a_racist/,22,1567921421.0,"So, I work at a local business with a huge range of employees. We're also in a city that has recently received a large influx of asylum seekers, mostly from African countries.

A month or so ago, we had a weird day where there were two people who came in off the street to inquire about a job. One of them was a white woman, the other was a Congolese migrant. Both were qualified and had their credentials and resumes with them. Our HR Manager interviewed the first one (the white lady), and she was hired on the spot. When I came in with the second person's information, HR saw that he was from the Congo and said, ""No. We don't hire people from the Congo. We've done it before and they've never shown up to work."" I was instructed to turn him away and throw his resume in the trash, even though we were hiring for the position to which he wanted to apply.

I'm cutting down my hours at this job, and we're looking for someone to replace me. We've had quite a few interviews this past week, but there aren't that many qualified candidates so the pool we're choosing from is quite small. We did interview one woman who was African, but we weren't sure where she was from (because it shouldn't matter). She speaks 3 languages, was very friendly and has a lot of experience in a position that's actually a step up from mine, so she'd definitely be able to do it. Right after we interviewed her, my HR Manager was very excited about her, but then as the week went on, we interviewed a white man who was nice and could probably do the job but would require special permission to hire due to an employment policy requirement that he didn't fill. I don't want to say what it is because it's quite specific to my company.

Despite the ordinarily disqualifying issue that the man had, my HR Manager was insistent that we hire him. We sat down to go over who we'd interviewed (I sat in on all the interviews and was able to ask questions), and HR was dead set on him. When I mentioned the other woman, this is the conversation we had verbatim: 

HR: ""Bad news, I found out she IS from the Congo."" 

Me: ""So? You can't just refuse to hire someone because of where they're from. Plus she has all that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ experience, and she's been in the US for like, 10 years.""

HR: ""Yeah, I guess, but WHY does she have SO many of those jobs? That's fishy.""

Me: ""I'm like 10 years younger than her and have had way more jobs. That's not a legitimate reason, either.""

HR: ""Yeah, okay, but I still have concerns. I mean, a lot of times, THEY just stop showing up to work.""

&#x200B;

So, you can see my concern. The Manager is the ENTIRE HR department in the company, and I know the Executive Director wouldn't listen seriously to my concerns because the ED and HR Manager are best friends. I could go directly to the owners of the company and say something, but I'm still going to be working there part-time and I don't want to burn a bridge because I still need the job."

After all this time, I earned other work experience, a bachelor's degree, and stronger work ethic. Thinking that would be enough to get back in with the company, Friend 'A' and Friend 'B' working there gave referrals into HR to review my resume. HR emailed me back simply stating that I was on the company's ""Do Not Hire"" list. Since Friend 'C' of our's got off that list, I requested to be removed as well.

Friend 'A' has been working closely with their program manager to help assist me with getting off the list. I found out today that I was put on the list because I left without notice. That isn't true and I can recall the day I was let go. I was escorted out by my team lead and an old HR rep at the time. I didn't really think much of it until today. Now, Friend 'C' got out of the list because he was being offered a job with a sister company and he was DNH with the parent company. I worry that because of the fact that things that aren't the truth got logged into their system, this could prevent me from finding other work that unbeknownst to me, can be governed by the parent company.

I can't even be 100% sure that this hasn't hurt me in other ways like it is entirely possible that I was barred from other jobs for ""lying"" on my resume about the history and nature of my dismissal. I'm past the point of hoping that said company would change their mind but the advice I'm seeking is simple. Is this even legal? No laws are being broken? No HR code of ethics are being violated? This whole thing just feels wrong because I never attempted to quit. I was young and never lost a job before (and still haven't besides this one) so I did try to reason with them in private the day I was dismissed but of course their mind was already made up. I laugh now at me trying to save the job but I'm not really laughing now that they have this whole thing propped up on a lie. 

How about any peaceful way to try to gain an audience and talk to them about it? I'm all ears, reddit. I'm having a hard time finding work so anything that might help me bury this hatchet.... it would be wonderful. Thanks in advice.

Edit - Hey everyone. It just dawned on me that I collected unemployment benefits after I was dismissed. I was under the impression that nobody that just quits could receive benefits. It seems like I would have had to schedule a hearing to appeal for benefits if i just simply quit without notice, or left after giving a 2 weeks for that matter. But I never had a hearing because that isn't how this whole thing went down. Dont know if this helps potential advice but I had to mention it."

And I know this may seem a bit clueless, but why am I putting money into a program that offers me unpaid time off? Is it help employee recuperate the cost of having to hire temps when full-time workers take leave? Everything I read online just talks in glowing terms about how you'll be able to take time off to have a baby, assist a loved one, and things like that- but nothing lays out a balanced ""pros and cons"" list of how this is going to affect the average employee. Can anyone help explain this to me? Thank you."
Is my ex-boss likely get fired for Sexual Harassment or not? NY,AskHR,1,d10tkm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d10tkm/is_my_exboss_likely_get_fired_for_sexual/,17,1567915158.0,"New York -I filed a demand letter with a lawyer against my former company claiming Sexual Harassment from my boss. He was the boss of a smaller group within a larger company. About 1.5 weeks after the demand letter was sent, a friend told me wasn't at the office for about a week and people were getting called up to meet with HR. I assume he was removed for the investigation during this time. My friend was then sent a litigation hold and I haven't heard from her or any other members of that group since this happened.

After he was gone for about 3 weeks, another coworker not on litigation hold told me he saw him in the office and he thinks he's working, but wasn't exactly sure because he doesn't work with that group and works on a different floor. I will have to wait and seeto find out why he's there and if he is in fact back working.

I did some shopping around for lawyers before hiring mine. I called 3 employment lawyers and they all were willing to help on a contingency basis and put the case up on legalmatch and had 3 views and 3 ""yes"" responses there, also on a contingency basis. I knew a lot of the instances would be he said/she said, but I had some emails as evidence too. I was pretty sure I had a strong case. It includes inappropriate remarks and conversations, unwelcome advances, and inappropriate touching.

I told my lawyer that he was seen at work and my lawyer says he could be there to catch up on projects and meetings. I can understand how the company can't leave his projects abandoned, but I don't understand why he wouldn't be terminated. The company states in the handbook they don't tolerate harassment of any kind.

My lawyer and I are still in the middle of some back and fourth with the company's lawyer and the case hasn't been won or settled yet..but in the meantime my question is..wouldn't it be likely for the company to terminate him at this point? If he is back at work does the company not believe that the sexual harassment was severe enough for him not to be fired and is this a bad sign for my case?"

Before I graduated, I was working at a large firm as a HR advisor. This was a great starting point for me and really gave me some good experience, but I eventually moved on from here to pursue a larger role and to make my way up.

I joined another large firm working specifically in recruitment. I lasted 2 months in this role due to a number of different factors. Basically I was given no training on how to do the role at all, the culture was not right for me at all, and I was commuting into the city each day an hour each way and had pretty much no work to do. This really blew my confidence as I thought I had made the right move to this role for my career progression.

I ended up being unemployed for 2 months, before I finally landed a role early August. This was not in HR, however it was an administration role doing really basic data entry work. I am still currently in this role but it is temporary and only until early December. Although the team is really nice, I'm also finding this role extremely boring and have little to no work to do most days.

Combine this with my previous bad experience, I'm really starting to become discouraged with this type of working environment. It makes me anxious to think about where I go next, and if I'm going to end up in the same place I have before. I try my hardest to do a research of the company before accepting the offer, but no matter what it seems as though a lot of the things I'm told in interviews (e.g. plenty of work to do, good team culture), are just straight up lies.

Due to my bad experiences, I feel as though I've lost a bit of passion for working in HR, and as such I'm am contemplating a complete career change. I am the type of person who needs their mind to be kept busy, I need to be productive otherwise I struggle to concentrate and don't have the ability to innovate. I have been really thinking about taking up some sort of trade or outdoor work as I know I'll be kept busy, however this hasn't ever really been my type of style.

I will be starting to job hunt in the next month or so because as I mentioned my current role ends in December and I will need work for the new year. I would really appreciate some help as to what I should do here. I'm still young and early on in my career, but I've been really put off by the thought of constant job hopping and delaying progress in my career. Thanks guys."
Unfair hiring practice at UN system agency (France),AskHR,3,d0u6r7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d0u6r7/unfair_hiring_practice_at_un_system_agency_france/,2,1567879235.0,"Hey HR folks,

I heard through the grapevine Friday morning that a coveted administrative position, essentially an appointment as personal attendant to the Director General of a UN organization I'd prefer not to name, a position which I'm fairly qualified for, was only advertised with the graduate network of a certain elite French school (*grande √©cole*) to which I don't have access. To my knowledge, all UN agencies have to publicly advertise staff positions, which is why, for example, you can find an ad to be the next chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court if you look on Indeed. I also know the UN has a watchdog body for fraud and corruption, the Office of Internal Oversight Services, but I don't know how aggressive a course to chart personally.

The recruitment ended about a week ago and the position was filled in record time while the rest of France was off vacationing -- not sure if a contract's been signed. I tried calling the person in charge of the recruitment procedure but the call dropped. I'm going to try again Monday. But said person began to defend in so many words their choice to limit the recruitment because of very pointed skills requirements.

I'm wondering as HR professionals or people with experience in the UN system or the French public sector what you think the most effective plan would be on my end?

On the one hand, I would really like a crack at the position. I may be able to threaten them with serious trouble. The agency only tested and interviewed two applicants, one of whom was grossly underskilled, without looking over their CVs first (I have a few e-mail exchanges). The cabinet in question has previously come under fire from journalists for none other than unfair hiring practices. The 'pointed skills' argument advanced by the recruiting official is totally unfounded, as there are dozens of master's programs specialized in political communications, audiovisual, literature, cited in the job description.

It's not unthinkable that I could get my CV on the desk of the cabinet head through shmoozing, but is that the right way to go? Even if they let me try my hand, who's to say that they'd act fairly, given the process would remain 'behind closed doors'?

On the other hand, the employees of this agency may be high up and politically connected enough to be totally immune to anything I could hit them with. I've never worked there and I don't know the UN system well at all. As a youngish foreign-born person, I'm also more than a little bit out of my depth, and am not used to treating bigwigs like this with anything but polite deference.

Would anybody out there be kind enough to offer advice? Thank you all for providing me with a forum for venting, in any case. Feel free to reply to me in French, if you like."

So, I've been working at a theme park for two years, a little more than a year as an department trainer.
To clarify, a department trainer acquires all the new hirees off the company classes and processes them through the 2-day on-site training period. 
Day 1 On Site for me, as a trainer, would mean that I go over company policies and appearance and introduce them to money handling, cashiering, taking breaks, and guest service. 
Day 2 On Site is me shadowing them and making corrections and finalizing materials.

My hourly wage is $12.20. I work 5-6 days every week, for 6.5-8 hours every day. Regularly, I would be training 2-4 different people in the span of 4-5 consecutive days.

I've been meaning to take it up to HR for the unfair treatment, considering that I am expected to fulfill my regular work duties while training someone else. I have worked under situations I shouldn't have to, including giving breaks and taking care of the store while training someone (trainers and trainees are peas in a pod).

It's very exhausting, and has caused several anxiety attacks on very busy days. 
But I train because I wanted to make changes that I fulfilled, and I love teaching others.

I have tried to step down from being a trainer but was denied and told that there's no backing out. 

It's unfair, demanding, and tiresome. 

Please advise.

I have a coworker (we'll call him Red) that has a very odd sense of humor. It can be dry and borderline inappropriate. He can be very serious at times with a short temper, but cracking jokes just as easy. It's difficult to tell what mood he is in and when he's joking. The workplace is retail, everyone is pretty laid back. So, a lot of jokes everyone lets slide. However, recently Red realized I was being trained for a management position like him. No major changes in his behavior towards me after finding out, but I can't help wonder if some of his jokes lately are malicious or with intent. He'll joke about certain things I know that he doesn't and things he knows that I don't. He's joke about my ""bossy-ness"", or being favorited by managers.



To desicribe Red's type of joking, it's usually small jabs at other coworkers, but with specific coworkers that do the same. He'll joke about other's interests or how they handle situations at work. However, you can't tell when he's joking. He'll put on a straight face and wait for your reaction before laughing. I'm used to sarcasm and snarky light-hearted comments, but his is a different humor. It's just how he approaches his joke and timing that are borderline inappropriate (if tension in the workplace is high, a coworker is struggling, etc). 



Now, for the one that got me. He's never met or talked to my boyfriend. My boyfriend and I have one car, so how our schedules align he takes the car and picks me up after work waiting 10+ minutes before I clock out. One day, Red had to step outside to lock up company cars and noticed my boyfriend parked waiting the last few minutes of my shift. When Red returned he tells me *""Yeah, I talked to your man out there about his drug deal business. I told him you were telling us all about it"".* It was really random and I just stared at him blankly. There was no former joking about drugs. I asked him how my boyfriend responded and he said that there wasn't one. Ok, weird, and random. I was skeptical, it felt like it was more accusing or threatening than joke. I shrugged it off and told him that his joke was weird. I get off work and ask my boyfriend about it and he tells me that Red just waved and didn't say a word to him. The next couple days go by, I don't see Red. So, 4 days later he comes up to me as soon as I walk in and asks if I talked to my boyfriend after his joke. I told him, and Red laughs and says *""Yeah, I didn't even say anything to him. How did he react?"".* I reply, ""He thought it was weird"".* Red busts up laughing and walks away. Then, he tells other coworkers about the joke and everyone is just not sure how to respond or doesn't understand. I didn't think it was a big deal. Until, a week later he comes up to the car at the driver side where my bf is as I'm getting out and asks for a few of the baggies he's selling. Red: *""So, you got any of those white baggies for me.""* My bf just kind of shrugs and says, *""You got the wrong guy"".* Neither me or my bf knew how to respond so we just kind of changed the subject. It's the first time a coworker's joke or sense of humor at this job made me feel irritated. Especially, when I just don't find it funny and considering the position we're both training for. I can't tell if he's trying to start rumors or irritate my bf. It's frustrating, I feel like I'm overreacting (probably am), but I still find it inappropriate. Red has never talked to my bf before or made jokes at/about him. Is this an issue, and how do I politely tell Red to stop? I talked it over with my store manger asking for advice on how to handle it and not to involve HR. My SM suggested I speak with Red with SM involved for formality purpose and witness. Am I overreacting, is he joking maliciously, and how do I go about this while preventing further tension after speaking with Red?"

Recently, my job started enforcing a new policy to have all employees arrive 5 minutes prior to their shift and members of management who are hourly have to arrive 15 min earlier and clock in.
 Not clocking in on the 15 minute mark will still point you, even if you are on time for your regular shift. 
Everyone this rule applies to is required to cut the accumulated overtime by taking longer lunches, so in the end, we do not get paid for our extra time here.

I usually come in 10 minutes prior to my start time in case there are any unforeseen traffic issues and I'm upset that now I have to come in 25 minutes earlier every day just so I can receive the same amount of pay I would normally. I am also upset that I also recently got 6 points for clocking in at 8:47 rather than their 8:45 time, so now I have to do 24 hours of volunteer work if I want to erase the fact I was only 13 minutes early.

By phone if it's a yes, by mail otherwise"". They also told me they already hired someone for the position, but they might open another one. This was after they asked about my salary expectation. I did give something on the higher end, but they didn't even try to negotiate (She said it's just for information, she isn't the one making the decision)

Am I wrong to think that this is probably a no ? Why tell me they already hired someone and that they are also interviewing someone else ? Why would they hire someone before finishing the interviews with others, but tell me to wait until the end ? Could it be because I asked too much ? 

I was really under the impression that the tech guy and hiring manager really liked me, I'm kinda bumped if this whole situation is not just an HR move they do to everyone. Even if I somehow get an offer, I'll probably wonder if I was just their backup plan

Should I be honest about my cannabis use?,AskHR,2,d0bee7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d0bee7/should_i_be_honest_about_my_cannabis_use/,7,1567770227.0,"Let me start by saying that I am NOT looking for advice on how to pass a drug test. 

I am in northern Indiana, about 8 miles from the Michigan state line. (United States)

I've worked retail all my life and it is starting to become impossible for my body to met the physical demands. It has gotten so bad that after a few xrays, CTs, and MRIs, I was given a physical therapy script for my shoulder, my hips, and a knee. I'm only 28.

While at physical therapy, I was talking to a technician there about how much I hate retail because it tries to undo all the work I put in at PT. She immediately suggested that I work there, as a physical therapy technician. I got an interview about a week later. 

The woman that interviewed me ended up being a PT that I had worked briefly with one day during a session. She had talked to the techs and the two PTs that I normally worked with about me, and she liked what she heard. I was all but hired on the spot.

Of course, during the new hire paperwork, there is a sheet about drug testing. I did not say anything at the time, because I have worked places where they basically just want you to sign the sheet to cover their butts but never actually test you (gets too expensive I suppose). 

Now. I know for a fact I am not going to pass this test ""on my own"". I am NOT going to do anything illegal or immoral because I am just too much of an anxious and awkward person to try to get away with it. I know what I need to do if I go through with the drug test to give myself the best chances at passing.

They will find drugs in my system even if I hadn't used cannabis, since I am on prescription medications for mental illnesses and can prove it (prescription bottles, prescription history, and DR note). Should I just be honest with them? I am suppose to call on Monday to set up a time to get the test done, and I could discuss it with them then.

Should I tell them about what the test will find? Because I do not want to waste their time and resources/money, and I cannot go through the anxiety of knowing I'm going to fail it. I've taken an at home test, and I am still showing up positive for THC. I guess the one reason I want to talk with them about it is to see if they will give me more time to ""clean up"" so I will pass it (if they want me there that badly) or if cannabis is even a drug they worry about (opioids are a much bigger concern in a hospital setting, I believe, even though they do not have a pharmacy there).

There's never been a job I have wanted more than this one. My PTs believe that I could have hEDS, which is a syndrome that effects the collagen in my body. I am constantly in pain from subluxations, and I am not going to get ""better"". There is no cure, only management. Working here would be a dream because I can help people like me, and I will be around my therapists all day who will crack the whip when I stand or sit how I should not be standing or sitting (I do it without realizing).

(More about my use: I was what I would consider a heavy user until I had the interview and realized I would be tested. That was almost 3 weeks ago, but I have a high body fat percentage and I am still testing very positive with preliminary at home tests. However you feel about cannabis, I don't really care, this post is more about being honest with the HR department and not having a positive drug test on my record somehow.)

TL;DR: Employer likes me, I love them, won't pass a piss test because of cannabis, should I tell them?

Edit: I bit the bullet and talked to the HR contact. She was super understanding and said as long as there's nothing else in my system, they will still start me but likely have me take another test afterward to show that I have been abstaining. 

She also said that she personally thinks it should be legalized and that she has family members who use for the same reasons I do (nighttime pain management). She appreciated my honesty and told me that it couldnt have been easy to tell her that. And that she doesn't want me at work under the influence (I agreed - for my safety but mostly the patient's safety) and that they do not do random drug tests unless there is a very serious reason to do so. Which isnt my style so I will be okay. 

Thank you all for the advice! It was much better than stressing about it and panicking."

I had most preparations set up for the most part (Housing, Finances, Travel, state Department filing etc) and was slated to leave this Saturday Afternoon. The company has been communicative and no issues or red flags except for one thing: The Visa.

At first, the application I thought should (as most other countries) be mailed or electronically mailed to me prior to travel, but due to what I presumed is immigration backup and my timing applying, has been held up for the most part, I never got the visa. I recognize that I should've had the foresight to inquire or ask about it before applying for the job, but when asking the questions to the company about a month back, I never was directly answered on the question.

I asked again this week, on Saturday, along with some other onboarding questions, about and the company that usually replied within the same business day had to take almost 72 Hours (Not accounting the time difference) to reply back with the specific Visa answer (they had answered the other half dozen or so questions I had within the time)

They replied that I was to put myself as a ""Visitor/Tourist"" on my immigration forms into the country and that they hadn't had the visa finalized yet, but it should be ready within the first official week of employment by next week. I am usually understanding of situations like this. but considering the Volatile nature of the Region, i have concerns. I have a set date for exit from the country for the last day on the contract in 2020, but I don't know how to explain my exit date without explaining my work intentions, putting me in a paradox of sorts (they're asking i say I'm a tourist until next week) but considering potentially heightened security, along with the context of the protest leaves me very, very nervous about having issues or even detention at immigration. I concede it could be the heightened tension of the region and my own nervousness about travel that is causing it. 

Is there advice to proceed in the situation, should I try to back out, or am I making a mountain out of a molehill, and asking before tomorrow how to interview would help? The company hasn't like it's being dishonest (It's a small company of American expats y based around performance art) and there have been no real red flags anywhere else in the process. If theres anywhere else I should ask instead, a redirection would be much appreciated."

Very few people want to work on her projects and very few people respect her outside of her technical skills. We've had good people threaten to quit if they are assigned to her.  One of the reasons she is so good is because she consistently puts in 60/70 hours per week. She does this because she is the only one without a family and because she doesn't trust anyone else to do the work. because of this self-inflicted wound, she is resentful and critical of others.

Like I said, she is also one of the best performers. It's not as simple as firing her because she is toxic.  We would lose money and skills if she wasn't here.  We've tried talking to her about her bad attitude but it seems she is just finding other critical people and using them as an eco-chamber in secret, but it always leaks out.

About a month later DOM received a job promotion to another department, complete with a nice raise. A little while after that a brand new employee (NE) mentioned that he got a bad vibe from the DOM, and the W relayed her experience of having her ass grabbed by DOM, and told the NE to report any inappropriate behavior from DOM, as he has a history. NE mentioned this to other people and it eventually got back to DOMs new boss, and she went to HR to complain. W was written up for revealing ""sensitive personnel information"" about DOM.

Incorrect information given by HR resulted in my denial of state disability (maternity) benefits....,AskHR,4,d02m25,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d02m25/incorrect_information_given_by_hr_resulted_in_my/,19,1567727576.0,"Writing this on behalf on my wife....

(US employer) As the title states...my wife and I had our first child not to long ago. I do not work at her company. My wife‚Äôs company does not offer any benefits related to the birth of a child - only the state benefits. 

My wife had a massive amount of PTO hours accrued (she‚Äôs been with the company for 8 years). Per state and company policy, an employee has to use their PTO before receiving any state benefits. Due to this being our child and not an expert in the rules my wife went to HR and asked them various questions. The biggest one was....

Email to HR rep from my wife...

‚Äúwill I (my wife) receive state benefits (2/3 pay for 10 weeks) after I (my wife) exhaust my PTO‚Äù 

HR came back and said ‚ÄúYes‚Äù. We were skeptical about the response due to the policy and we went back to the HR rep and asked again and again and true HR rep said my wife would receive benefits after PTO. The HR rep even ‚Äúcalled‚Äù the state and confirmed her understand. We have all this in an email. 

Fast forward and my wife got denied for states benefits because my wife can‚Äôt receive double payments (PTO and state). The states payment are only available 4 weeks before and 6 weeks after birth. My wife was receiving PTO during that time. My wife was not made aware that having to use her PTO during the 4 weeks pre and 6 weeks post delivery would make her ineligible for State disability. The HR rep said she would get paid at a later date - just not at that time, which was wrong. If my wife had known what She knows now, my wife would have used her PTO and in a much different way ( essentially maximize both payments ). 

We both think the company is liable for this error/incorrect information. The head HR rep (who was not involved) claims it‚Äôs my wife‚Äôs  responsibility  cuz she received the policy even tho the company gave us incorrect information. 

What do you guys think? It‚Äôs close to 10,000 of loss income.

TL;DR = Company HR rep gave my wife incorrect information which resulted in her getting denied from state maternity benefits (amounts to $10,000 of loss income )."

>TL;DR: My new contract job with no end-date catfished me and it isn't the recruiting company (my technical employer)'s fault. I've tried changing it, but I need to get out. **How can I retain a good relationship with the recruiting company and cover my own ass so hopping from this job doesn't reflect poorly on me? Should I warn them?**

***EDIT: I realize I was unclear - the recruiting company is a separate entity. I'm not technically employed by the corporation I work at, but by my recruiting company.***

(Please excuse me for being so vague, I want to protect my privacy)

After being laid off from a job I loved and job searching for several months, I utilized a recruiter to help me find a job. I was sent a job description for this role, and I thought, ""this sounds nothing like what I'm looking for.""

The recruiter assured me that the employer was looking for someone just like me, so I interviewed and really clicked with my current manager. She showed an empathetic and anti-corporate-bullshit affect. She talked up this amazing opportunity that sounded in-line with my goals.

I started to get super excited about what was possible and accepted an offer the next day, without meeting anyone else on the team. **I won't ever accept a job this quickly again.** I desperately needed a job after being unemployed and it honestly sounded like a great fit.

I could tell on my first day that something had gone terribly wrong. It was obvious that there was a lot of tension around my boss. I learned that she didn't get proper approvals to hire someone at my level, and everyone around me assumed they were hiring someone entry-level. She was kind of staging a coup with me, using me for her goals to shake things up that no one asked her to shake up. She had promised me duties that were being fulfilled by other people, and half the stuff she talked about doing with me directly opposed what her manager wants for the company. I was suddenly spending all of my time either being told by my boss to do work I knew we would get yelled at for doing later, or hearing my manager and their supervisor bitch to me about each other.

Add on to that the millions of miscommunications because no one knows how to work with my skill set and the mega-corporate atmosphere that is draining my soul, and I just can't see myself there for much longer.

I tried fixing these issues by communicating to everyone involved directly, giving feedback that I'm unhappy and that these issues need to be resolved in order for me to continue staying. Not much has improved, and I'm finding that my ethics aren't in line with this company anyway. I'm looking for other opportunities, but my main problem is that I'm employed by the recruiting company. They helped me get this job and it's not their fault that I was catfished. I don't want to mess up my reputation with them because I'd love to use their help to find employment again.

Now they're looking to add another person to my team, using the same recruiter. I'm worried it's going to be a shit show. How do I cover my ass here? Should I call my recruiter and let her know that I'm unhappy? I don't want my leaving to anger her. She has also been unkind to me before this role when I didn't accept a low-ball job offer she sent me, so I worry she will blame me for this job not working out and potentially damage my reputation among other recruiters.

Thank you in advance for any help you can provide."

So really theres no one protecting our butts when something goes sour. 

I decide ive had enough of this place and send in my resignation letter this morning.

My employer showed up to my house an hour ago to confront me about resigning. She still isnt convinced that im resigning, and tells me to ‚Äòthink about it‚Äô when ive already decided and told her im leaving.

However, I‚Äôm not technically an employee. I‚Äôm a contractor. But I think that argument is basically null because she tells me where and when I work, which isnt something contractors do.

We have no HR department to talk to this about, because shes our sole point of contact (which sucks btw cuz shes not the nicest person)

So my question is... is there anything I can do to make sure this doesnt happen again? she has at least 30 employees so i wouldnt want this to happen to them either.

He applied for a job that listed both leadership and management skills; they were skills listed as required but listed as preferable if the leadership and management was in that specific industry.

He has industry specific leadership and management of approximately 1 year. 
He additionally had 8 years of military leadership (he was an officer)

HR offered him the position with a salary that he then countered; citing his experience in both the industry, other jobs and military experience. 

The HR person went through what he got ‚Äúpoints‚Äù for and when he asked about his 8 year of military leadership and service the HR person said ‚Äúyour military service doesn‚Äôt count towards anything‚Äù 

Is this ok? This kind of language? Discrediting his military service as ANY kind of experience? 

We‚Äôre unsure of the legality of any of those kinds of remarks or decisions and while he doesn‚Äôt expect to be given a job just because he‚Äôs a veteran, we were both taken aback that HR said his service counted for nothing; especially since he was a leader and managed many people...a key component in the job he has applied for.

I was planning to leave my current position and decided to read the employment contract which I signed 5-6 years ago. This is what it states:

**Period of Employment. Your employment with the Company will be ‚Äúat will,‚Äù meaning that either you or the Company will be entitled to terminate your employment at any time and for any reason, with or without cause, giving a 30 days‚Äô notice by either party whoever wants to terminate it. But the Company reserves the right to terminate the services of the You at any time because of but not limited to improper conduct of You, theft or any other breach of contract.**

So I live in Illinois and the above passage seems to be an at-will employment contract, but how does the 30 days' notice statement impact me? I want to avoid giving the 30-day notice in case the employer decides to immediately terminate me (Which I believe they can due to the ambiguity of the second statement).  Also doesn't the first and the second statement conflict since the employer also has to provide a 30 days notice?

Has anyone had any experience with a contract like this? Thanks for your help."

Husband getting put on a PIP...I have questions,AskHR,8,czc1nw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/czc1nw/husband_getting_put_on_a_pipi_have_questions/,21,1567579024.0,"(Location: USA.)

First:

Learning of the PIP made us consider that maybe his ASD/Asperger's needs the accommodation of extra bluntness in feedback. We didn't realize he may need this accommodation until he was told he'd be put on the PIP--because we didn't realize until then that they had any issues with his performance. Thus the need for bluntness.

My instinct today was to advise him to request this accommodation, but then I worried about it appearing as an excuse or butt-covering. Is this a valid concern? What should he do on this score?

Second:

He also has a chronic illness that doctors haven't gotten completely under control yet. It was diagnosed after he began working there (but in retrospect the doctors concluded he had been suffering from it for years before finally being diagnosed). He has a specialist overseeing his condition, and this doctor says it just takes time to get this condition under control and they're doing all they can. It's been two years.

I believe he mentioned the new diagnosis to his boss/coworkers when he finally received it, but hasn't requested any accommodation because the flex time and PTO seemed enough. I do wonder if their actual concern may be attendance, or even not so much literal attendance as a subjective impression of not caring. Or of looking for another job; he's not, it's actual doctor's appointments, but maybe they don't believe that.

Anyway, he had the PTO available that he took off for appointments (they have combined sick + vacation as just ""PTO""), but the nature of these is that there's not much advance warning. He works from home as much as he can when he has these, and as far as I know he was still getting work done.

My fears:

I've seen comments on Ask A Manager etc. like, ""If you‚Äôre committing to your PIP, and wanting to make it through, then you really cannot be asking for time off for almost any reason."" But they are actual doctor's appointments, so he actually does need to attend. On the flip side, he just got through a difficult treatment process (a week of daily appointments leading up to a minor operation), and now will have 3 weeks during which there's only one appointment. So I also fear they'll think it's the PIP that caused him to not take time off for 3 weeks, and then when he has more appointments again they'll think he's ""backsliding""--when really the break in appointments/PTO use is due to the doctors and not him or the PIP...

Finally:

His direct boss sent a post-meeting email stating that (a) performance problems have arisen since the mid-year review process, IOW in the past 3 months; (b) direct boss doesn't know what the actual performance problems are; except (c) maybe something like making unilateral design decisions that he should have ""socialized"" first.

When I asked husband about this, he said that when people don't reply to requests for feedback, he has to make the decision himself, and he's seen others do the same, so he doesn't understand. So I wonder what he should do if the issue of ""people not replying to requests for feedback"" arises again. Keep pestering them to reply? Document that they didn't? If the latter, document it to whom? Etc.

I had mentioned the drug distribution and sexual harassment was talked about on the sales floor and that actual drug deals didnt happen in store. They decided to interview employees.

Question about workplace rights working as a contractor?

My boss is both the owner and the CEO of the company. She is extremely mentally unstable and if and accident is made (or if she believes that one has even if it hasn't), she goes on a RAMPAGE, spamming my phone with verbally abusive text messages. She also constantly cuts my pay for trivial things. 

The way this job works is we get assigned a location, drive to pick up equipment, then arrive early to set up class before we teach. We must text her as soon as we arrive on the property - sure, make sense, I understand that and I follow protocol. We must then send a second text an undisclosed amount of time later when we're in the building. For this specific example, she sent me to a community center where there was a baseball game going on, so not only did I have to carry two large bins of equipment, but I had to park far away. I arrived 30 minutes early on-site, but it took me 12 to get into the building. I was not late for the class, nor was any harm done for anyone other than minorly inconveniencing my boss. I will attach the message (1) in another post. I pride myself on being a professional instructor, I don't usually have my phone volume on because it would look bad if it was ringing constantly in front of parents and kids signing in. She deemed it necessary to cut my pay that day. I was furious.

Another example for you, as shown in the screenshot (2, attached in another post), this happened maybe my second or third shift working for the company. If someone extra shows up to your class you're supposed to let the boss know. I had misunderstood and texted her that someone didn't show up to the class. She proceeded to spam me again with terrible text messages.

I'm just wondering what my rights as a contractor are (in British Columbia, Canada) and if there is anything I can do to recoup lost wages + emotional suffering or to whom I should report this?

Also, just for reference, I'm someone who has 5 years of teaching experience, excellent credibility and great references from other city jobs. I've never had issues in any other workplace."
Just accepted a 2.5-3 month long contract for an HR - Generalist Position and I need help understanding the contracting process and whether this is a good or bad route that I am taking.,AskHR,2,czcdaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/czcdaz/just_accepted_a_253_month_long_contract_for_an_hr/,8,1567580569.0,"
Hello, so basically I (22F) accepted a contract HR Generalist role, temporarily replacing an individual who is out on leave due to an injury. During my interview, I felt comfortable and felt that I would gain a lot more experience out of this role than the other that was more office management/assistant roles. I felt that this would open up more opportunities as well. Only downside is how short term it is. They mentioned that they can‚Äôt promise me a job by the end of it, and I would say this was just their due diligence but they even mentioned things like ‚ÄúWould you be comfortable with working in Sales or in another role upon completing this job?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt promise anything for the future as we aren‚Äôt sure what it holds, etc‚Äù So although I am thankful I am given an opportunity, the anxious side of me is worried I am doing this for no reason and wasting both mine and the employers time. I‚Äôm also scared that this will hurt me finding a job when it hits November time. 

Right now I am asking for some moral support as I got denied today by a great permanent position (a bit disappointed, words of encouragement would be great as I don‚Äôt have a big support system and I am beating myself up atm) and the contract position extended an offer so I accepted it as it is currently my only option.¬†¬†I start next week and I am also looking for advice and wisdom to survive the uncertainty of what lies in my future in November. Also if you have any advice on how I can actively look better to the employer or actively apply to other jobs during this time that would be fabulous.

Apologies for rambling and unclarity in post, feeling a lot of emotions it seems!

How soon is too soon to transfer?,AskHR,2,czbs71,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/czbs71/how_soon_is_too_soon_to_transfer/,1,1567577771.0,"Location: MA, USA

I recently applied for two identical positions (licensed healthcare provider) at two different hospitals owned by the same company. I took an offer from my second favorite and I'm starting in the next few weeks, but I'm very interested in transferring to the other location as I feel like it would be a better fit for a variety of professional and personal reasons.

According to company policy, there are no restrictions on transferring besides not being able to in the first 90 days of employment, and that transfers have to be approved by your current manager and the manager you would be working for after the transfer.

While I'd be doing the exact same job at either hospital, my current hospital has the burden of orienting my to their medical records systems, company policies, etc. so I would feel bad about ""ditching"" them so soon after coming on board. Additionally, the position is very team-oriented and interdisciplinary, so the team would have to deal with me leaving and learning to work with another person.

Unfortunately, openings are few and far between at the other hospital, so I feel like if I see an internal listing for an opening I need to take it or I might be waiting for a while for another opportunity to come up.

I know I'm getting way ahead of myself, but how soon is too soon to request a transfer? When should I have this conversation with my manager and what do I say?"
Asking about favorite books in job interviews?,AskHR,3,czbnbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/czbnbg/asking_about_favorite_books_in_job_interviews/,18,1567577129.0,"I'm in Tennessee. 

I'm a director (middle manager, between a manager and VP, not ""board of directors"" type director) in a large corporation, and an avid reader.  A big part of the way I approach leadership, productivity, self-improvement, interpersonal relationships, and just life philosophy, I learned from books.

I ask my managers to have a monthly book club with me, and strongly suggest they do the same with their employees.

I often, but not all of the time, like to ask interview candidates for what their top 5 most influential books are.  The idea is not to judge them based on the answers, but to prompt a follow-up discussion on something we have both read, and to develop a good rapport.

I got challenged on this recently, not by a candidate but by a peer on the hiring panel, that this question may be, or may appear to be biased.  Do you think so?

I certainly do not want to ask questions that introduce bias and I very actively try to fight unconscious bias in all of our hiring processes.

The rationale that the person gave was that if someone did not (or did) say that the Bible was one of their most influential books, that they may be judged based on that.  I would absolutely never factor religious affiliation into a hiring decision.  But I know that there are a good number of hiring managers that would (I'm in the deep south).  So I can understand someone being put off or intimated by this question.

What do you think?  It's important to me that I communicate that we are an inclusive environment, and of course also that I live up to that standard.

Is there a better way to ask this question?  Should I ask what are your top 5 most influential nonreligious books, or does saying that make it even worse?  Should I just resign myself to asking if they have read specific books?

The last thing I want is for candidates to think I'm biasing on them (either for or against), and then them not saying anything about it.  I have asked this question hundreds of times and never had this issue until now.

What do you think?  I certainly don't want to dismiss my colleague, I do think it's a valid concern and I'd like to make sure that I'm not intimidating candidates.  At the same time I'd like to continue discussing books during job interviews as I've had some very fruitful conversations out of it.

(CA) Changing last name amidst on-boarding process,AskHR,1,czdk16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/czdk16/ca_changing_last_name_amidst_onboarding_process/,7,1567586633.0,"Hi!

So I just got a new job (YAY) that I am starting in a couple weeks. Meanwhile, I am in the process of changing my last name after getting married. I have submitted for the name change with social security, but have not yet applied for a new driver's license or passport.

I know I need I-9 documentation when I start, so I'm wondering if I should wait to apply for the new DL until after the on-boarding process? If I go to the DMV now, my new license surely won't arrive in the mail before my first day at work. Obviously they will give me a paper temporary license in the meantime, but I don't think that will work for the I-9. 

I know starting the job with my maiden name and then a couple weeks later letting them know my last name has changed is probably a huge pain. Please advise what my best options are and anything else I might not be thinking of in this scenario. 

Thanks in advance!"
A co-worker is setting me up to appear negligent and even incompetent in my duties. I'm afraid for my job with having little if anything to prove it. Any guidance that might be offered will be very much appreciated.,AskHR,80,cywnsh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/cywnsh/a_coworker_is_setting_me_up_to_appear_negligent/,23,1567494844.0,"[SC, USA] 

Title gives the gist. I have a co-worker who, for some reason, is setting me up to appear negligent and even incompetent in my duties and performance. 

Some examples have included not passing along vital information to me and telling our team leads and project managers he had. 

Such as time and dates of staff meetings, meetings with clients, changes in company specific operating procedures and changes in client POCs. 

In addition, some of my reports, client information, and reference materials have either disappeared entirely or have gone missing and later found in very unlikely places. 

Alone, one or two of these wouldn't make a difference. However, over time and in increasing instance, it's begining to make me look purposefully negligent in my job. 

The guy doing this used to be a project manager and operations liaison with the company. After a long medical leave, he returned to work in a regular (non management) roll. 

Now, because of his prior role, management often disseminates information through him to the rest of the team much of the time. I tried to delicately broach this topic with my direct supervisor in my performance review. He told me that this co-worker of mine was a ""valuable resource"" to have and has been telling my supervisor I had a lot to improve on; Although giving these poor reports ""only when asked"".  It was inferred that this was why I was not selected for a recent promotion availability. 

However, to contrast all this, my performance and output has been outstanding. Several of our vendors prefer to work with me specifically and my yield for the company is often greater than my peers. But numbers and client/vendor ""reviews"" arent helping me. 

I don't know what to do. I can see what he's doing as clear as day, but it's subtle and I can't prove it.

Whereas before it was just making me look bad, now it's actually harming my productivity and progression in the company. 

I am afraid for my job. 

What can I do? Any advice at all is welcomed and appreciated."

"New boss is very uncomfortable with my 32 hour work week, but why? (US)",AskHR,20,cyzm80,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/cyzm80/new_boss_is_very_uncomfortable_with_my_32_hour/,24,1567511109.0,"Thanks for reading, and I apologize in advance if this seems very long.  TL:DR boss expects 40 hours out of me when 32 is enough, but she can't verbalize exactly why.

I have been with this job (hazardous waste transportation and disposal) for a little over 2 years, and I feel I am quite competent.  I started in the warehouse handling the containers of waste and sorting them to the different disposal facilities and gradually moved into the office full-time.  It's pretty sweet.  I love my job and my team and I have gained many valuable certifications in order to be in the position I am in--not to mention the direct experience and knowledge I have gained in the industry and federal regulations simply by being a part of it.  

Well, that's all good and fine, but childcare during work is excruciating.  It costs around $200 a week to have my son in daycare and frankly, I can't afford it without childcare assistance from the government.  Where I live, there isn't a sliding scale where you pay more when you earn more then eventually you are able to pay the entire cost.  Instead, it's a hard number and one dollar over that gets you cut off: $1,860 a month gross.  At my rate of pay that's right around 32 hours a week.

That's perfectly fine, knowing what I know about my job and the flow.  I had it worked out with my boss and everything was great.  Checked the employee handbook, and they consider ""full-time"" employment to begin in excess of 30 hours.  The work I do does not require 40 full hours (realistically I only do ""actual work"" about 25 hours a week, the rest of the time is waiting for random emails) and it made sense that the company not pay me for hours I'm wasting.  I tried working shorter days but when I get there something always happens and I end up staying late.  I finally realized I do *nothing* on Tuesdays.  The guys aren't back with waste and paperwork for me to process yet.  I've already worked out with my suppliers to deliver on non-Tuesday days.  Any emails on Tuesdays can be answered from home with no access to my work station at the office, and my office phone forwards to my cell phone.  Sweet.  I'll just not work on Tuesdays.  Perfect.

The boss ended up getting laid low with some long-term medical disability so her boss is now in charge.  She confronted me about my short hours during my yearly performance review, so I explained to her why my hours are ""erratic"" (her words) and framed it as a benefit to the company because they dont have to pay me for literally nothing.  I keep my benefits, and my kid gets care during the day.  Everything runs smoothly at the office, and nothing is impacted.  I'm happier in general (I work beside a salesperson and listening to cold calls all day is sucking the life out of me, when he asks me every time he hangs up ""how the call sounded"" every. freaking. time.) and I feel like I am striking a good work/life balance.  However, she has a problem with this.  

She can't quite explain what the problem is, but she feels I should be there 40 hours a week.  She gave me some explanation about how if I get Tuesdays off then everyone's going to want Tuesdays off and that's not fair to ""everyone else"".  I think that's pretty much crap because there's seven of us on the team and I know for a fact they all would rather make more money, not less.  I can't wrap my mind around it.  Why does she insist I ""should"" work 40 hours?  I asked her that directly in my performance review, and I said with regret that I would have to seek new employment if she really felt the need to push the issue.  She didn't understand what I meant so I explained I'd have to get a pay raise of something like 70% to be able to pay my bills and pay for child care and I could never ask for something like that with a straight face, so honestly a McJob somewhere would make more financial sense in my situation if she wasn't willing to work with me.  She grudgingly said she'd take it up with HR but that was a month ago and I haven't officially heard back from her about it.  She's been signing off on my Tuesdays off every week since then, though, without complaint.  Still, every so often during our daily check in calls (she is based in a different state) she still finds ways to mention me ""figuring out"" my situation or asking if I've reconsidered my hours.  I'm not rude to her, but I have thought about this, for many hours, and the balance I have created seems fair.  I can't get a straight answer without her appealing to some vague potential conflict with no basis in our office's reality, or her saying something like, ""well, 40 hours is full time."" 

Am I missing something?  I mean, I feel this impending doom over my head that one day the shoe will drop because there is some bigger-picture thing I don't understand.  I didn't sign a contract promising 40 hours a week.  The work flow doesn't require my physical presence in the office on Tuesday.  Am I being unreasonable, and she is gently guiding me to retain my employment without saying the words ""your job is on the line if you don't play ball""?"

Okay, here is the deal. I currently work for the state of SC and I have been experiencing some frustration and discomfort during our mandatory weekly meetings that include everyone in our office. 

During most meetings there is food available for everyone to eat. So typically at the start of the meeting, everyone gets a plate of food and is allowed to eat while the manager goes over any updates or trainings that need to be covered.

What has been making me uncomfortable is that the manager leads all of the staff in a group prayer as a way to bless the food prior to the start of every meeting. I know that a lot of the employees are Christian but I am not, and I feel like I am being forced to pray or at least pretend that I am praying during this time. It doesnt bother me if others want to pray for their food individually at all, but since my manager is the one initiating a group prayer i feel a little forced to participate as well.

I guess my question is, is it legal for my manager to do this?

Apprentice who finished 2 year apprenticeship(Coming to end of 3rd Year) Missing contract on database with HR,AskHR,3,cyo2s0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/cyo2s0/apprentice_who_finished_2_year/,2,1567454478.0,"So, I'll make this short an sweet.  

Been having issues at this place for some time in terms of pay and finishing my apprenticeship since my workload has exploded upon finishing.

I got curious about my original contract, so I gave our HR Connect a message through the system. I got the response back saying apparently I had no contract on the system? 

It's been a year since I finished the apprenticeship, August 2018 was when I finished. So it's been over a year since finishing and no new contract has been given to us to sign. Is this legal? We're meant to be fully employed yet we're still on apprentice wage(we're above min wage ¬£18,000 a year but should be on ¬£26,000+ for my role)

What are peoples thoughts on this? Currently got the internal Business HR investigating this although I don't think I'll get anything positive back from them about our pay etc..."

I got back from holiday over the weekend just gone and received there was a redundancy situation at work and I am at risk (safe to say i think I'm going). My only real bother is that they have planned this to get rid off me before I do 2 years so I'm not entitled to redundancy pay (which is 2 full weeks pay for me). I have my consultation meeting this Wednesday and I'm the last off my team to be reviewed so I believe they will make a decision then that most likely i'll be made redundant, so the 04/09/19 is potentially when my redundancy notice period starts (which is  a month in my contract) that brings me up to 02/10/19 when I leave, if I am right is there anyway off delaying the process i.e. haven't had enough time for representation I also am doing a degree I funded with with the open uni I have deadlines to meet etc?

YouTuber Blasts His Former Companies Publicly - Whistleblowing or Petty Revenge?,AskHR,5,cyctnr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/cyctnr/youtuber_blasts_his_former_companies_publicly/,7,1567387720.0,"Location: Internet/YouTube

I'm not sure how many HR professionals (if any) are keeping up with this, but there's a YouTuber who was fired from his company after making a negative video about his company's vendor. Now he makes [video after video](https://www.youtube.com/user/PHYSCO331/videos) about his former company, the company's vendor, and the other company he worked at a long time ago. The topics he rants about range from allegedly unethical business practices to story-time about his and other employees' experiences.

He claims that he is whistleblowing his targets' bad behavior. In your opinion, is it really whistleblowing or petty revenge for being fired? What are his chances of ever being hired again? How does HR handle someone like this, if at all? Would the companies involved be right in seeking legal recourse for libel and slander (it's both written in text form (the title cards) and verbally discussed)? What does the Reddit HR community think?"

Sorry for formatting. On mobile. 
Background: Hi there. I work as a hostess for a popular Korean bbq chain restaurant. At the hostess stand we have two cameras pointed directly at us. Company policy is that if someone is scheduled for 6 hours or more they receive an hour break. 

Story: Yesterday my manager tore me a new one. The first incident happened when I came in with a slightly wrinkly shirt. I didn‚Äôt notice until she pointed it out. I was pretty embarrassed and insecure after looking at everyone else‚Äôs non wrinkly shirts. After I clocked in she asked my co worker who was about to clock out if she could switch shirts with me. I was even more embarrassed and now wearing a shirt 3x too big for me. All night my sleeves were getting caught on things.  
     The next incident happened later on when I quoted someone a 10 minute wait. She came up to me and asked why. I wanted to explain that I wanted to give myself some time to make sure everything was prepared at their table and to make sure I was following the rotations so that each server received a fair amount of tables that night. But I froze up and didn‚Äôt say anything. She came at me very hostile and it scared me. 
     Incident #3 happened when there were two parties waiting for the rest of the party and crowding up the lobby. A party of 4 came in and I told them to give me a moment to prepare a table for them. My manager wanted them seated right away and didn‚Äôt listen when I spoke up and said one server needed another table. I was looking for a table in his section when she took the party and double seated someone who was about to get a large party soon. 
     Incident #4 happened when she told me to stock up my cart with plates, salt trays, and utensils. I stocked what I could before I whisked away to do something else and I forgot about it. She asked me to do it again and lectured me on why the cart needed to be stocked. I turned my back and walked away to grab what I needed when she called out for me. I went back to her and she said she needed to talk to me. There was no private space to talk as the office doubled as the hostess stand. 
     The Talk: My manager took me outside and we sat at a table near a busy walkway. She told me she wouldn‚Äôt schedule me for the weekdays because she feels that I haven‚Äôt been able to understand the work I do. I try to say that I understand but that she nitpicks and decides that things that are slow or don‚Äôt happen instantly is bad for business. Before I can say it she asks me how I would react if I was given a quote for ten minutes at a restaurant. I didn‚Äôt want to get fired and be a smart ass so I just said I‚Äôd be impatient. She then proceeded to tear into me. Insulting me then saying my customer service was good. Then went back to criticizing the way I do my job. I started to cry and she told me not to. She asked if the job was too much pressure. I‚Äôve dealt with much more than her but in the moment I just broke down as the day had been great until I went to work. I was insecure, embarrassed, and human. I told her I‚Äôve dealt with much worse. And dealt with worse things in life than the pressure of work. I enjoy work! I enjoy feeling needed! Having something to do! Making money! I couldn‚Äôt explain that as I was so choked up. She explained more about why she got on me about the incidents above and told me to take a ten minute break to calm down. All I could think about was how I felt. I did some breathing exercises and calmed down. I was working an eight hour shift and I was only halfway through. I just needed to hold on a little while longer before I could go home and relax. 
     The rest of my shift went semi-smoothly with my manager still nitpicking and my co workers helping me out. I never got my hour break even though I worked seven hours. 
     Today: I went into work to find that my manager was off. I start working and find the day to be slow. The assistant manager gives me an hour break. When I come back she explains MY MANAGER STAYED HOME TO WATCH THE HOSTESS CAMERAS TO SEE IF I WOULD SLIP UP. Honestly I was surprised at first but then I thought that was not out of character. An hour later the assistant manager sent me home early since it was so slow.  
   So I guess my question is, can my manger do that? Is that even legal? What should I do? I‚Äôve been looking for another job but she‚Äôs horrible! No one at the restaurant likes her! I don‚Äôt want to leave everyone behind to deal with her! What‚Äôs my best course of action?

TLDR: my manager kept finding problems in the work I was doing and stayed home the next day to watch the cameras in an effort to catch me messing up."

I took the advice of a commentor and showed them my signed contract, which spelled out the benefits without referring to the document.

Basically, they just forgot to think that their actions may have an effect on existing employees. They figured out how to delay the implementation of the new rules so that the six people in probation would be through as promised on their contract. They actually thanked me for pointing it out to them.

Anyone use GoodHire for Credit Checks?,AskHR,3,cy1uep,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/cy1uep/anyone_use_goodhire_for_credit_checks/,3,1567318878.0,"Anyone have experience with GoodHire credit checks? I had an employer run one on me (they pulled Transunion) and every single one of my accounts for every payment I've made for the past 8 years came back as delinquent.

I have excellent credit and have never missed a payment. Problem is, GoodHire seems to think that a payment record of ""1"" means I've been 30 days late, ""2"" to mean 60 days late, ""3"" for 90 days late, etc. They only think a payment record of ""C"" means ""paid on time"".

I did a google search and even Transunion's own website says that a payment record of ""1"" is ""paid as agreed"". And yes, I pulled my own credit from Equifax, Transunion, and Experian and verified no derogatory credit at all.

This seems like a huge oversight on GoodHire's part. Did they just recently start doing credit checks? I can't imagine them making this big of a mistake and not fixing it. Literally every candidate would be coming back with a delinquent payment record.

Edit: this is in CA

\---

**Edit 2 (9/1)**: So I did some research and apparently GoodHire is using Experian payment codes to interpret a Transunion report.

Experian uses the following payment codes.

* ""C"" = Current/paid as agreed
* ""1"" = 30 days late

Transunion, on the other hand, uses the following:

* ""1"" = Current/paid as agreed
* ""2"" = 30 days late

So when they pulled my Transunion report, all of my accounts (which have always been paid on time) show correctly as ""11111..."" BUT since they're using Experian codes, they're flagging them all as delinquent.

Ugh...is this a temporary glitch for GoodHire? They seem to have amazing reviews online from employers, and surely I can't be the only one to have encountered this if they're using the wrong payment code to interpret credit reports."
Salary negotiation,AskHR,7,cxy78s,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/cxy78s/salary_negotiation/,2,1567301853.0," Hello,

I'm currently interning at a F500 company and I've been told several times that all my managers wanted me to stay FT at the end of my internship. Pretty much every week, they are asking me about it, if I made a choice, when I will make it etc... . My internship evaluation form even mentioned this in writing.

The other day, HR even asked me to come have a tchat about my career plan and possibly stay at the company. During this meeting, they told me that they were really interested in having me as a FT employee and that they were willing to give a competitive salary with respect to the market. Despite all this they said they couldn't give me a precise number, so I currently have no idea of the salary I could get there (They did say I would be getting much more than my current intern salary, but it's not like I'm being well paid as an intern either).

Now, during this meeting, they asked if I was interviewing elsewhere, which I am (couple of interviews scheduled in a few days). So HR ended abruptly the meeting and said that we should talk again next week after my interviews.

TBH, I was hoping that HR would give me a number that I could use as a reference to negotiate with the other companies I'm applying at, and to also show that my internship was successful enough for the company to offer a position at the end of it. On the other hand, I know how much they were willing to pay a former intern there that was offered a post-internship position, technically lower than what position they are telling me about. So I guess I can expect a little bit more than that.

There is this one company I'm interested in that seems to be ideal for me (project, team, commute, benefits) at which I applied and manage to get into the last step of the process (HR interview in a few days). What should I tell them if they ask me about my expected salary and if they asked me if I have other offer on the table ? Should I mention my situation with my current company, that they will give me their number once I'm done interviewing outside ? Or give them the amount the former intern told me about ? Or not even mention this at all ?"

I also have text evidence of her how to coach other co workers into getting someone that she hated terminated few months back and she is spiteful and vindictive. I really need help of how to protect myself plz.

Do ‚Äúinformal investigations‚Äù show up on your ‚Äúrecord‚Äù?,AskHR,3,cy0m2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/cy0m2c/do_informal_investigations_show_up_on_your_record/,2,1567312971.0,"UK üá¨üáß

I was bullied by a team member (TM), who shared the same line manager (LM) as myself.

I mentioned behaviour briefly (no details) but LM immediately cut short the conversation. 

LM went to HR. Said my ‚Äúaccusations‚Äù were cause for investigation. LM did not offer any options prior to going to HR eg counselling, mediation. Clearly wanted me out. Need to stress at this point LM was particularly aloof, cold, uninvolved, didn‚Äôt so much as look at me, let alone ask how I was, over the course of several months.

I was getting training and support from others around me. They supported me in small, meaningful ways, but could not do much about the bullying. My role was contract. TM was more than perm - someone with a 7+ year friendship with LM.

Still on probation, wanting the stress to stop, not wanting to be part of an investigation or continue the role, I gave notice. 

While serving my 4 week‚Äôs notice, an investigation WAS being carried out, however I had not been notified: no request to participate, no notice of time, place, proceedings.

On my last day I was shocked to find out an informal investigation had taken place, and to be sent ‚Äúfindings‚Äù. It denied all the bullying, of course. The next day, access to my work email was terminated, I no longer have the email trail.

My question: Will an informal investigation show up on my record? Is it something of concern for future references?

I have voice recordings of the bullying as TM was aggressive and I knew about two months in I needed to document it if I ever wanted to fight for the role. In the end I quit out of stress, but I have proof of the inaccuracy of the investigation, if I have to dispute it.

TL:DR I do not want to waste time disputing an ‚Äúinformal investigation‚Äù if it‚Äôs not something a future workplace may ever find out about."

"Light fire under employer's feet for delayed (""promised"") promotion",AskHR,0,cy4d55,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/cy4d55/light_fire_under_employers_feet_for_delayed/,2,1567332775.0,"I'm currently working in Toronto, Canada; as the highest-seniority engineer (""Senior Engineer IV"") in Canada for a large US-based engineering firm. I've been working with this company for about 2 years now, and basically put in obscene amounts of overtime (60 - 100+ hours per week), and helped save a project/product that nearly failed (millions of dollars would have been lost; my employer straight-up told me a lot was expected of me to help salvage the project when I started, and has since told me that I ""delivered"" on the expectations they had from me). My employer, as of 4 months ago, started assigning me even more complex work that involves researching industry standards and emerging technologies, managing people, and so on. I was told that I'm being put in the ""effective role"" of the most senior non-management role there is, ""Principal Engineer"". **This role pays nearly 1.5x my current role.**

&#x200B;

I just had my annual review, and was told I'm doing a great job in my new role, and I brought up the topic of ""that's great to hear! When will my remuneration reflect my new role?"". My manager, who's normally very upbeat, frowned a bit, and noted that nobody gets promoted within the company in under 4 years, especially for such an advanced role, but that at this rate, I would definitely be earning a Principal Engineer's salary when the 5 year mark hits. False modesty aside, I don't buy it: exceptions are made for exceptional circumstances, and being credited with being a major contributor to company success and already working in the capacity of a ""Principal Engineer"" seems more than reasonable enough justification for my promotion.

&#x200B;

**Question:**

I can find similarly paying work, but I'd like to stay on board with this company and see how far I can go with them, as the ""Principal Engineer"" position is a pathway to even higher pay in a senior management role, which eventually paves the way to becoming VP/exec level, etc. **My goal is to not burn up existing goodwill, and not to simply quit and job/ladder-hop. That being said, I'm willing to \*\*risk\*\* burning up goodwill and taking a job with another company if it's apparent the company is going to make me work in a role and wait 3 years to start (potentially) being paid appropriately (they can only burn up so much of \*\*my\*\* faith/trust too).**

&#x200B;

To the question: how can I light a fire under my employer's toes to make them reconsider, without having to threaten to leave and accept a counter offer? My stance is to never accept a counter offer, as the good will is already burned up (i.e. ""the well is poisoned""), and that promotion would be the last one I have with the company. My thoughts so far:

* Have a friend call my boss pretending to be a recruiter, asking for very minor information (i.e. did ""Mr. XYZ"" work here during this time period?): things that employers are often willing to share without being intrusive.
* There are a number of relevant industry certifications I could pick up within a couple weeks, and add to my LinkedIn profile (coworkers of mine are able to access my profile). I could just re-enable ""broadcast my updates to friends"", post it (which draws attention), and have a friend create a fake recruiter account and publicly try to reach out to me.
* Have a friend pretend to be a recruiter, call the front desk, and ask to be forwarded to me. It's not hard to automate this.
* Ask my employer for special dispensation (which the company allows) to run my own company (i.e. so I can provide volunteer/pro-bono services to charities that need my skills). I can just insist I need to incorporate for insurance and professional liability reasons. Right now I'm doing about 55 hours of work per week, and am happy to drop it down to an even 40 hours, and let them assume that formerly-free 15 hours per week (almost 3 per work day) is going somewhere other than their pockets.

I‚Äôm really excited about the position and I think it is exactly what I have been looking for. However I think I went too low on the salary. They asked during the interview and I said 80k minimum. After I said this I found out that the reason they are hiring is because they just had multiple engineers leave because they were offered jobs by one of their clients that is a startup and they could not match their offers so they are pretty eager to hire. 

My current salary is 75k with 5k bonuses every 6 months. Benefits are terrible, I like the people I work with, I have an office, I get to bring my dogs to work, I rarely have to work over 40 hours. 

My new offer is 83k, one additional week of vacation, better benefits, but depending on the projects I could be working longer hours, should average 45

I want the new job but I think I am in a good position to try to ask for a higher salary. I think something around 90k or did I screw myself by saying 80 during the interview?Should I negotiate over the phone or email them? Would it be better to ask for a specific number like 90k or ask for a 10% increase?"

It's a small firm, so in addition to my procedural legal work, my day-to-day tends to involve a good deal of CRM work which, as an empath, I actually really enjoy. And I'm good at it. I've consistently gotten positive feedback about my ability to create authentic relationships quickly---connecting with people just comes naturally to me. As a result, people kind of ask me out a lot. So long as people are respectful, it doesn't really bother me. I'm in a long-term relationship, so I usually just politely decline but thank them for flattering me. Which is exactly what I did last week when a client (technically former client) asked me out via email. It had been a couple of weeks since we filed the last pleading in his case, so we weren't actively representing him when he emailed me asking to take me out for wine. Again, I told him I was flattered but declined the offer. Now, normally I wouldn't have said anything about this at all, but this man was \~3x my age, so I was a little surprised. I told a colleague about this a couple days later, just to share my amazement, and we laughed the whole thing off together. I asked her not to share this with anyone, as I didn't want to embarrass the client or anything like that, and she assured me that she wouldn't think of it. 

Fast-forward two or three weeks, and my boss brings it up in one of our 1:1 meeting---so she definitely thought of it and shared information with my superior that I told her in confidence, as a friend and close colleague. My boss essentially blamed me for the incident (which I wasn't even offended or upset about), and told me that I am """"too nice"""" and I ""made a man three times my age think it was appropriate"" to ask me out. But when I pulled up all of the communication I had with the client and asked him to review it with me, he said he couldn't pinpoint it.

Calling out sick Question NJ,AskHR,4,cxtnd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/cxtnd2/calling_out_sick_question_nj/,6,1567269458.0,"So I am an office admin at my job currently. 
We have associates who will call because they are not feeling well/sick. Managers will request they bring a DR note or, it will be an improper call out and will be documented. 

Here is the thing though, it is not improper. The handbook states an associate must call out 2 hours prior to the shift and speak to a supervisor.  They will say to the associate that it is a popular weekend and it leaves us shorthanded so its improper. That is not what our policy says at all.  Is this even fair?
It says they will receive a Corrective action form after an excessive amount which management can decide. But one definitely is not excessive.

Also, Do they even have to get a DR note? 
One girl spent 30 dollars to go to an urgent care to learn she had strep which she already figured she had. Because a manager said if you don't get a doctors note you will be documented.

Anyway would love some clarity. Since I think it's totally unfair and I would like to stop it."

He stays in the same spot as i pass him, he is staring at me as i pass him turning to face me. I basically avoid as much eye contact as possible and go hide in a nearby office. 

Before i explain the 2nd part would that be considered sexual harassment or a mistake?


Now im in an office and i am reviewing video of the incident and it shows as im approaching the area him noticing me coming, him quickly walking to where im going to round the corner, is looking out for me to come through, doing a little dance might i add, as i come around the corner he removes his work shirt, whole time hes smiling ear to ear and staring at me as i walk past to the desk.

Unemployed soon,AskHR,2,cxoc2x,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/cxoc2x/unemployed_soon/,4,1567234891.0,"Hi all,

(Edited to include Washington as my location)

Looking for some help here. I don't know where else to go. Ill keep the backstory brief. Joined the Air Force out of high school, waited tables after getting out, had enough of that , got into and graduated a great public university in 2015. Started an internship in a the same city with county councilmember for a year.

&#x200B;

Worked with legislation, but didn't impress anyone enough, or was poorly directed and position not extended after a year. Unemployed for 3 months, got on with an other job in the same county as a TLT. Promoted within 6 months, but really didnt handle all the new financial responsibilities well and the training was non-existent. Fast forward 6 months, upper management had enough of my screw-ups, and transferred me to the team that actually works with the finance and payroll. Made a few more errors but eventually turned all the errors around and have been working here for a year now, still as TLT.

&#x200B;

See a FTE position open up for basically what I'm doing with one more duty. I apply and get scheduled for an interview. Have not taken vacation in over a year, yet interviews get scheduled the 5 days I'm supposed to be gone. I cancel vacation, do interview, take a financial test and get told ""I'm just not a good fit"". I get told I should've been job-shadowing all along with the county program. So I reach out to real estate and set up a meeting to work with them when I return from vacation. Director is super nice and tells me to touch base with him when I return.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to now  8 weeks later, finally back from the vacation I rescheduled and the person they hired started working here. Old boss that promoted me finally talks to me again and asks to have coffee sometime. (alarm bells go off).

&#x200B;

Today I get a meeting request with supervisor and director to tell me I will not be extended and HR will give me a letter letting me know when my last day is.

&#x200B;

Here are the only communications I've had with supervisors about my position:

Thank you for your patience while we sort out the HR logistics of your TLT position. As you know the TLT position you have been backfilling recently became vacant. Because of this change we needed to create a new TLT. You were placed in this new TLT position as of 10/8/18, with an estimated end date of 10/6/19. If anything changes regarding the end date, HR and/or your supervisor will discuss it with you immediately.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

&#x200B;

AND

As mentioned in our meeting, Tricia will provide the TLT notification letter with confirmed end day when Tony has signed it. In regards to your job shadowing with Michael in RES, it was not approved due to your approaching TLT‚Äôs status end date.

If you have any other questions in the future, please do not hesitate to let me or Tricia know.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now I have 4 sick days that will get paid out at like a quarter of time. What should I do? Please treat me like I'm 5.

&#x200B;

Yes, I've been applying for other jobs, but not as many as I should be. Some I haven't been invited to interview, others I haven heard anything back at all, good or bad news."
Why is my employer pushing back on my request for more vacation time?

From my recollection, I earned PTO after my first year at our company. After 6 years, we earn an extra 5 days. 

Yesterday, I requested a $2-3/hour raise (I have been at $17/hour since I began in 2017) and an extra 5 days of vacation. My boss‚Äô response to the request for a raise was very positive and she said I was definitely due for one. However, she basically said more vacation is not gonna happen, citing how my coworker only just got an extra week after being here 6 years.

Today, I followed up with an email reducing my request for increased pay in favor of the vacation. I did also mention my willingness to accept less pay for this extremely important (to me) benefit in yesterday‚Äôs conversation, but probably not clearly enough considering how adamant my boss was about my low chances of getting more vacation.

No response yet, but I don‚Äôt feel confident and am very disappointed already. Financially, I see the expenditure of increased vacation rather than pay as being less overall cost for them, so I don‚Äôt know exactly why I got so much push-back. 

Can anyone give me some insight here? Am I maybe missing some other deterring factor? Is this just not to upset my coworkers? I don‚Äôt work in HR so have no idea what goes on behind the scenes. 

Thanks in advance!

Edit: Why the downvoting? I‚Äôm asking this to better understand where my company is coming from.

UPDATE: I got the extra week AND a modest raise. Moral of the story - always ask for what you want!"

I had a phone screening with a recruiter last week. It was okay, I‚Äôm not really fond of phone interviews.

An hour after the interview, I received an email from the recruiter saying that the VP and Acctg manager were very pleased about the interview and she wants me to do a phone interview with the HR Director the next day. 

I was pretty confident, I thought it was just for formality so I didn‚Äôt prepare much. First, she was the most unenthusiastic interviewer I‚Äôve met.

They provide these notes to HR, HR gives the specific chair needed to me, and I order it, put it together (it almost always comes completely assembled) and then I give it to the employee.

Our chairs in the office are $800 ergonomic chairs, but for some reason, lots of people think we cheap out and want their own ""special"" chair. These are usually cheap $170 chairs on Amazon. The company pays for it, but I think that they think these chairs our better than ours, which is almost always not true.

Anyways, we have one specific employee who had us order some cheap $130 chair. I assembled it, and weeks later now it's already falling apart. It's just a cheap chair. However, this employee wants me to come by every single time the chair has something go wrong with it and ""fix"" it.

I'm curious, is this something we have to do as a company? We've already ordered and purchased the chair she had a doctor's note for. Are we required to also maintain this chair? 

I even mentioned to this employee that if she was annoyed with this happening all the time, she could have her doctor recommend a more expensive chair. We are a huge company, we can most definitely afford it and I want employees to be comfortable if they sit in a chair for 8+ hours a day.

It's extremely difficult for me to spend 30 minutes every other week trying to fix a $130 chair, though. Anyways, just curious, do we actually need to do this?

Thanks in advance. Located in Texas if that makes a difference."

I was underpaid by 1 overtime hour. I wasn't even told about it, I just noticed that my hours that I submitted and the hours on my paystub didn't match. I try to reach out to my boss about it via email, she says she doesn't remember specifically which hour I was docked and then deflects me to the tech guy, so he gives me the list of hours that I was approved for pay that week, which was useful for finding which hour was docked, but not for finding out why. So I sent my boss an email explaining the work I did that day and asked why I wasn't paid for an hour between one job and another (we're on the clock while driving by the way).

This email was sent the day before I went on vacation, so I sent it and then promptly forgot about it the following week. When I checked my email there was no response. So I finally talked to her in person and she essentially said ""it was a long time ago"" and ""I don't remember what the reason was"" and ""What is it, like $8? Get over it."" (This last was in a jokey tone, at least.) I neglected to point out that the ""just $8"" argument goes both ways - if it's so little then what is the issue with paying it? (And also no it is more than $8.)  Also, I was actually overpaid the week right after the week currently in question, and when I informed them I got an immediate response and it was taken care of very efficiently. And the issue in question happened a ""long time ago"" (a few weeks) because my queries kept ignored ignored.

Anyway, basically my boss eventually just said ""the discussion is over"" and something about having to get home to have a chandelier installed (not joking). Personally, I think the reason is that she messed up while adding up my hours and doesn't want to admit it. Who can I talk to about this since the ""discussion is over"" with my boss? Is this where HR comes in? Seems like a drastic step but I mean when you underpay someone and then stonewall them, what other option is there?

Also, yeah it's not a lot of money, it's more the idea of getting denied an hour without being told. Another option is to let it go for now so as to avoid rocking the boat, and then only speak up if it happens a second time. What do you guys suggest?

1) Is that a circumstance of my termination? I'm wondering if that policy would still apply if I had left that job willingly.

2) As I've worried in the past, my industry is quite small and a lot of people know each other. Is this a matter of a policy that exists formally, but difficult to enforce because people talk?

How to deal with difficult employee who constantly challenges my management?,AskHR,8,cwr4tt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/cwr4tt/how_to_deal_with_difficult_employee_who/,11,1567056365.0,"Location: UK

I manage a difficult employee who has severe anxiety issues and frequently criticises management of our small company or my management of them. They typically don‚Äôt challenge directly but will say snarky, non-direct comments which are incredibly annoying. Based off the discussions they have with me, they enjoy see others around them fail to elevate their own confidence. 

It‚Äôs gotten to a point where I hate holding performance review meetings with this person as they tend to use my feedback as an opportunity to see fault or disagree with my feedback. Despite them being a poor performing employee (soft skill wise) outside of being able to perform their core function, they‚Äôre unable or unwilling to improve them self. 

To make matters worse, I see their toxic /. gossipy attitude as wearing off on others. 

Unfortunately, despite this employee being very difficult to have in the office, they produce a good amount of revenue for the office. Getting rid of them would be difficult as our company is very specialist so they‚Äôd be difficult to replace.

I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm looking for advice, more just support. I‚Äôm completely, emotionally exhausted from dealing with this employee and wish I didn‚Äôt have the responsibility of overseeing them."

I am a very nervous person and I‚Äôve been previously diagnosed with anxiety so this was a very very uncomfortable situation for me. The loss prevention officer was making me go through store policy and basically led the conversation into how have I made the store lose money. I was crying and telling him I don‚Äôt know and I ended up admitting to things I haven‚Äôt done. I told him I‚Äôve returned items without receipts (against policy) even though i never have. I told him I might have eaten some food without paying even though every time i buy food i staple my receipt to it. I told him my boyfriend has given me money to buy cloths for myself and i use my employee discount for it (not against store policy but he manipulated it into me saying i‚Äôve used other people‚Äôs money to buy cloths with my discount for them). The worst one was I told him that if I have a really nice customer i‚Äôll give them an active coupon. I made it clear that i‚Äôve only done it a couple times. He asked me what the amount saved averaged to per transaction and I said $5-$10 and he told me that the most recent coupon was for $15 so to just average it out to $15. He then did the math and basically said if I do it 3 times a week for the past 7 months i‚Äôve been working there I‚Äôd owe the store $1260. He then told me to write a statement on what happened. Every step of the way he was telling me what to write and even made me make sure i scratched out the $5-$10 and write $15. He told me to write that he was kind and courteous and that i‚Äôm willing to pay back the company. he then told me to sign a paper saying I‚Äôll pay back the company.

Independent Contractor or Employee,AskHR,13,cwmnva,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/cwmnva/independent_contractor_or_employee/,6,1567036355.0,"Sorry for the wall of text!  I am in Illinois, USA.

I was doing some freelance marketing work for my current boss for a few months before he offered my a part time, hourly position in the company. I was only looking for freelance work to make extra money on the side while I looked for a new full time job, he was my only client. My first day working for him he had me fill out a W9 form, so he didn‚Äôt take taxes out of my paycheck (only been one so far). I also never filled out a contract (silly, I know. I blame myself for being desperate for income).

Would this mean I am being classified as an independent contractor instead of an employee? He has had me come in three full days a week with an unpaid 30 min lunch break, and I have just been writing blogs, writing all the copy for a new website launch, writing sales sheets, presentations, etc. To me this would make me an employee instead of a contractor. 

I have also found out that any non-salaried employee is being treated the same way (graphic designer, social media manager, sales people) who are all full time.  He also sent an email out last week pitching the new ‚Äúprofit sharing‚Äù program and said that ‚Äúactive employees‚Äù are eligible. The email also reiterated that we work ‚Äúsummer working hours with only  a 30 min paid lunch.‚Äù He does have a history of not paying full paychecks unless you call him out. 

I did email him in regards to the lunches and employment classification. He just ignored it. I was trying to keep what he says documented, but it looks like I will have to have an in-person conversation. 

I'm fine with being a contractor, but  I would like to be treated as such. I am also fine being an employee, but would like to be treated as such. What should I do? Am I in the wrong? Not only is he saving money by keeping us as contractors instead of employees, he isn‚Äôt paying us for that 30 min lunch either. Will having this conversation with him result in him firing me?

I'm preparing my coming interview with HR and I'm wondering if my answer to this question is acceptable.

I'm applying for a junior role, but I know they are also recruiting senior/field expert at the same time. I know it because the job posting is basically the same except for the requirement and instead of ""help"" it's ""lead"". The job ads for the senior role also adds that he will rely on a junior in his daily task. I'm assuming they are referring to the role I'm applying to. I'm thinking of telling them I want to work there because I saw the senior job posting and I was entertaining the idea that this could be an opportunity for me to learn from experts. I'm thinking of saying something along the lines of the fact that I like that they are investing in ressources to do stuff.

Is it a reasonable thing to say ?

PS: I applied several months ago, and back then they had the 2 job ads (junior and senior) up at the same time. Both of them was removed 2-3 weeks later. Now I realized they reposted the senior ad, but not the junior ad (I guess that's a good thing for me). Would it be reasonable to ask HR how is the search going for the senior role ?"

Management issues and job transfers,AskHR,3,cwnudr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/cwnudr/management_issues_and_job_transfers/,8,1567041646.0,"US Missouri

Hey guys,

So I had a manager that lied multiple times on my review here recently. I had evidence and proof that what she was saying in my review was wrong in email form that was pretty much black and white, example: ""She said a project got delayed because I told a team member to not do X, when in email she was the one that told that employee not to do X"".

I went through HR and they agreed to update my review, this time however the 2nd revision of the review didn't have anything removed, but instead had justification for why the false statements where made, backing her claim that they are real instances with more lies that I could also prove where wrong just by simply printing off her emails. It was as if she didn't even check her emails to make sure she wasn't making stuff up.

Her superior wouldn't take the time to go over what I had until eventually, after about 100 days of working with HR I was finally able to present to him. After some debate between HR, her superior and myself, her superior finally agreed to remove everything that I had proven to be false. 

Obviously I asked for an immediate transfer as I do not want to work under someone who would do this on my review. I have been with this company for 9 years and have never had any complaints against myself or against anyone else and have a track record of only very highly rated reviews throughout my entire career.

Here a few weeks after everything has wrapped up on the review side, my managers supervisor came in and told me that my only option to be transferred is to take a demotion from my current job (Salary, EEO professional, masters degree required) to a technician(Hourly, EEO Technician, GED or Vocational school require) job. Keeping my current pay but as an hourly employee, under a new direct report but same higher up manager(who was a large part of the problem). 

He claims that this is a lateral equivalent transfer, but nothing about this is equivalent. 

I am already applying elsewhere, but do I have any other moves I can make here? Another employee just a few months ago had an issue with this same manager and they transferred her out immediately to the same position under a new group. 

**Tl;DR:** Management lied on a review, got caught, changed the review and offered me a demotion to get out from under my current direct report, claiming that it is a 1:1 equivalent job which it is clearly not."

I have kind of a tricky situation I am in regarding my job hunt as a recent graduate. Basically I accepted a job offer and am set to start this Tuesday (Sep 3) and am currently interviewing with another company which would be a better job/ company. I told the Company Y during the screening phone call on 8/15 that I currently have 2 job offers, one being from Company X. She said that is fine and to let her know if anything changes. I then go on vacation the next week from Aug 17-24 and confirm the next interview at Company Y. Also during that week on Friday I accept the offer from Company X and decline the offer from another company. Now I have an in person interview 8/27 and it goes pretty well with Company Y. So today the recruiter reached out to me looking to set up a phone interview with the hiring manager. I told her I was free the rest of the week, but this would not work for them. She is now asking me to give a couple of times/ dates for next week. My start date for Company X is Sep 3 at 9 am and I am unsure of my work hours and when I take lunch so I couldn't really give her a time. I told her I would be available 8-8:30 am on Sep 3, but that was all. How should I approach this situation if I would much rather work at Company Y than Company X. Should I tell the recruiter at Company X my situation ASAP and be transparent. Or should I stall till late next week and gauge times I would be free for an interview??

Reporting harassment,AskHR,2,cwnv8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/cwnv8k/reporting_harassment/,17,1567041742.0,"Hi guys,

I was wondering if anyone has experience with reporting harassment, especially when it comes to any of the big tech companies' 'integrity line'. I'm slightly concerned with the experience I've had, but I don't know if it is just me.

Earlier this year I was harassed by my boss.

I've reported the issue a month ago, and left my number, asking for someone to call back. It took them about a week to leave a message with the call center. In the message, they asked for my phone number. I gave the number again.

A week later, a representative called. He asked me to explain what happened, but then immediately asked for the details of the person involved. He then asked questions I did not know how to answer - one was why I thought the person I'm complaining against decided to harass me.

The call ended with very little details of the story provided, but he then explained that he would need to decide on the person who would own the case from this point and on. I asked that specific people would be excluded from investigating, because I've complained before and they took no actions.

He then said he would need to speak to his manager about it, but made no commitment to call back or let me know what the next actions are.

I waited a few days and then left a message on his voicemail, just asking for a quick update if there is any. He never called. I waited a few more days and called again, only to be redirected to his voicemail. I thought he was busy. I tried again after a day or two, and got the same voicemail.

I got slightly suspicious, probably because I saw my complaint being ignored in the past, and I called from a a using Google phone. Calling over and over was not cheap (the number is in the US and I'm overseas )number. Interestingly, he picked up the phone right away. He seemed annoyed and directly asked me why I called from a different number.

When I asked for an update, he told me he asked someone else to look after the case - sadly, someone I asked to be excluded from the the investigation in our first conversation. 

I was upset about the whole thing and the pressure was building up, and I got frustrated. I then asked him to let someone else investigate, and keep the communication open. All I needed him to do is call and update, unless someone else picked the case up, and that of course, let someone neutral investigate, rather than someone I have complained about. 

He seemed to have hung up as I was speaking. Maybe he had an urgent call.. I don't know, but it didn't feel nice.

Since then, it's now been a month since my original submission, and about a week since I've last spoken to the man, no one has contacted. I left a message today.

Maybe I'm too stressed out (because of what happened) or maybe this is just the standard process, or maybe I am being put in the dark, so any constructive thoughts or comments, would be appreciated"

Job title: HR Admin Assistant

Hello HR world! I am currently an HR Admin Assistant, but have come to the conclusion the HR world may not be for me. Before being hired into my HR role, I was with the same company for two years in a client facing role. That role was my first job out of school and I have been a professional for less than five years. I like my company and I have close to reaching 100% vesting on my retirement plan so staying with them would be ideal. My question for the subreddit is would it be inappropriate/a no go to apply to and  move to another position in the company after being a part of HR? My degree is in Business Administration and I have no formal HR education. The plan was to learn on the job and go to seminars and conferences to learn laws, benefits, etc.

Can I get in trouble for speaking about an HR investigation over a year later and after I am no longer at the company,AskHR,40,cwby5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/cwby5f/can_i_get_in_trouble_for_speaking_about_an_hr/,19,1566974899.0," 

A year and a half ago I was fairly new to my company and discovered some wrongdoing by a senior employee who happened to be best friends with my boss. He had access to the back end of the company website and had changed legitimate links all over the site to links to his own website that sells products in the same niche as the company. I found out because I was working on the website, found thousands of links all over the place to this one site (I thought we had been hacked) and then researched who/where the domain was registered to. I also found lots of information about this guys other company. It appeared that this guy was likely stealing materials for his business as well.¬† ¬†I had only been at the company a few months at this time.¬†

I gathered up all the necessary information, and spoke with HR about everything I found. They told me they were opening an official investigation.¬†

The said if I said a word about this to anyone I'd be fired.¬†

The boss told me that day he didn't believe this person would do such a thing and there must be a valid reason why his friend was doing this. I said this is theft, he is piggybacking on our site's SEO and it's also an attempt to redirect our web traffic to his website.¬†

Long story short, I was punished by being locked out of the website for months so I was unable to do my job. The employee was not fired. In fact, he was asked by the boss to continue to be involved in the website. It was very strange.¬†

I had to continue to make up reasons as to why I was unable to access the website.¬†

Later my boss told me that he contacted a web company who was able to remove the links and put everything back to normal so it was ""no harm no foul""

My boss never trusted me after that and I often suspected that he thought I was somehow responsible or that I attempted to frame this employee.¬† HR told me that there were thousands of links on the website and when they had the website analyzed they found they were placed there over the course of several years so it couldn't have been me.¬†

I recently got a new job - now a year and a half after this incident. In my exit interview I spoke to HR about it and they told me that the owner of the company told them not to fire that guy, but they said that they didn't think he had all the relevant information and didn't seem to understand what had happened. The owner, if it matters, is an elderly man who doesn't understand computers, although it seems to me that maybe my boss left some information out on purpose. 

Anyway, I finally told my counterpart at our sister company after I was gone.¬†

Now I'm a little worried. If they speak about it to anyone it might get around to people at my company and then HR/ex-boss will probably know I had told them.¬†

I‚Äôm salary, non-exempt, and accrue Company-sponsored vacation My regular shift is Monday through Friday and boss is super duper strict with overtime.

Have a big project presentation coming up that happens to take place the Saturday following Labor Day.  Even though it‚Äôs my off day, I of course know I need to be there.  No issues there. 

 The boss, however, is telling me that in order to avoid overtime, I have to submit a vacation day for Labor Day... so that I can then work 40 hours (including the presentation) without accruing overtime. The office is technically open on Labor Day, and is technically open on all holidays, though it‚Äôs a skeleton crew. Everyone is normally given the option of working a holiday (if it falls during their regular work schedule), or taking the day off with a vacation day submitted... but I‚Äôve never encountered forcing people to take a vacation day... especially as an ends to get 40 hours out of them somewhere else. In this case, I‚Äôm being forced to use a vacation day, and work a 40-hour week.

I know at-will, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre free to ignore and they‚Äôre free to fire you‚Äù, blah blah blah, but: am I crazy to think this is, well crazy? To be expected to basically donate a vacation day so that I can work 40-hour week without costing the company any extra overtime pay?

To give you some context, I'm currently enrolled in 2 master programs (one in applied maths and one in data science) in parallel. So far, I have passed all the required exams for both masters (tbh it was challenging, a lot of night and week end studies to catch up classes I've missed because of the mismatch schedules).

One of my master requires me to complete an internship, which I'm currently doing, and to write a report on the internship. The other master requires me to write a research thesis. Meanwhile, I started applying about 2 months ago to look for a job after graduating. At that time, I was pretty confident about completing both my masters, so I put both of them on my resume with the expected graduation date (this september).

However, despite my efforts, I can't say I'm happy with the way my master thesis turned out, and I know my supervisor to be pretty strict in terms of grading. It is probable that I end up failing my master thesis. On the other hand, my internship went really well, and I do believe I have a really good internship report, and it is very unlikely that I do not end up graduating for this master. Tbh, I do not really care about the research master; it is from a much lesser known university than my other master.

The thing is, I've been invited for a last HR interview after passing all the previous technical interview. Should I let them know I might not graduate from one of my master ?"

The paralegal at the firm has been monster towards me the last few months. In email chains she with me cc'd in things such as this ""I have an assistant who's been more of a noose around my neck then a help."", I have saved these examples screen shot etc. so I can have to show. She will call me into her office to yell and belittle me that I am stupid, and probably not all there in the head. Regardless, of the meetings I have with the attorney to see where she can help with this issue, she does nothing it's like entertainment for the office.

This morning I came into work with every intention to catch up on work from Friday afternoon and Monday's work by putting aside my own health issues.¬† I had already been responding to emails when I received a phone call from my mother advising me that my youngest son had become increasingly sicker whom advised me to call the school to inform them of his absence for today. There is an illness spreading around my area, which has affected not only my son but myself included.¬† Saturday evening is when I began to succumb to the aforementioned illness but wasn‚Äôt noticeable until Sunday morning,¬† I had sent a group text advising them of my pending absence.¬†¬†This morning,  the paralegal came into my portion of the office, approached me, and stated,‚ÄúYou need to get a grip on f\*\*\*\*\*\* reality, grow up and stop letting outside distractions bother you.¬† That is why you have a mom to watch your kids while you work‚Äù

She then proceeded to question the legitimacy of my fever/illness and went as far as inquiring about the whereabouts of my thermometer and why I had not brought one into work.¬† She then approached me, physically grabbed my left arm and began to push her left forearm against my forehead to feel my head which resulted in pushing me back into my chair.¬† Not once had I consented to these actions whatsoever, nor have I ever been encroached upon in such a manner in my entire working professional life.¬† She then proceeded to leave my area of the office and head towards the front to begin joking about what had transpired.¬† I am beyond flabbergasted by all of these actions that have transpired over the past year and cannot put into words how unprofessional these interactions have increasingly become at the expensive of my reputation and views.¬†¬† I put my own personal feelings aside and made the effort regardless of how I felt this morning to drive in traffic to get to work and do the tasks I am given. I did not come into work with the intention of being physically or verbally assault, which despite my pleas and endless meetings, has become increasingly worse.

**TLDR** ‚Ä¢increasingly toxic work environment with one employee ‚Ä¢Employer does not help with the issues ‚Ä¢was physically grabbed in attempt to see if I had a temperature, when asked if I brought in my thermometer ‚Ä¢was told to leave since I was a liability on getting everyone else sick, even though I was told the day before I had to come into work

UPDATE: Ever since I made the report to the office, it took them from the Tuesday I emailed them about the incident, till Friday that week to tell me they are looking into the incident. The last three weeks were hell in that office, daily I was under attack by that lady verbally and by email. She looked for any little thing that I messed up on, and was quick to call me out on. This week I worked and was productive I prepared notebooks for all depositions that will happen till the end of the year. Friday,  with 10 mins left until 5pm I was called into a conference room and told that I was being let go due to my work production and my inability to work with that lady who had assaulted me. They gave me a choice to submit my resignation by Monday, if do not then they have no choice but to let other potential employers know why I was let go.  What can I do? I am upset because the person who assaulted me is the reason I was let go.  Also, my phone was connected to their wifi, and through that they said they had access to see my messages and they could see my communication that I had through my google hangouts, and they said they saw some ""vulgar language"" that I had said.

FMLA Question in KY,AskHR,2,cwfml7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/cwfml7/fmla_question_in_ky/,17,1566993859.0,"I have been approved for 12 weeks FMLA and it‚Äôs taken intermittently. I don‚Äôt believe my HR department are calculating things right. They keep throwing around the 480 hrs which I think most people who have read up on FMLA leave knows that 480 hrs is not how it is to be referred to. I understand where they get it from. But it‚Äôs not 480 hrs, it‚Äôs 12 **WORK WEEKS**!!!! Which is where my questioning comes in (and they really hate it when I question them on their authority on matters like this). I just went through the last years worth of work schedule, and out of 365 days, I was scheduled off 27 of them. Meaning I either had to work or use FMLA. I may be generous in counting the time off for holidays, but I am not sure on that. So, by using my mathematical skills, I come to the calculation that my work week is 6.5 days. For simplicity (and because I wouldn‚Äôt know how to make 6.5 a fraction anyways) let‚Äôs drop it down to a 6 day work week. Using those figures, I am allowed (12x6=) 576 hrs or 72 days, how ever you want to write it. Am I looking at this the right way? If I am not, I would appreciate it if someone would tell me I am a dumbass and that I am figuring it wrong and reading the wording in the FMLA laws wrong. Thanks for any help.

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-**

Edit- to try and be more clear and give more information. 

I have worked at this company for about 27 months now. When I had been there a full year and was eligible for FMLA, I filled out the paperwork and had my doctor fill out her part. It was approved for 12 weeks and after going through the company‚Äôs legal department, it was also classified as Permanent. I have been on FMLA for just over a year. I have already went through the recertification process for the second year. I am a disabled veteran with service connected disability rated at 90% by the VA. My disability has to do with my legs and being able to move around and so on (if it would help I can explain in more detail the disability) and as of right now, I take my FMLA leave intermittently. My paperwork from my Dr. explains that it is unknown really as to how often my ‚Äúflare ups‚Äù can occur and gave the estimation that the flare ups normally occur 4-6 times a month and each flare up could last for as long as 3 days at a time. My company uses a rolling calendar to keep track of hours used. I am sorry if that isn‚Äôt the right term, but here is an example of how it works (dates and numbers are only for the example): FMLA year started June 1 and I have a beginning balance of 480 hrs of FMLA leave. If I take a full day of FMLA leave on June 3, 2018 then 8 hrs is deducted from the leave balance and it now becomes 472 hrs, so on and so forth. When June 3, 2019 comes around, those 8 hrs that were took on June 3, 2018 would be added back on to the balance of FMLA leave at that time. If my balance was at 2 hrs on June 2, 2019 then my balance would go up to 10 hrs available FMLA leave time. 

Like I mentioned in a reply, my shift works a lot of hours every week all year round. We don‚Äôt have a normal weekly work schedule like most people do. We have a start time (11:00 p.m.) and a minimum quit time (7:30 a.m.) with a 30 min. unpaid lunch totaling 8 hrs, but if the task your working on is not complete when your 8 hrs is up, then you stay and finish it. We don‚Äôt have set days off. If we are not told directly and specifically that we are off, then we are expected to be at work. During my first year here, we went a span of 74 days straight without a single day off. Took one night off and went another 41 days straight. We were very short-handed at that time but now it has gotten better. If we want a day off, we can ask our supervisor and he almost always approves it. But it is limited to one day per week. If there is a big project then, no it will not be approved. Now I may be completely off in my calculations, as I have just recently started my second year, I had a print out of my previous 365 day attendance. Each and every single day showing Time In/Time Out, if it was a scheduled day off the line out be blank, if FMLA was used it would be listed. I went through and counted every scheduled day off for the year (I also included the days we were off for Federal Holiday‚Äôs not sure if that was right to do) and this is where I came up with the numbers I did in my original post. I had a total of 27 scheduled days off. I subtracted 27 from 365 and divided that total by 52 which gave me exactly 6.5. We have never worked a shorter day then 8 hrs. Never. So the total hours worked will actually be considerably higher then using the number of days my average work week come out to. The yearly hours totaled 2,704 hrs worked. A person working a normal job at 40 hrs a week has a yearly total hrs worked of 2,080. 
I know I don‚Äôt get more weeks, and if that‚Äôs how it come across, I apologize. What I am saying is because my scheduled work week has more hours then the normal job, I believe I am entitled to more hours per week. I still get 12 weeks, but each week should consist of 52 hrs, not the 40 that is being given. And under 29 CFR 825.205.b-c to the best of my understanding, states just that. 

Like another Redditor has pointed out, one thing that I have never been accused of is being the sharpest tool in the shed, and I would have to agree with them. And that‚Äôs why I came here to hopefully get a better understanding of what is going on with my situation. Look, you may be a very honest by the book type of person that gives their employees what is required, even if that employee would never know it if they were receiving less. But that doesn‚Äôt mean every HR person has the same moral compass. I envy those who are able to work for a company that has an ethical HR department. There are a lot of us who work at places that you have to request certain entitlements, even push or demand them at times. And there are those of us who are not as smart and have difficulty comprehending things like this, so we have put our trust in the HR department. It isn‚Äôt easy to ask for help when it shows how low our intelligence level is and makes out shortcomings obvious. I am at a point in my life that if I can help the people I work with also understand their rights and what they are entitled to, the embarrassment of my shortcomings being on display for all to see (and one to take little potshots at) then that‚Äôs what I am more then willing to do. 

Hopefully I have given enough information this time around. This is everything that I can possibly think of that pertains to my situation.  Thank you to all of you who has took time to reply and try to help."

I work in quite a large company. 30000 plus people work for them.

Basically for the past few months I have been dealing with a nightmare of a manager who has been makeing up lies about me and has been trying to get me to quite my job. 

Some of things include contacting me while I am hoildays asking me to do stuff when I am a 12 hour flight from the office. 

Insulting the work I do in front of Co workers. Saying I am only good for basic work and no good for proper work. 

Makeing out that I am a bully and supporting the guy who said I was a bully. It was proven I was not a bully but some how my manager is now lying saying it was never bullying that the Co worker reported me for. My reply is explain why I was told countless times in the meetings with hr that I am a bully and i am braking company policy. 

Asked my manager 3 times is it OK for me to speak at a conference that I was invited to speak at in front of over 1000 people (this is about my job so I can't be that bad) he never replayed so I ask his manager and my manager calls me into a meeting room and starts sreaming at me with bad language over doing this. My reply was so my Co worker gets to speak at two conferences but I can't speak at one?. His language got worse and his behavior got so bad I had to run out of the room as I tought he was going to hit me. 

He talks behind my back all the time about me. I have cought him doing this. 

Some of the lies he makes up include me fighting with Co workers who I never met in my life in different country's. He also says i said things in emails that I never said and have proved to him countless times that I never said it. 

When I reported him to hr I was put on a action plan?. When I told I was not happy over this and that the company is supporting a bully hr closed the case and won't speak to me about this. 

Does not support me on any ideas I might have and basically tells me to drop them and let my Co workers have the ideas. These include ideas that save mils for the company with simple changes. 

He says to me all the issues are in my head and that I am makeing everything up. But I am not. As another Co workers is in and out with hr over him as well. 

The same guy is sleeping with a Co worker who's reporting into him and to make it worse he is married. Going on 3 hour lunchs. Bought a major case in the office over woman getting car parking spaces. Comes to work hung over daily. 

Yet I am told I am the bad one.... 

I could go on for hours on this saddly 

What can i do about this?. As I can't work with this guy anyone. 

Thank you"

He was very drunk and when he saw me he said several racist statements and remarks about me, calling me racial slurs. I told him to stop and he asked to fight me. At that point I left. 

When I came into work a few days later, I mentioned this story to a few people in my office. I didn't think much of it other than ""wow I'm going to stay away from this guy he's pretty racist"" and I didn't approach HR because this happened outside of work.

The first time I saw him at work again, he approached me and said I can't be saying that he's a racist. I replied that he had been extremely racist to me, to the point of threatening to fight me when I told him to stop.

He said ""So what? You ARE a fucking ***** I can call you that.""

I approached HR about this, and I was told that although they would do a investigation, he had already filed a harassment case against me since I had ""brought it into work"" and had let others know about his racist behavior.

I'm pretty shocked that he can do this. Should I be afraid? I don't think I did anything wrong and I didn't think I was harassing him. I didn't even speak to him until he approached me, I had merely told others in my department what happened on my day off.

Frustratingly lazy manger affecting my job...advice?,AskHR,3,cw517l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/cw517l/frustratingly_lazy_manger_affecting_my_jobadvice/,2,1566944033.0,"EDIT LOCATION: Maine, USA (me), and Seattle, WA (person in question i think)

I'm a finance specialist, in charge of paying invoices, tracking credits and additional charges, accruals, budgets, overhead and favorability research and other money related things in a large international corporation.

i'm an outlier in the department; the way it works is there is a manager-->regional manager-->area supervisors-->dispatchers and somewhere on the side is me. the people i have to ask questions of are the supervisors and the regional managers. they're not in charge of the money anymore, but they do manage the operations (running the routes, the drivers, the market coverage etc.) none of that comes to my ears until they're set in stone and up and running because that's when it affects the wallet.

this one manger for the last 3 months has not done his job. examples:

there was an occasion we needed to figure out why one of his markets was coming in very low compared to our expected cost month over month. we couldn't find a cause in the system, accruals, anywhere. we figured look at the other side and see if maybe the expected amount is what's wrong, meaning something about the 2019 budget wasn't quite right. i email him to ask for the 2019 budget because the only one in his folder has 2017 dates in it and isn't even completed. the response i got was 'well i don't look at overheads, i don't know why you would be. but ask so-and-so if it's that important.' my manager and i do the overheads... i basically had to figure out the problem from memory and cobbling together an old budget from before i was even hired.

he set up a new vendor in one of his markets, but neglected to provide myself and my manager a billing contact, a sample invoice, a start date, a cost/day, and when the invoices started coming in to him instead of me because he didn't provide my contact info to the vendor, he just held onto them. didn't try and submit them, didn't forward them to anyone, let them sit in his inbox. we asked for a contact for the vendor and/or any documents for 6 weeks, and when we found out he had them still had to ask him to forward them 2-3 times before he did. the contact for the vendor came from the PDFs. this guy hasn't received invoices or been responsible for them in over 2 years, he knows what to do with them if he gets them.

budgets for 2020 are due 9/9.  normally each manager does their own. it's time consuming. now i'm here, i populated 95% of these budgets for them. their only responsibility was to add/subtract costs that were expected to begin/end in the next 4 months. things i don't know because they're not a real cost yet. he had 2.5 weeks, due to me yesterday to finalize. i find out he's on PTO in hawaii and didn't turn them in to anyone. ask my boss what we're supposed to do because when he gets back it'll basically be too late to get them in on time. my boss was told to do the budget for this guy in all his spare time (my boss usually has 40-50 'spare time' projects which unfortunately we can't share). it's not even my boss' market, so he doesn't know all the plans upcoming...

3 months ago, we decided to discontinue with a vendor. around that time, the vendor went through an acquisition, so the name and banking info changed. we need to set up a new vendor in our system to pay the final invoices. i cannot do this because A) not my purview and B) i don't know enough about those forms to fill them out. i did get the ACH and W9 documents for him, and let him know we needed a vendor created. i asked him 5 times, no response. vendor service stops, i ask again whether this is done, his response is to ask if we can cut a manual check without doing a new vendor account (so a check with no paper trail...).  i had AP explain why we can't do that and need a vendor account set up. he still did nothing. so i did it, and after fixing about a million mistakes i made it got done, but i got a lot of tsk tsk from the AP manager about how overdue the invoices were.

this is just the last couple weeks. there are tons of examples over the year i've been here, but basically it's gotten worse. the manager for our entire dept doesn't want to do anything about anything. he's the kind of person who calls chasing after an $8k billing error as ""nickel and diming"" the vendor, if that gives you an idea. he excuses incompetence by saying 'it's hard to remember things'.

the guy isn't grossly incompetent, necessarily, but he is grossly lazy and the longer time goes on the worse it is. i heard rumors he has been going through some personal things, but even so...advice please? i've just had enough. his failure to do *his* work is affecting my ability to do *my* work. is there anything i can do? anyone i could go to anonymously? would anyone give a damn?"

I‚Äôll be leaving my current job in a few weeks and I‚Äôm excited for the next phase of my life.

Currently I work in a corporate headquarters that likes to talk of responsibility, ownership, communication, respect etc. I‚Äôm in my late 40‚Äôs and these are all things that I believe too. I was taught that you work hard and tow the company line. I‚Äôm not infallible and occasionally I fall short of my personal expectations and that of my companies. It‚Äôs not for a lack of trying or effort its just a you win some/you lose some kind of thing.

Anyway, we have been asked many time, even as recent as 2 weeks ago to make sure that you are working hard, don‚Äôt surf on the web, no personal reading, stay off of your phone, don‚Äôt do homework at your desk, keep the talking down etc., (you get the idea) while you are supposed to be working. Breaks and lunch time we can go ahead and do what we like as long as its respectful, low noise and not disruptive. Again, how an office should be. I'm all for having a little fun but when its appropriate. 

What happens is however, the complete opposite, planning of Halloween contests, literally 2 hours talks over the tops of cubicles about whatever TV show was on last night. People on FB, watching Netflix, reading, doing their nails, talking about their latest romantic escapade, etc, etc. Its like working in a middle school playground sometimes. 

This is one of the main reasons I‚Äòm leaving, along with I need a new challenge I‚Äôm basically an order entry person. I‚Äôve tried to post out but I‚Äôve not been successful and I‚Äôve seen others who are less qualified, no degrees, poor performance get jobs I‚Äôve applied for. While I‚Äôm disappointed and to a degree hurt, I accepted it and moved on doing what I‚Äôve been hired to do. It appears that the workhorses of the company stay put and don‚Äôt get to advance. While the less dedicated move on to better paying roles yet don‚Äôt really do much as their work generally comes back to the folks that were passed over.

My question is this, is it worth politely mentioning any of my observations (others also have expressed the above to me as well) and feelings to management/HR ‚Äúif‚Äù I even get an exit interview? Or, should I just thank them for the opportunity and move on. My spouse also works here and I don‚Äôt want any blow back to come their way.

Recently employees from other teams have started sitting in this area due to available seating. They are opposed to the lights and will turn them on right after they are turned off. 

An argument I've recently heard is this constitutes as a fire hazard violation. I can confirm the area where my team resides has multiple lit fire exit signs while the overhead lights are off and the lights over the snack bar/coffee area stay illuminated while the overhead lights are off.

How to disclose a romantic relationship with a coworker to our superior?,AskHR,13,cvssbu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/cvssbu/how_to_disclose_a_romantic_relationship_with_a/,3,1566876428.0,"I work for a company in Massachusetts. 

Over the course of the summer my coworker and I have begun a romantic relationship that has become much more serious and committed than we originally anticipated. We held off on informing our superior until we figured out the depth of the relationship.

Our company does not have an official HR department, but rather any HR related complaints are handled by our managers or Executive Director, and if there are any issues related to the Executive Director then there is a staff liaison to the board of directors available to hear those grievances.

The issue we are posed with is our individual positions in the company; she is technically in a position higher than myself. However, her position isn't directly superior to mine (has no say in my evaluations). She is not a manager but instead focuses on community outreach to work with families of our students and as a result holds an administrative role in the company. She only employees she evaluates are high school students who work for us part-time. Her only direct superior is the executive director, where as my superior is one of our managers.

We are unsure of how public we plan to make our relationship to our coworkers (the company culture is very close-knit and much of our staff have enriching friendships and community ties with each other), but are fairly sure that we need to notify our Executive Director of the relationship. The company has no policy regarding employee relationships and there are a few examples of employees dating each other and it working out quite well - for example my manager is married to an employee with the same position as myself, but they were dating before she was promoted.

We are not particularly concerned with any disciplinary issues, especially because we each have strong professional and personal relationships with our Executive Director and are confident that our relationship will have no impact on our demonstrably strong job performance. We are more concerned with any perceived conflict of interest or special treatment coming up from other employees.

I am curious if there are any potential issues to think about and concern ourselves with before holding this meeting with our ED? Any insight or advice is much appreciated!"

I started at this company a year ago. It's a peat control company. When I first started I was hired as reception and general admin, but that progressed into managing a set of clients with a particular product. About a month ago, a coworker left, and I took on her role, managing the admin for the construction side of the business in addition to the work I was already doing. Someone else was hired to do the role I was initially hired to do. 

The problem is that this new person is, to put it bluntly, an idiot. She is extremely slow and is not getting all the work done that she needs to. As a result I am now also doing elements of her job. Our contracts forbid discussion of salary (despite what Australian law has to say on the subject) but I am quite sure she's getting paid the same as me. This amounts, more or less, to the work of at least 2.5 people that I am now doing.

I have been with my company for 6 years now (I am 35). It's a large insurance company headquartered in the midwest but it has a large satellite office in Arizona with several thousand employees. 

Over the last 9 months, the work has gone from so-so/mundane to overwhelming. The company has reduced our office from 8 employees down to 4. The workload is exhausting. Two employees were RIF'd with a severance and 2 quit, including my boss. None of these positions were refilled.

Mentally, I cannot shut my brain off. I think about work, issues, things I need to do all the time. This has affected my sleep as well. Physically, I work out, but I have regular (stress?) headaches that are frustrating. Psychologically, I do not see a light at the end of the tunnel.

I'm thinking about approaching my company advising them that I intend to use FMLA. However, I'm concerned how that would look  (it would put the office in a hard position for sure). The most optimal situation would be for us to part ways with a severance. Those in HR, have you seen this done before? Is FMLA even an option based on what I've listed above?

Need Guidance with a Manager & HR,AskHR,3,cvuuh7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/cvuuh7/need_guidance_with_a_manager_hr/,2,1566885576.0,"Thank you to everyone in advance for reading this.  *I am new to Reddit and admittedly very nervous*, but I need the help where I can get it.  I'm a senior program manager within my company, I've been here about 22 months.  I have 9 employees and 14 projects amounting to about $60M in savings and benefits to the company that all roll up into my program initiative.  I'm a younger (35) female but not inexperienced, having been a round a block a few times and am a Navy veteran - So I can play with the boys and put up with their toys.

Recently a high profile project within the program waaaaaay went off the rails.  An employee was very seriously injured, senior management and regulatory bodies in our industry and the government also had to directly or tangentially get involved or be read in on the situation.  

The root cause analysis, which was conducted outside of my group, identified only 2 core issues (usually its dozens).  Through this process and subsequent documentation **absolved my direct and indirect teams, Me, and the processes which we managed.**  Bad Data **In** resulted in a Bad Result **Out**.  

It was very sad it happened and it shook me for sure, but that's what happens when you're in a garbage in / garbage out scenario.

Well....Over the last 9 weeks, my up-line manager, *who did take some heat for the situation*, has had a few ""1:1's"" with me, which were mostly normal and scheduled.  It is during these meetings however, that they've expressed to me how career limiting this event has become for several people including myself.  He been very quick to point out that they're only giving me ""friendly"" guidance, but based on my other personal interactions with senior leadership and co-workers; I actually do believe there's a legitimate perception issue about me and my team now.  I have a fair bit of emotional intelligence and can pick up on this quickly.

With that said, I've since cross-checked my ""standing"" with some of my program's key stakeholders and my internal customer, who happens to be a pretty senior leader but takes the time to be a coach to me.  Their perception is that I am fine, but it might take some time to heal wounds.  All good stability wise, a promotion might be delayed.  Which...to some degree I get.

**The summary of my issue is:**  Had my manager communicated this concern to me once, or even twice, I get it.  But we're now into our 6th 1:1 and it keeps coming up.  He basically has painted the picture of:

 \- There's people the company \*wants\* to keep and promote

 \- There's people that the company \*wants\* to move out

And I've moved from the top rung to this place where (in my own words)  ""they don't mind that I'm here...but I'm not going anywhere.""  Which, in many ways is  the worst place to be.  I am now to the point now where I am really sick and tired of hearing this from him every time we meet.  Its almost where my manager feels the need to interject this topic in some form or fashion in every meeting and conversation.  Sometimes tacitly, sometimes in these vague references.

**My Ask of My New Reddit Friends:**  

1. I am to the point **where I want my manager to do his f-ing job**
2. If I am considered to be such a liability to him and our team, despite what my internal customers are saying, **I feel like he should go to HR and work up an exit strategy** for me
3. Is this the wrong mindset or approach?  Can someone reset my thinking if it is?  I'm just at this place where I feel like if he thinks things are \*that\* bad, then we should do something about it.

**To quickly give you an FAQ:**

Did this situation result in any form of personal HR encounter or any form of written documentation?  **No,** I did not personally meet with HR over this issue

Did this situation result in any form of HR involvement?  **Yes**, of course, we damn near killed someone, but more on the regulatory side of things.  **To my knowledge, no one was punished over this.**

How visible was the issue?  **CEO & Exec Team on down**; company wide ""grape vine"" knowledge, very visible project; we're a pretty big company

Am I being proactive about my employment situation in other ways? **Yes**, I've started looking outside.  

Can I leave the role before I find something else?  **Yes** financially, but  I have qualms about this personally.

Am I stressed? **No**, I'm not stressed, because I am very good at what I do and am in pretty high demand.  I'm sad, This is only my second employer since college and I pride myself on longevity and learning.  

Thanks & Much Love,

I am located in Virginia and work in an industry that is not known for its welcoming nature. I am looking for tips on if I am working in a hostile environment and how I should proceed. 

I believe my direct boss has fostered a hostile work environment. He once made a comment to another coworker that he should ask me how to complete a task because my coworker was incapable. He did this loud and proud in front of about 15 people in our office. 

Later he asked me why I was stressed out, ‚Äúbecause you f***** up your project?‚Äù he asked. We both knew it was out of my control, and he later told me he said that because he wanted to see how I would react. 

He told the entire office I was on medication, which I am. One coworker decided to make fun of me, I quickly put a stop to that but it comes up occasionally. My boss has said, ‚Äúoh yeah we can‚Äôt make fun of you for that anymore.‚Äù

He calls me ‚Äúpledge‚Äù and got others to do the same. 

He talks about everyone behind their backs. After only one week working with him I heard what he had to say about everyone. He has even told clients about my coworkers and our bosses.

"Dilemma Related To Great Work Experience, Poor Undergraduate Performance",AskHR,3,cvvpd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/cvvpd1/dilemma_related_to_great_work_experience_poor/,9,1566889612.0,"I am including some backstory so you have all the details but I suppose that it's possible to skip to the TL;DR below.

I studied at a top university. I did quite well my first year and a half, but I made a rash decision to quit my former major in favor of something with more stable job opportunities (and completely unrelated to my former major) that I thought I liked. Within a few weeks of switching to engineering, I decided to apply for a few internships over winter break, and I secured an offer by January-end from a great firm due to my high GPA at that time. Later that spring, however, I struggled with some serious mental health issues and even had to miss a fair bit of college to recover from a suicide attempt. 

I bombed a lot of my classes because of it all, but I recovered in time to still take part in my internship that summer. I earnestly followed treatment options, started feeling better, and performed incredibly well at my job. I enjoyed the type of work, and I thought that the high-demand work culture worked very well for me. The company was so impressed that I was given a return offer for the next summer, which I gladly accepted. 

I knew I would be placed on academic probation for my multiple failed classes, so once the school year resumed, I took steps to mentally stay afloat; however, I slowly started realizing that my interests in the field were extremely underrepresented in my school's department. I really cared for a certain division of work within my field, but the majority of the classes for that major at my school primarily focused on very high-level math and physics. I did pretty well my first semester of my third year, but, come second semester, I started being unable to handle spending all of my time and energy on upper-level math and physics throughout the spring. I know that I am capable of performing well at a wide number of things, but I was just unable to both keep myself mentally healthy and manage 18 hours of course load that I did not care for. I ultimately just pushed too hard and ended up half-assing both things. 

It was also slightly worse in the spring because, at the time, I felt like I had to concentrate all of the upper-level requirements into a smaller number of semesters because I had switched into engineering very late and stupidly still wanted to graduate on time. There are a lot of parts of this story that I wish I could do over: changing the major in the first place, not realizing that I needed help earlier my sophomore year, and being so na√Øve about how long I should stay in college. 

Even though I slipped academically during my third year, I never slipped as much as I had my second year. I never failed another class, and my grades did slightly improve each semester. I also made sure to use my second summer at the company to show them that I am capable of good work by being a motivated team member and detail-oriented in every task. I made sure that those attributes were reflected in the quality of my work. I worked hard, and, by the end of my time with the firm, I seemed less like an intern and more like a full-fledged employee. This time, I was given a return offer for a full-time position. They even happily accommodated for a delayed start date so I could partake in a passion project after my graduation. I gladly signed the offer. 

My marks did get reasonably better for my fourth year. I excelled at senior design and left good impressions on most of my professors, but I still struggled to get higher than a C for the few remaining upper-level physics and mathematics courses. Even with the improvements, I ended up barely scraping by with just a 2.5 GPA. The huge drop that my GPA took from my second year proved to be much harder to recover from. 

**TL;DR:** At this point, it's important to note that the company is located in North Carolina, which has at-will employment. Even though I have signed an offer for employment with the firm, I understand that they have the ability to terminate that for whatever reason (except for race, etc.). I felt confident in my future with the firm, but I always had this fear in the back of my head that they would want to know my final GPA before I joined. Now, two weeks before my start date, the recruiter for the firm wants me to fill out a ""reapplication"" form of sorts. The form has an education section on it with a spot for GPA. 

Am I completely boned here? What are my options? As I mentioned before, I sincerely don't think that my GPA is representative of my actual work ethic, which I have demonstrated through my multiple internships to be great when it comes to the work that the company does. However, I'm still extremely worried that providing my GPA on a form like this might draw attention to my poor marks, and my panic-stricken brain is expecting the worst. I have admittedly even considered leaving the spot blank or filling in the form with something unrelated in the GPA section as if by accident. 

I've always been a very truthful person, and I am more than a little shocked that I have even considered these options, but I am truly at a loss... I figured I could reach out to the Reddit community to get some good advice and/or tough love. 

Also, if I include my GPA on the form, how should I approach answering any questions from the firm about the GPA? I have gotten a wide variety of answers from my friends, and I am too anxious to feel like I will think clearly about this."
Instructed not to Speak with my CEO,AskHR,28,cvm60s,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/cvm60s/instructed_not_to_speak_with_my_ceo/,6,1566843769.0,"Australia

I recently found out that over a few months ago a coworker of mine was instructed not to talk to the CEO anymore.

For some background, the CEO has an open door policy, likes to talk to his staff about work and also about golf, football and an array of other things. He is a very hands-on CEO.

In previous times of trouble, our CEO has told this employee that he doesn't want to ever be blocked from talking to his staff as it has happened in the past and has created huge problems. Also, that the reporting line from my coworker to the manager is ""informal"" and that my coworker (is a manager as well) is just to go about her job as usual.

My coworker has been ordered not to talk to the CEO, but to go to her manager who will talk to the CEO for her as he reports to the CEO and she does not.

This was part of a conversation he has said was a ""catch up"" but has changed reporting lines, her one staff member no longer report to her, but reports directly to him, she is no longer allowed to work from home (organisational policy says she can), she will be at work between 9:00am - 5:00pm which she already is but he accuses her of otherwise, as well as undermining him by going to the CEO (which I believe is not true) and not talking to him. He asked her if she wanted a support person (*which even she admitted that her brain should have seen that red flag but did not*) then proceeded to tell her she would have to report to him at the end of each week which sounds like disciplinary action in the form of a ""catch-up"" and has not provided her with written document of the things she needs to improve on.

My questions is, can he actually order her not to talk to someone at work and if she fails to comply, can this result in her rightly (*legally*) loosing her job?

&#x200B;

Edit: I don't need people to tell me to but out. That's not helpful. I'm not getting involved in terms of speaking for her or advocating. I'm trying to understand the legal and ethical rights she has in this situation and how it could be handled. I'm not putting up my hand to loose my job, I'm going to leave once I have another anyway, the place is toxic af. But if I can provide her some honest and helpful advice to show support, I would like to do that."

Is this behavior discrimination or just mean - sorry so long....,AskHR,0,cvyc4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/cvyc4r/is_this_behavior_discrimination_or_just_mean/,2,1566902869.0,"I worked for a global work at home company providing technical support for a major manufacturer of computers and mobile devices. I started working there in early 2017 with a disability accommodation of reduced hours. During the first two years based on business needs I changed team leaders 3 times. Any missed work time which was related to my accommodation was excused. Also, areas for performance improvement based KPI were left to the team leader as to how to motivate or coach the employee to improve. Different team leaders focused more on KPI‚Äôs than others. For example if one of the indicator measurements for meeting expectations was a 6.0 and the employee scored 5.5, there were options available to the team leader, from a written plan for improvement to a final written warning. During the first two years I scored below meets expectations and never received a verbal or written warning with possibly of termination if not improved. There was also no limit or specific amount of final written warnings that would mean absolute termination.  So to recap, I had doesn‚Äôt meet expectations and missed time and received no verbal or written warnings for anything. In early 2019 I transferred to a senior level team. With each previous transition to other teams there was required additional training prior to moving to the other team. If I needed to miss any time due to pain, I would email the trainer and team leader the reason I needed to miss time and include a copy of my accommodation, always passed all tests and never had a problem or disciplinary action taken because of this. The first day out of training working for the new team leader I received a final written warning for attendance. I had left 3 times 5 - 10 minutes early because of pain. Training classes were 8 hour shifts as opposed to my standard 5 hour shifts. Also the training lasted for 3 weeks so by the end of training I was feeling kinda rough. As you can imagine I was upset, I had never been written up. I‚Äôm kinda sensitive I guess, it just bothers me to be written up when I think I don‚Äôt deserve it. I may have overreacted, but I told the team leader I was going to discuss with HR because I didn‚Äôt think it was right to discipline me for missing a few minutes especially since I had an accommodation. The team leader told me that if I disagreed or had a problem I would have to deal with her. Follow the chain of command and if I went over her head, she would feel some kinda way that I wouldn‚Äôt like. Also she had been the #1 team leader for years and got what she wanted. Further more she had looked at my previous record and that other leaders had labeled me as a troublemaker.  Wow, I was stunned, disappointed and didn‚Äôt know what to say. I just tucked my tail between my legs and went back to work. This was now feeling like a hostile environment. I felt bad every day from that day forward. The first months review time I scored 5.97 which got me a final written warning. Few weeks later we had a new time keeping system, I came in 15 minutes early to ensure my login credentials worked and I didn‚Äôt get in trouble for being late. My password didn‚Äôt work so I called her about the problem with my login. She said not to worry, we would deal with it after start of shift. I need to say as a security regulation we are not supposed to log in early. So... after shift starts she immediately came up on my screen said I had broken a serious security rule ( by 5 minutes) and this would mean another final written warning and wasn‚Äôt sure she could save my job - I was so beat down by this person I couldn‚Äôt stand the negative actions any longer. I wrote an email stating for my sanity I couldn‚Äôt work for this person any longer and resigned. I emailed HR and explained what I have written here. A week later HR replied to my complaint that it would be investigated, but the results would not be provided to me. I was offered another entry level position for a different line of business, not technical or IT related.  My area of expertise and what I enjoy. Is there anything I can do to get my job back and ensure that this team leader is prevented from being allowed to do this to anyone else. Since the job is Work from Home, we are somewhat isolated which prevents discussion with any other team members to see if her behavior has impacted anyone else. In open team meetings there were constant threats to everyone about reaching the first place team slot or there were others ready to step into our chairs. It was a high stress environment. Sorry so long, but I really feel I have been treated unfairly and wanted to make what happened as clear as possible-  Thanks to anyone who read my story and any feedback"

But when you have been hired for the job already, and you are treated differently because of the piercings, is that discrimination?

I ask because my partner has been discriminated due to their appearance (piercings, coloured hair, tattoos). But they were given the job. They keep her because she is the best at the job, but that doesn't mean she deserves to be harassed for her appearance. Its a cash in hand job, so its not a set contract of pay, but she has sometimes been given less, which I am led to believe is due to the discrimination against her.

I have been the Director of Development (think guy-in-charge-of-fundraising) for a non-profit organization for 20 months. If you want a sad stat about the role, the industry average of the position is 18 months. I am exhausted from this job, but my wife has four months left until she finishes her masters and we move out of state for her to start her career. That's too little time for me to find something new without it seeming odd when I apply for another job in 4-5 months. To complicate matters, the only person I report to is my Executive Director. Unfortunately, my ED has terminal cancer. Most likely, the Associate ED will take over when the terrible inevitable happens. The Associate ED has stated to a confidant that she plans on firing everyone who isn't making goals as soon as she comes into the ED role. Fundraising can be heard and I've tried everything I can think of to make goal, but I have not and can say with a fair amount of certainty that she will fire me when the time comes. I work really hard and want to leave my organization in a good place, with a good plan, even if I was personally unable to execute it effectively enough. I really don't want to have to explain that I was fired from my last job in a job interview.

I am wondering - if I were to submit a letter of resignation on September 2nd that lists my final day as December 13, would I realistically be providing myself any protection from being fired (as doing so would make it seem like she just did it to keep the organization from having to pay out my PTO), or would it make it worse by allowing her to make the argument that I was ""checked out"" or something?

Verifying identity,AskHR,3,cv8vka,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/cv8vka/verifying_identity/,9,1566770643.0,"Hi,

I got ""accepted"" to work in the temporary staffing program at my alma mater, a college in Washington, D.C. The hiring offer is subject to sucessful completion of a background check. First Advantage conducted the background check company on behalf of my prospective employer. The background company raised a few orange flags with the results of the background check.

I sense that the most concerning for the college is that First Advantage could not associate my Social Security number with my name by conducting a credit check. Experian reported no credit report about me. I'm not surprised by this finding as I have never owned a credit card, nor borrowed money from a financial institution. The college's HR emailed what I take it is a Pre Adverse Action notice. The author of the email - the college's employee relations investigator  wrote that First Advantage could not verify my Social Security number and my name and that I have three days to dispute the background check results. I wrote back saying that I would initiate the dispute process wirh First Advantage. Three years ago, I had a court order changing my name - I am a transwoman. Prior to getting the employee relations investigator's email, I emailed the temporary staffing program coordinator to  explain the discrepancies that First Advantage  flagged. In hindsight, I incorrectly  wrote in my email that my name change order might have my Social Security number. After I received the email from the employee relations investigator, I wrote them back that I have no history of credit. I suspect it's my lack of credit history and not my legal name change that is the cause of First Advantage not being able to verify my identity. I asked if the college HR uses any of the SSN verification services online provided by Social Security for companies to confirm employee identities. The employee relations investigator did not answer my question. Also, I included in my email a PDF of benefits letter to me fom Social Security with a claim number, which is the same as my Social Security number. I fnd surprising that the employee relations investigator wrote me back that my email was helpful and asked me if I have a copy of my Social Security card.

I have since visited Social Security and requested a replacement card. It will take approximately two weeks for the card to arrive in the mail. The same day I went to Social Security I found my old Social Security card under my former name. I sent the emplpyee relations investigator a photo of this card. I'm eagerly waiting to hear back from him about next steps.

What do you think is the college's HR rationale, particularly that of the employee relations investigator regarding my hiring situation?

Do you recommend I take any other steps?

I applied for a competitive position with a large company about a month ago, through their careers page.

I‚Äôve also figured out the  email structure for the company so in theory I‚Äôve got their email address too. 

I‚Äôd like to follow up in case their software didn‚Äôt push through my application. I never got a confirmation email on the submission. It‚Äôs a senior level role and I have also designed an interactive digital portfolio of my work since applying; I thought this might be a good addition to a quick follow up note. (I know, I should‚Äôve had it already...  a different company asked for one, which indicated to me I should have one, so that‚Äôs just the way it happened)

Anyway, thoughts on if I should I follow up on LinkedIn or take a chance on the email (which I can only be 80% sure is right)?? Is both too much if I say something like ‚ÄúI just wanted to connect with you where it‚Äôs easiest for you‚Äù or something like that? Would love some opinions here :)"

I have an employee who is concerned about sharing personal information with other team members/management and accusing the company of acting unethically.

A manager that I support has several team members who are part of our Wellness Committee.  One of the things they have started is a ""wellness bingo challenge"" where employees can complete different activities (take the stairs instead of elevator, walk around the building, attend a fitness class, etc.).  Once you complete bingo, you turn in the card and get a small prize like a gift card or meal voucher at the company cafe.  She feels that the company should not collect this ""data.""

This employee has also commented that asking employees to share personal information with the team (hobbies, likes/dislikes, family, etc.) constitutes the company ""collecting personal data"" and wants reassurance that this data is being protected (sometimes an employee will populate a slide and share it with the team, so it is being transmitted).

She has commented that the company should not ask for this information, and that it is unethical to do so.  I have told her that these activities are purely voluntary, but she persists that they make her uncomfortable.

Frankly, I think this employee is being a bit paranoid, but I want to address their concerns and still let the team participate in the activities if they wish.

Has anyone had an employee who is extremely protective of their personal life?  Any advice on how to address this?

Long story short, the manager went on maternity leave so the owner kept giving me all of her responsibilities (interviewing/training, firing, buying supplies, etc) while still paying me barely above minimum wage. The final straw was him telling two ladies he was close with, both of which were not qualified at all, to come in for training with me without even giving me any heads up. But that's another story.

According to this Nevada state law I read about [here](https://piccololawoffices.com/long-nevada-employer-pay-get-fired-quit-nevada-las-vegas/), he owes me my final paycheck within 7 days from when I quit (since that would come sooner than scheduled payday). In the final text message I sent him I made sure to tell him that ""I expect my final paycheck within 7 days, as per Nevada state law"" but knowing how he is I doubt that he will have it for me by tomorrow, the 7 day mark. Thinking about it now, he actually said something about going on a trip where he won't be back until like the 27th.

Anyways, I read that if he doesn't get me that paycheck within 7 days then he owes me wages and compensation for each day afterwards. I was wondering if anyone here knows exactly how that penalty works and/or how it's calculated. Also what is the appropriate course of action to remind him that I need this paycheck? Like should I just text him and tell him about how he owes me penalties or do I call into the store and ask about it?

My first full year with the company, a new leave policy was implemented.  We have two forms of leave that we earn as we work.  This was some years ago now.

First is classed as emergency leave, and can be used for anything, be it sick, or a planned day off in advance.

Second category is considered extended leave.  It can only be used on absences of 3 days or more, with a medical professional's note.  (There may be other clauses, but I know several years ago I wasn't able to use it to organize things after my last living parent, that I lived with, passed away suddenly.)

Both are earned at a rate of 0.92 hours per 40 hours worked, none is earned for any time past the first 40 hours worked each week.  The first leave is capped at 5 days earned, any extra earned after the cap is dumped into the second.

I've currently got over a 200 hours in the second category.  It will not pay out if I leave the company.

Right now it's feeling like a hollow benefit.  And I'm going on year three since my last increase in pay. (Other signs are also saying jump ship as our location keeps getting awards, but staff are not being replaced as they leave, more duties are being pushed onto remaining staff.  We've gone from a staff of 6 to 8, to a staff of 3 and a part timer.)

 Are then any laws or rules I can use to force a pay out if I leave the company?  (I mean, other than finding new job, and in the time before starting it and leaving, finding some medical or mental health reason to be out for a month?)"

So I've recently been offered a job and I just began the background checks and onboarding process. This position is for a tech related field and I had an internship that gave me experience for this but the other two past employments were completely unrelated to this position. 

When filling out the information for the employment background check on the website, I used my resume to double check dates and what not to be sure everything was accurate. However, I noticed that my Pizza place experience had the wrong year on it so I changed it to the correct year. So same duration just changed it from 2016 to 2017. I notified the employer in an email of this adjustment when entering the information into the site so it would be accurate for the check.

I also didn't include my other irrelevant experience at a water company since I was in middle school and it wouldn't shot up as an official employment. I wasn't officially employed, just helped out sometimes when I was young. The employer surely knows this since the year was written on my resume and was quite awhile ago. But I still informed them of this exclusion within the same email.

I did include my IT experience of course and it was 100% accurate and since they probably care most about that, I assume they don't care too much about the others but I wanted to inform them of the minor correction regardless.

So I corrected a year and removed an experience I had when I was too young to avoid complications in the system checking for the water experience. I know I may be paranoid but I really want my first job out of college and don't want to mess it up.

Am I okay or should I sorry about these two minor changes? Any advice?"

Some questions would be why does a school system/company continue to deal with someone that creates openly toxic work enviroments to point every employee assigned quits? Are the other actions legal and what are some ways to handle? Finally, any words of advice appreciated.

"[UK] Employer Forcing ""Social Login""?",AskHR,2,cugy3l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/cugy3l/uk_employer_forcing_social_login/,4,1566609718.0,"My employer is currently moving the online stuff for employees (training, schedule, bank details, etc.) to a new online system.

The available list is Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon and Instagram.

ANYWAY, can they force me/us to do this? They aren't allowing the more traditional registration of just entering my email address and a password to create an account - you \*have\* to link one of the above accounts to register for it and then use it for logging in going forward.

I know I sound paranoid, but I've never used these annoying social logins anywhere else online up until now, and I certainly don't want to start doing it now... I know I could just do my Google one or whatever as it's not ""social media"", but I just don't want to link anything. 

The training video for managers says if there are Staff without any of the above accounts, they have to create one. I also don't feel I should have to create a new random account just for this, as that also bugs me.

Maybe I'm just being awkward. And paranoid. But my question is, are they allowed to force this?

This has been the ONLY time this company has requested any sort of phone interview with me in a year of applying for job openings within my field. The guy later suggested I apply for the full-time position, when I did I never heard anything back from him or the company. Now I applied for Customer Rep position back in April and once again did not hear anything back. Two days ago I decided to try out changing my name on my resume and instead used my coworker's name (who has a white-sounding first name and Spanish the last name, I have a very ethnic-sounding first name but a Spanish last name). My coworker got an email the next day at 7 am, I submitted the same resume but with my name later that day and was expecting a response considering IT IS THE SAME resume but NOTHING.

The conditions to accept the position was to move from my hometown of New York. I gladly agreed thinking this would be a new start for me and learn more as a person both professional and on a personal basis.

Long story short, after 3 months into the new position; I was tasked to provide inside sales support/customer service (previous role) to the Chicago office. Not once during those three months was I ever asked to shadow the other field sales rep or sales manager (current manager/supposed sales coach). During that time as inside sales support, I would preform the tasks at hand and would get lambasted via email for it by the sales manager with no prior instruction on how to preform said task.

Eventually the Chicago office was promoting a new product/service and the sales manager had assigned me a cold calling task to promote the new service. I preformed the task and gave her a report of the customer feedback, she then wrote me a condescending email asking why did I preform the task wrong and why did I not schedule a field sales call? So I scheduled the calls and when the weekly sales meeting came up, she asked how the sales calls went and I said ""well you know its the company way to sink or swim, so I'm swimmin' "" 

Fast-forward to today, I am now out and about as a field sales rep in the assigned territory. Pretty much learning on my own and receiving coaching from my old manager in New York no less.  My old manager had a project in my  territory which was a great opportunity for me and the company, my current manager had informed me that the project was ""not coordinated correctly and the rate offered for the service was too low"". As you can see, every single thing has to be approved by my current manager. How can be an effective field sales rep if I am to be micromanaged? I am lucky I dont have ask permission from this manager to sneeze or fart.

My old manager in New York has known about the micromanaging along with the condescending emails, I told him that this is not working out for me here in Chicago and he has informed me that one of his current field sales reps may not be returning to the company due to health issues. I am more than willing to ride out the last 6 months of the year, but what would be the best way to talk to my senior manager or HR about asking for a transfer in the new year? If I do divulge that I am being bullied/mistreated, it will lead to be a big HR blow up. My senior manager does not like when people transfer and subsequently transfer back to their hometown.

on 06-21-19 I contacted my direct supervisors, I went up my chain of command and was told I would have to talk to HR. So I spoke with HR. in both Colorado and in Texas via email and  HR of COLORADO finally acknowledges that it was their mistake and they would correct it immediately. 

July of 2019 passes and i'm still regularly contacting hr as the money had still not been returned and during this time I was short on my bills and my rent was late. I was told it would be fixed that day and they would contact me back. August 2019, I am still going round and round with HR and in Texas, No one will take responsibility and no one will give me my money back, I call corporate HR the very next day. 

I was told it would be on this weeks paycheck, meaning 8/22's paycheck, which it was. But on TOP of that paycheck I received from the company a letter that asked me to sign, stating that the amount of money was directly deposited into my account on 8/22 but in turn, I acknowledge and AGREE to repay the amount of money back to my company.

Skills vs Credential Gap in Hiring? (General U.S. Auestion),AskHR,5,cu467u,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/cu467u/skills_vs_credential_gap_in_hiring_general_us/,1,1566539010.0,"Edit: Oops, misspelled the title. Dx Oh well.

In some industries, potential employees can more easily signal their skills through credentials. The IT industry seems to be an example of this because you (HR) can know the specific set of skills an applicant has from their IT certifications.

However, not all industries have the luxury of having credentials for each and every specific skill. Arguably, some skills can't be measured for a credential.

Generally speaking, when there is information asymmetry between an applicant's skill vs credentials, how do you close that gap and determine whether an applicant is a liability vs a hidden gem? What can applicants do to prove their skills if there are no credentials for those skills? Again, this is a general question, but industry-specific examples are welcome."

So this just happened so I'm pretty shaken up over it. I am currently job hunting for mechanical engineering jobs. I found a role with a leading company I thought was perfect and I felt I ticked all the boxes in the quals/experience specified. I submitted my cv and made it to the first interview stage which was an online interview where I had to submit video responses to questions

Problem 1: despite doing 6 practice questions fine when went in for real the app crashed and closed on question one. When I went back in apparently I missed my chance and it went to questions 2

Problem 2 (and this one really gets me): the first 2 questions are technical questions but are not related to the job description. No where in the description does it mention experience or understanding of this system is needed. In fact in another job description it specifies that a knowledge of this would be desirable so it's not even assumed for all roles. 

This completely threw me and I basically had to answer ""I dont know"". The next 2 questions were compentancy based but I'm worried I blew it in those because I was just so blindsided by the technical questions 

I didn't get asked any technical questions relating to the job specification. Is this normal or did they make a mistake? What can I do or should I accept that I have blown it?"

I say basically because they were not hired in the engineering department, but rather INSIDE sales (we share the office) because he had a strong effluence on who was hired.  This act alone didn‚Äôt even register with me. Although highly unqualified for their positions, I was actually excited about having two jokesters around the office to lighten the mood a little. That was until the annual sales meeting. This is more of a vacation for OUTSIDE sales employees to see the other salesmen and have a little fun. It‚Äôs a big deal to go to one of these getaways at my company. In fact, no one from INSIDE sales or engineering has ever been. Some of these employees have been here for 20+ years. 

That was, of course, until my manager got his family hired.  They were not employees for two weeks before they were invited to the sales meeting. This was the first of many red flags. 

Fast forward almost 2 years and I‚Äôve reached the last straw. The son left the company, but the nephew remains and is more favored than ever. 

A design project I‚Äôve been working on for over a year is nearing completion pending a successful build and test. I arrive at work this morning (20 min early as always) and someone informs me that my manager and his nephew are on a business trip together to witness the test on MY PROJECT. Why a sales employee is even involved at this level of the design process is beside the point, but why am I not allowed to finish my project? And the thing is, my manager didn‚Äôt even tell me they were doing it today. He told me weeks ago that he‚Äôs working on scheduling the build and he‚Äôd let me know. But I know the reason the nephew is there, not for engineering expertise since he‚Äôs not an engineer or even an engineering employee, he‚Äôs there because the CEO of the corporation will be witnessing (we are one of 32 companies worldwide). My manager took him to network and advance his nephews‚Äô career by meeting and knowing some higher ups.

I don‚Äôt know if I can work FOR HIM anymore. I love the company, the people, the work. I feel like I have a very defined career path here, as told by the GM. I‚Äôve had exceptional evaluations every year (while in engineering school remember) and was promoted to Product Engineer (highest engineer besides the engineering manager) two years before I graduated. But I can‚Äôt work FOR HIM. 

There are many, many more examples of what I feel is unfair treatment that the entire office space (sales and engineering) has obviously noticed. I have never filed a complaint because I keep telling myself it‚Äôs petty and I sound jealous, but I can‚Äôt keep quiet any longer. 

This is where I seek your opinion and knowledge. What should I do and how should I handle it? I want to tell my manager, but I believe it will only get worse (putting more of his nephews work duties on me). I want to tell HR, but I don‚Äôt want to be seen as a problem employee. I want to tell the GM who I feel will be very understanding and receptive (because he‚Äôs not blind to it all). I don‚Äôt know who to tell, I just want it to stop. It makes it really hard to work for him, but I feel I cant leave since my company paid for my degree (not bound contractually, but loyally). What should I do?"

https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/cubusk/update_my_boss_is_asking_for_ridiculous_references/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share <--- **most recent update**



I've only ever worked corporate but I've recently moved to a tiny law firm of 4 employees including my boss. I've been there for 3 weeks, 4 weeks on Monday 26th Aug.


I was on holiday two weeks prior to starting my job but I made a conscious effort to send her over my references and my new starter letter which had all my basic info on.

Bear in mind I DEFINITELY did this.


Cut to midway through my holiday and she has called me advising she still needs my starter letter and references. I advised I sent them all in the same envelope. She advised she has the starter letter but not the references which makes NO sense. I digress. Anyway I tell her I will give them to her upon my return from my holiday and she told me to give them on my first day of the job which was the first working day after my return, so I did and heard nothing more.


Today she randomly called me while she wasn't in the office and accused me of being on my mobile during working hours. I assumed she has some kind of app that links to the security cameras but the angle the camera is at in my office in particular obscures the view of my desk. I moved my arm to show her I was leaning over writing in my notebook and my elbow was blocking her view. She didn't apologise for this but responded ""oh."" then started berating me for being on my phone on my lunch the day prior, which she has never raised an issue with before, and for having headphones on when on my lunch. Whatever, I said I'd go outside to use my phone despite she and my other colleagues using their phones at their desks throughout the day. 


She then, while on a roll I suppose, started mentioning my references and stating that she still hadn't heard back from anyone, which she had not mentioned prior to today. I told her I that is odd as I know one of my old HR reps and she assured me I could give out her details. She then backtracked and said she *has* heard back but the info was not up to her standards as it only states my start and end dates, what I did and what kind of worker I am. These are all corporate firms and the responses would have 100% been from a HR rep opposed to my actual managers. She THEN went on to say this is in the terms of my employment as per my contract but then I realised I HAVEN'T EVEN SIGNED MY CONTRACT YET. OR SEEN IT.


She has now told me she wants to have a conversation with every manager I have had for the past 3 years and she can't allow me to sign my contract without this info.


This will never happen.  I put it in my comment for r/legaladviceuk but I would be lucky if I was able to have a conversation with one of my old managers while I was an employee, let alone an ex-employees new boss. I really don't think my old manager will give her the time of day, and my manager before that has left the other firm.

I have a HR rep supposedly but I've not met her or heard from her. I supposedly have a one-to-one in the next few weeks but I dunno. I don't even know her name.

Difficult coworker causing issues for everyone,AskHR,9,ctotuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/ctotuc/difficult_coworker_causing_issues_for_everyone/,4,1566458241.0,"(US/TX) edit for location

Our company hired an employee. This employee started working at another site and transferred to where I currently work. He's aggressive, pushy, argumentative, combative, and almost impossible to train. He was talked to by management at the other site and has been spoken to here as well, more than once. He hasn't made many friends and no one wants to work with him. 

I have personally spoken with coworkers and management to try to find a way to deal with him since I'm his primary trainer. He's only been at this site for a few weeks, he was at the other for a few months. In reaching out, I learned that the same issues were present there and they basically gave up and stopped trying. The other site didn't have very nice things to say about him. 

It all came to a head yesterday, I called HR this morning, as previous conversations with my manager had not gotten any results. 

I just received an email from my manager asking to speak with me about what has transpired. It states that he has spoken with the lead from the other site and is concerned about my involvement. 

I feel like I'm about to get hit by the proverbial bus as my coworkers at the other site are all younger, males who hang out together after work hours. 

What, if anything, can I do at this point?"

I'm being specifically asked to apply for a new position that would be a jump of several pay grades - and it might involve my re-locating from out of state. With over ten years at this company, should I ask for something in the middle of the new pay range, or what?

**Full version:**

I've been with my current employer for over 12 years now. In the past several years, I have made several lateral transfers that involved WAY more responsibility and impact from my work, but did not see any tangible increases in my overall compensation.

A former leader of mine has reached out to me regarding a position that would bring me back into his organization, and would bring several big changes to my life: moving from hourly to salary, a jump several rungs up the pay scale chart, and a potential need to move to an area with a much higher cost of living than where I currently reside.

The potential new role has a VERY wide pay band - spanning from \~$60k at the low end to over $110k at the high end - and I'm really uncertain of what I should ask for here. The new role would bring yet more increases in my area of responsibility, but I also know that I'm going to have a ramp-up period on my end while I learn some new areas of the business that I'll be supporting.

Is it acceptable and/or standard practice to ask for a larger salary if the position does end up requiring a move in comparison to what I would ask for without the need to re-locate?

Any advice would be appreciated."

Background: He has been with his company for almost ten years. Moved up the ranks. Gets paid well. Last year had a elective surgery that caused several complications where he was in and out of the hospital for about 8 months with multiple other surgeries. Never missed anytime before that. Also, during the sick leave the company had reached out and even offered him a promotion. Which he turned down because he didn't know what was going on with his health at the time. Things are getting better, but he still has some minor issues here and there. 

The current role he is in is not easy to come by in the company. He most likely would have to step down into another role to be able to stay with the company. Which he has no problem with. 

His fear is that they won't accept his transfer after having issues this year. The company and boss have been great about the issues and fmla process. They can refuse a transfer if they want. He has seen the area he is in refuse transfers in the past. 

We're trying to figure out what to say to his company to transfer. We don't want them to lean on the health issues so we're trying to figure out what to say to make it a smooth and acceptable transition."

I work in a restaurant with about 20 other people and have ptsd, add-pi, autism, mdd, and another personality disorder for reference.

We were talking about setting up reasonable accommodations for me to help me out at work, and the examples he gave me were all things that would apply to physical disabilities like wheelchair access, etc. I asked for 2 accommodations for myself that my doctor recommended: weekly (or more often) meetings between my boss and I to discuss emotions and interpersonal relationships, because I'm really not the best at understanding people and sometimes I do or say things that might upset someone, and I like to know how I can prevent it and learn to not to do that. The 2nd one deals with what I would consider marginal tasks, cleaning to be exact. I have an absolute fear due to my ptsd that if I miss a single spec of anything when cleaning, I'll be fired. I also have the fear that if I stay at work too late at night cleaning, I'll be fired. This is because my area manager has threatened it already if I don't complete things 100% and mentioned that he's written people up for being at work too late. Due to my inability to break rules like that, it puts me in a corner and I get stressed out every night going through auditing everything several times, making sure there's nothing missing but it causes me to be there late due to that extreme fear. So I asked HR if it would be fine if I left some things at 95% instead of 100%, because that would alleviate that fear and allow me to just do the one walk through audit and not spend all night scrubbing everything over the fear that I'll be fired. 

Anyway, that's the back story behind why I asked for those two things. Would those two things be considered reasonable accommodations for me due to the circumstances surrounding them and my own mental illnesses and doctor recommendations, or would they be considered preferential treatment?

The project is costing approx. $35,000. We‚Äôve given him almost everything in installments, with only a couple of payments left as things hopefully wrap up. 

The contract said that the completion date would be July 12, but included a clause that there may be unforeseen circumstances that delay the project. These circumstances ended up being that our contractor sucks. Pretty badly. 

He‚Äôs almost *never* here. Some days, if he does show up, he‚Äôs only here for 1-2 hours. Progress has slowed to a *crawl*. 

We picked out the tile for the bathroom six months ago and he only ordered the subway tiles for the wall. He only went to order the floor tiles only two weeks ago, we found out that it is backordered 6+ weeks. We were furious and had to go with another tile because we just can‚Äôt put the bathroom on hold for that long. 

We came home the other day to see that he has almost finished the bathroom tile. Great! We thought... but it ended up that the tile trim on the walls is entirely mix-matched with different sized rims, if that makes sense. I don‚Äôt have a pic at the moment! When we brought it up, our contractor told us that he had to get the trim from two different stores (?) and that he would be able to use the grout to blend the differences together so we wouldn‚Äôt be able to notice. 

Huh? Why wouldn‚Äôt he just find a supplier that had enough of the same tile, instead of buying two different sizes? And why didn‚Äôt he ask us if it was ok first? We have since told him to take it down and replace it all with the same size trim. 

I‚Äôm starting to think that maybe he used leftover tile from another job to save money and also that he didn‚Äôt order all of our bathroom tile when he should have, because he took our money and used it for something else at the time. 

Can we ask him for detailed invoices and such to see where all of our money has been going and when? I‚Äôm probably being a bit too skeptical, but things are starting to smell fishy around here these days.

Yesterday evening I noticed it was still wet, and this morning I noticed an actual tiny puddle on top and this evening it has started washing away enough there are holes in the caulk going through.

Anyone have any idea whats going on here? There‚Äôs been no rain, though i do notice there is some water coming out of a gutter downspout around the corner... Is it just dew collecting overnight?

I have this giant 82"" by 58"" bathroom mirror with 3 ugly hanging lights. https://imgur.com/a/uoV90L2

I am seriously considering removing the mirror and replacing them with two 34"" x 30"" [Kohler Verdera](https://www.us.kohler.com/us/verdera-lighted-medicine-cabinet-34-x-30/productDetail/medicine-cabinets/1482521.htm?skuId=1481557&brandId=1313532) medicine cabinets. The reason for this is that I barely have any storage in the bathroom, 3 drawers and 2 cabinets that are mostly occupied with plumbing.

I would probably skim-coat the wall and paint it some kind of dark blue as well.

The wall the mirror is attached to is a non load-bearing interior wall, on the other side of the wall there is a master bedroom with a mini-split unit. The wall is framed with 2x4's. The ceiling is insulated since this is an exterior ceiling, so i'd rather not mess with ceiling wires.

I do not think I'd be able to recess the medicine cabinets since that'd leave the drywall on the other side ""hanging"" in the air due to removal of the ""middle"" stud, since the cabinets are 34"" wide.

My questions

a) Am I insane?  
b) Safest way to remove giant 200lbs mirror? Do I carefully smash it, or do I try to cut out the drywall?  
c) What kind of lights would you put there instead? They'd have to be ceiling mounted in the existing positions, and hanging lights obviously wont work with a medicine cabinet. I'm thinking some kind of spotlights?

Luckily, unlike the master bathroom (another story), this one looked to just be a one time thing with no major damage.

I'm in the process now of replacing the drywall and wanted a quick bit of insight on how best to go about placing the drywall.

[Pictures here](https://imgur.com/a/eWRSyFv)

First 2 pictures are unedited, second 2 pictures are to highlight what I am thinking.  

For the side along the edge next to the molding, I was thinking of cutting the rest of the drywall straight to the edge, screwing a furring strip butted up right to the edge, and then screwing the edge of the drywall into the furring strip and then along each joist going down.

For the side in the middle of the room, I was thinking of cutting the drywall there even with the middle of the joist and butting the other edge up the patch there, and then doing screws on each side of the drywall along the joist, approximately 6"" apart.  If that didn't work, my next thought was to cut a little bit past the joist and add another furring strip for the existing drywall to be secured into, with the new drywall being secured into the existing joist.

So, with all that stated, does that seem like a logical progress for hanging this drywall?

Second question is that it looks like there is decently thick layer over the existing drywall which I assume was a combination of tape and mud.  Should I attempt to trim that down along the edge of the existing drywall to where it has a smooth seam, or leave as is and tape/mud the butt joints over and build up then feather out to create a smooth transition?"

The issue is within the first two light switches. The left switches controls the light on the right side, and the right switch controls the light on the left. I want to swap these two switches, so they're in line with the lights they control. I thought this would be easy so I opened up the switch box thing, and was utterly confused, as it seems there's only three sets of wires.

Logically I feel I know the answer to this question, but I want to make sure to:

1. Reinforce what I feel the answer is
2. Keep my OCD at bay

So here it goes...

On Sunday, I started a project to redo all of the caulking on the shower/tub of my guest bathroom.  Unfortunately, this process took much longer than I expected, and I was unable to complete all of the work on Sunday, and I do not have much free time until this coming Sunday at the earliest.

My concern is this:  In my stripping of the silicone, there are now cracks exposing small amounts of the sub-floor around the tub, as well as areas of drywall along the walls of the shower/tub.  I am worried that, even though this bathroom is unused currently, the door is always open, and the one vent in the bathroom is open creating airflow from our HVAC, moisture might get in there and cause a problem.

Is this a cause for concern and I should attempt to finish the job ASAP?  Or since the tub/shower are unused, I shouldn't have an issue with the duration of uncaulked tub?

Thanks in advance!"

Is this a bad idea? Ripping the middle out of laminate and gluing the tongue back on,HomeImprovement,7,di966z,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/di966z/is_this_a_bad_idea_ripping_the_middle_out_of/,15,1571180678.0,"TL:DR - Is it okay to rip out a section in the middle of a laminate plank and glue the tongue section back on to reduce board width?

Hello, new homeowner struggling on what the best way is to proceed with laying down laminate flooring..

So, im starting to install pergo in two adjoining rooms.  There is a \~5 foot entry between the rooms and would *prefer* to have the laminate be continuous without a transition.  The adjoining rooms (living/dining) have a combined width of \~23' through the entry (so, based on my understanding a transition should not be necessary).

The issue i am hitting is that the planks are wider than the entry between the rooms (planks run parallel to the entry in the dining room).  So when i go from the last row in the living room to the entry, when i put the first row down in the dining room, the plank from the entry way will be overlapping into that room.  My thought was to reduce the width of the board in the entry by about an inch by cutting a section out of the plank and gluing the tongue back on, so that the first row in the dining room can line up.

Should i be concerned about the integrity of using wood glue for this or the resulting aesthetics?  The boards are a smidge over 6"" in width and \~7/16"" in thickness.

I do not have a router to re-create the tongue.  I was concerned on gluing the boards straight together as the groove between boards would not look correct.

Apologies if this is hard to follow, i may be over-thinking this.  Trying to measure 30 times and cut once..

Thanks for any thoughts/feedback!

Jeff

*This is all provided that I keep the last row in the living room full width instead of ripping it down 2"" around the entry to the dining room (so the first and last row in the living room would be equal width -- debating this since the first row will be out of sight for the most part ).  In this case i would have to cut the width of the board in the entry in half to account for the extra 2"".*"

 [https://imgur.com/gallery/gEITxM1](https://imgur.com/gallery/gEITxM1)

Anyway, here's a quick timeline and summary of the project:

First thing was to take down the doors. Not much to describe there. Then sand and sand. I used a palm sander to take care of most of the peeling clearcoat on the outside and then used sponge sanders to get into the nooks and crannies.

Once that was done, I identified a few cracks and dents that needed to be filled. I just used bondo (yep, automotive bondo - it's pretty much the same stuff as your two-part wood fillers, but quite a bit cheaper).

After cleaning and blowing off the doors, it was time for the fun part - the painting! For paint, I used an oil-based paint that's advertised for steel doors by rustoleum - purchased at Menards. These doors are fiberglass, but I think it will be okay. As far as oil-based paints, there was a surprisingly small selection. If I was going to do it again, I would get something from a store that specializes in paint for a better color and finish selection.

I mixed in 3-5% acetone to make it thin enough to spray through an automotive HVLP gun. This is where I could have done a better job initially. I sprayed the front first (fortunately), and I either didn't add quite enough acetone or didn't mix it enough, because it came out a bit thick in parts. Not *too* noticeable in the end though.

The can says to wait 24 hours between coats, but I didn't have that much time, so I only waited about 18. Then did a light sanding before spraying another coat. Gave this a full 24 hours before handling and reinstalling. The bottom part of the new door handle has a different screw location than the previous handle, so there is a hole where the old handle was (can be seen on the interior pic). I will be filling that with foam, covering in bondo, and touching up in the coming days."

The problem: the ignitors on the stove top will not work unless the oven is lit. 

Here's the story. When I bought the house the stove top worked (early this summer). I didn't bother checking the oven. I unplugged for 3 months while I completely renovated the house. When I plugged it back in, stove top would not ignite (gas okay, just no spark) and the oven would not ignite. I can live with manually lighting the stove top burners. I can't live without an oven.  So I did some research and ordered a new oven ignitor. In the meantime, I had cycled the breaker the range was on and magically (or nargles) the stovetop ignitors worked! The oven ignitor showed up, I swapped it in and the oven worked! But...the stovetop ignitors then didn't. Again gas flow is fine, just have the electric issue.
I have now discovered the stovetop ignitors do work only if the oven is on and lit. 

How do I banish these nargles? I can't afford a new unit right now."

It's time to do maintenance on it after we moved in. I took the side off and the inside is filthy: evaporator coil, blower, burners, plenum, all of it. Not sure if it is growing anything or if it is just dirt, but it smells when the covers are off. The little bit of insulation on the inside is or has been wet. The filter holder wasn't properly sealed or sheltered from rain (it is now) so the filter use to get wet and collapse. I've pulled handfuls of dirt/mud off the bottom pans. It's on blocks that have sunk so that the bottom of the unit is even with the ground. The theory is that rain water washed a decent amount of dirt into the bottom of the pan.

Ducts are in a crawl space. They arent great, but they are insulated (ie. not sure how leaky). Plenum is horizontal and goes through the wall.

I've got a quote for $900 to disassemble most of the unit and clean it. They couldn't get to cleaning the plenum. I would still need to get a shovel out and dig a trench around it so water would flow around it instead of through it (assuming that is the problem). 

I've also got a quote for $6500 to replace the entire unit, put on a new plenum, and put the new unit on a proper pad. It would be 14 seer. I'm pretty sure the current unit is over sized.

Plumber Issues -,HomeImprovement,2,dicxun,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dicxun/plumber_issues/,4,1571196324.0,"Eight weeks ago at 8pm on a Friday night before I'm about to leave for vacation I hear a waterfall in my basement.  That's right, a complete poo waterfall coming out of the toilet and downstairs shower.  My first of it's kind, I did a 5 minute search and google review of 24 hour plumbers in the area (MD) and chose one based on ratings.  

The call went to a central switchboard who gave me the rates of plumbers she would be routing me to ($89/hour).  I thought that price was ridiculously cheap and wasn't holding my breath. The next guy on the line said he could get someone out to me in two hours, for a $149 call out fee he had to take over the phone.  Sure.  Two hours pass, a technician calls and says it will be another two to four hours before he can get to us. Well great. Another two hours pass, he will give us an update, or he can come between 7am and 9am in the morning.  Sure, I choose that route, thinking I can possibly sleep and then maybe just miss one day of vacation.  8am the next morning I call him.  I'll be there in an hour he says.  When he shows up - yep, it's clogged (go figure), and it will be $1,200 to clean it out (snake up to 50 feet) through the clean out in the laundry room.  Holy Potato Chips.  Takes him 90 minutes, says he found a clog 30 feet out (almost to the street), no roots or discernible cause.  Side note, he used the hot water hookup from the washer, turned off my cold water to the washer, and for some reason moved my washer drain pipe to the floor so when I tried to bleach the poopy clean up materials and clothes it didn't work unless it was on hot water and drained all over the floor.  

As fun as that experience was, I didn't leave a bad review for the company, I figured the guy was tired from being on call all night and plumbing is freaking expensive. I still felt used and tricked, but I had limited options at that point. 

Fast forward eight weeks and the same things happens again (again on a Friday night). I am a veteran now and wait until Monday (that's right very slow flow meant I could flush once every six hours). No way I am paying those prices again.  I call a new company who is very nice, sends someone out within an hour, he cleans it out and gets a six inch ball of roots up.  His opinion - the previous guy just punched through and was done.  He said he always try to feel around and ensure the clog is out.  With the roots the size that they were, he was surprised the previous people didn't find anything.  He was 1/3 of the price, and would have only been 10% more for weekend/off hour work.  Doh. 

Now to the advice section.  I left company B (the good guys) a 5 star review.  Company A (over priced and late) I called to see what their warranty was, see if they had any thoughts on the duration, price, etc.  The guy on the phone basically said he had no idea why I would call.  If the clog is clear for 2-3 days, not their problem anymore. Their prices are their prices, etc.

Since I relied so heavily on reviews the first time around I really want to leave an honest low star review based on my experience, noting the job was done on the weekend, clog was cleared, but according to follow-up work, just the bare minimum was done, was way more expensive than I was quoted on the phone, and was about 10 hours later than initially quoted.  

What is your opinion? Once I rate I don't think I can take it back.  Is the first company correct, or is the second guy?"

In the process I realized my water heater (55 gallon tank) is about 13 years old so looking into replacing that as well before it gets to a point of failure. 

The HVAC company has suggested and given me a proposal for a tankless water heater system, a Navien NPE 240.

My home is one side of a duplex and we have one water line coming in feeding both sides of the duplex. For the most part water pressure is fine, not fantastic but no issues 90% of the time. If I am in the shower, and my neighbor turns on his washer and decides to do a load of dishes with their dishwasher, I get a drop in water pressure that is very noticeable. And if a toilet is flushed during this it slows to a trickle until one of the water appliances shuts off and then pressure builds back up. 

My question is will a situation like this cause problems with a tankless system?

I can deal with the same drops in water pressure, just not sure if it would get worse with a tankless system. 

Would I lose hot water completely until the water pressure built back up? Would the system freak out if water flow to it slowed? Or would it simply know to shutoff or reduce the heating portion so it doesn‚Äôt overheat until water flows through it normally again?"

If you stand and watch the largest bush you'll see several dozen flitting around it.  This bush is about 6' tall and ~8' in diameter, very dense, and butted against the front stoop and front door of my house.

I suspect the nest is either in this bush, or under it.  I've tried to watch to see where they are going, but I can't really tell.  During my investigation I did find a dead bird deep in the bush, damned ominous!

I'd wait for freezing temperatures, but we may have a month+ before we get there, and in the meantime it has felt like a life/death everyday going in the front door -- we have a 1yo which makes it even more nerve wracking.  We've also got birthday party for the baby next weekend and will have dozens of family members coming/going through that door.

The bushes are going to get ripped out, so preserving them isn't an issue.  I tried to cut the big one down with a 20' pruning saw but managed to get it stuck -_- ... I did that this morning just before the sun hit the bushes and I didn't see any wasps at the time, that effort seemed to agitate them because a few started coming at my so I took off and afterward there was a big up tick in their activity for the 15-20 minutes -- they were bashing furiously against the living room windows.

I can't just crawl in there to cut with a handsaw because I think I'd get the wasps angry, even at night or on a cold morning I worry they'd rally and come after me.  I have permethrin concentrate that I've used for ticks around the perimeter of the yard w/ a garden sprayer -- is that appropriate to mix up and spray all over the shrubs to try to kill these guys?  I don't need immediate knock down, just something that will wipe out the bulk over a few days so that I can get in there and cut the bush down to drag it off.

I don't think those ""hot shot"" type sprays will work because I can't tell where the nest is."

While messing around in there, I will be adding some downlights.

[Inked photo for reference](https://i.imgur.com/zu4na0G.jpg), the existing sconces are marked in black, yellow for the new downlights, red for the new outlet.

The front (i.e. exterior) wall of the garage has the box with the power feed and switches for both the inside garage lights and existing outside garage lights (wall sconces on either side of the 16' door). I plan to add another switch there to feed the new soffit downlights. Now I am thinking that I will extend that box yet another space (4 gang total) to either a.) add a GFCI outlet to then daisy chain the soffit outlets from, or b.) add another switch to switch for the soffit outlet and have the GFCI outlet outside.  

Do you see any problems with that, or other things I should consider? I know having sconces + downlights is a little belt and suspenders, but my wife likes the look of the sconces and I don't want to have to fill the holes or replace the boards where the sconce boxes are now. 

If I were to run christmas lights from a soffit outlet on the far left side of the house, it would be about 100 feet of lights to get to the right side, following the gutter line. That would be fine to all run from a single outlet, right? [These lights at HD](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Home-Accents-Holiday-34-ft-100-Light-Mini-LED-Warm-White-String-Lights-with-Green-Wire-L9100174WU01/308103573) are 33 ft long, and say that you can daisy chain up to 30 sets of them together, for a total of 1,000 ft of light.

Is it crazy to redo the kitchen? I figure it could be much more functional and aesthetically pleasing. My family is all tradesmen, so labor would be paid for with pizza and beer. Meaning I‚Äôd be able to do it for sub $2500.

Everything I seem to see about kitchen renovations says they‚Äôre often not worth it, too much hassle, etc, but has anyone done a very small kitchen for very little money and found it to be worth the time and cost?"

Basement Remodel Cost? Pictures are linked.,HomeImprovement,1,dicpxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dicpxs/basement_remodel_cost_pictures_are_linked/,2,1571195430.0,"Hi,

My husband and I just bought a house that was built in 1987 in a big college town in Michigan. The basement has one side that is finished and one side that is not. The finished side has never been updated, but it is very dry, warm, doesn't have any signs of water damage, and passed inspection recently. The finished space is 22ft x 10ft with a drop ceiling. Due to a gas leak, part of the walls, soffit, and the ceiling have been ripped up and we finally are deciding to hire someone to update the finished side. [Link to pictures here](https://imgur.com/a/9K0bAJB).

We have no idea what this might cost us, and I'm struggling to find a reliable quote online. I've already reached out to two contractors and am waiting to hear back.

We are looking for new drywall (currently popcorn textured and painted over. I'm told it is easier to start over rather than scrape), new cheap carpet, a painted black exposed ceiling (because of our gas leak, we prefer to keep everything exposed), updating the stairs drywall and carpet, and an addition of can lights - maybe also some outlets. There is one door and frame into the unfinished area that would be included in the remodel.

Could anyone give us a clue as to what this might end up costing us? I was hoping under 10k, maybe closer to 5-7k. Am I even close with this estimation? Would us doing our own demo help with cost - or is that a bad idea?

Any help is appreciated!"

"Basement reno questions, from insulation to foundation crack to mice",HomeImprovement,2,di998x,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/di998x/basement_reno_questions_from_insulation_to/,3,1571181056.0,"I am just starting to gut my basement and plan on refinishing it in my spare time. The house was built in 2008 and I am located in Ottawa Canada.

first question: the builder of the home has these [off cuts of 2x4 and 2x6](https://imgur.com/oq2tdLN) - [a second example](https://imgur.com/8QoJVZy) randomly tacked to the inside of the rim joists. They don't seem to follow any logic as to where they are installed, but there are several throughout all four foundation walls. Sometimes there is one all by itself and in other spots there are two or three all bunched close together. What are they for or why are they there? I started prying them off but then I figured I should find out why first.

(Also - is it normal to only have 1.5 to 2 inches of depth from the rim joist to the edge of the sill plate? Looking at other people's rim joist pictures on here they are typically very deep, seemingly 12 to 16 inches deep?)

After removing the existing framing and insulation batts, I noticed a [small crack in the foundation above a window.](https://imgur.com/fSvgHTt) This window takes significantly more force to open than the other window in the basement and am wondering if the sagging concrete is weighing down on the window itself? The window is not impossible to open, just... challenging. I don't really plan on ever opening the windows down there after the basement is finished anyway, so should I be concerned at all with this? The crack penetrates through to the outside of the foundation, although it's smaller on the outside than the inside.

The builder had [this tar paper](https://imgur.com/xgpx1eO) tacked to the foundation wall just as you see it everywhere that they had it insulated with insulation batts. They apparently did a pretty piss poor job as they missed a good foot of wall space all the way around. Can I take this down? I'm on the fence about how I'm going to re-insulate the walls but I'm leaning towards a 2"" rigid foam board behind the 2x4 framing and then 2x4 batts in the stud cavity.

(Do I still need a vapor barrier over the stud cavity if I have the two inch foam board right against the concrete wall?)

One of my most pressing concerns is that I have now completely gutted the whole basement right to the bare walls and all the rim joist cavities are wide open. With a cold winter coming coupled with the fact I poke around at this in my spare time I definitely won't have it all sealed back to air tight by the time it gets to be minus 20 celsius or colder here. I can handle it just being frigid in the basement and paying some extra heating bills in the meantime. What I can't have is condensation / rot in the rim joist and sill plate area. What is the likelihood of this happening?

Lastly, I have a natural gas fireplace that overhangs the foundation wall and the rim joist cavities in this spot are really deep, like almost 24"". I am getting a ton of mice and pest droppings from this area and they are getting in somehow. What is the best material to use to prevent them from gaining access in this area? The pink fiberglass batts did me no favors here as they were absolutely littered with nests, burrowed holes and covered in poop beyond anything I'd ever seen.

Thanks very much for your time and help."

My wife and I just bought a house in Montreal, Canada. While we are happy with the home in general, the brick siding is in bad shape (severe chipping and cracks) and we would like to replace it some time soon. We noticed that this is an issue on many of the houses on our street, thus we suspect that the clay bricks that were used to build the houses in our neighborhood were cheap or not cooked well enough.

The entire front of the house is covered in full-brick siding, while the sides and rear of the home only has brick on the first floor, with new vinyl siding on the second. Ideally, we'd like to replace the existing brick siding of the entire house with new full-bricks (not a veneer), while keeping the vinyl on the sides and rear of the second floor as they are in good shape.

Would such a project be feasible? How much do you estimate it would cost?

All but 1 of the contractors (4 of 5) suggested I skip the tyvek and just go right over top of the insulbrick with 3/4"" insulation that is well taped, then do aluminum siding over that. Are there any risks to this approach? 

The exterior wall in question is 28 inches from my neighbour, so code (I'm in Toronto, ON) requires I use aluminum siding, not vinyl.

I'd appreciate any thoughts/advice."
Having huge fluctuations in cast iron baseboard heating.,HomeImprovement,1,dia2vn,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dia2vn/having_huge_fluctuations_in_cast_iron_baseboard/,10,1571184613.0,"I just tried out our baseboard heat for the first time in our new to us house built in 1952.

It has nice looking cast iron baseboard heat.  The problem is trying to get a constant temperature.  I have huge runs of the radiators- kind of seems like overkill.

I am guessing this cycle is happening- call for heat, let‚Äôs say 68 degrees, my furnace is sending 185 degree water to the radiators, the thick heavy radiators heat up and retain the heat, by the time the thermostat shuts down the zone, I have super heated cast iron blasting heat, and the inside temperature goes to 80 degrees.

Repeats the cycle after thermostat calls for heat again.


I installed nest  thermostats and used them for years in my prior house.  My prior house had cheap baseboard radiators and I did not have this overshooting experience.

Am I on track here with my diagnosis?

What can I due to reduce the fluctuations?

Help raising toilet floor,HomeImprovement,1,dia04d,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dia04d/help_raising_toilet_floor/,5,1571184271.0,"Hello everyone!

We recently bought a Victorian semi-detached house in the UK, have been doing a little at a time (refinishing floors, peeling wallpaper off etc.) and we have now tackled one of the most interesting features: the outdoor toilet. At the end of the kitchen there was this toilet that could only be accessed from the outside. Not a fan (also 8 months pregnant so wanting as many toilets as possible). So we turned it into an indoor toilet, with the help of some lovely builders. And we discovered that the toilet is roughly half a meter lower than the rest of the house. Enter the title of this post. 

You can see the toilet here [https://imgur.com/a/AVBfcfi](https://imgur.com/a/AVBfcfi) , sorry you can't really see the floor height difference because I took a terrible picture.

We have never tackled anything like this before, we do have a plumber coming in to sort out a wash basin, that doesn't exist currently. The toilet is 150cmx80cm. 

My idea of how to go about it was to:

1-remove all the tiles, wallpaper etc from the walls, remove the toilet

2-build another joisted floor at the correct height (what size timbers would you recommend for this?) & cover with plywood, then Ditra, then tile on top

3-affix plasterboard to the walls, maybe insulate the external wall with Celotex under the window

4-decorate

Does this makes sense? Am I missing something? Would a flange extender be the right thing to use when we get to installing a new toilet or is there more to it?

I think stripping the paint on the decking and either staining the wood or re-painting would be the way to go, but I have not done that before.

I could just follow the striping and do the white in the divets and the purple on the ""normal"" wall space.

Stuck in a hotel with my mind spinning on endless possibilities.

My home was heavily damaged in a micro burst/ possible tornado 3 weeks ago in Tucson Az. The home was originally build in 76 and was fully remodeled in 2016. Its a 4 brm, 2 bath, flat roof home with an open floor plan. The storm ripped off my A/c unit and roof and threw it down the road leaving the decking exposed over the entire house. It then continued to down pour for the rest of the night soaking everything within the house. Water was pouring out of base boards as it traveled down within the walls, light fixtures became water feature, and my skylight became down spouts. Everything was destroyed in seconds. Its was a rough night!

**Demo-** Since then the house has been gutted down to the studs to stop the spread of mold and mildew. Personal belongings stored away off site, Cabinets, carpet, fixtures and drywall have all been thrown out.

**The Wait/ planning-** The house has had the roof decking replaced where it was needed and a built up roof has been applied. The house is now dried in and is at a stand still while the insurance adjusters do their thing.  In an attempt to turn this wait period into a positive I've been trying to look up modern upgrades to put into our classic slump block home. Everything needs to be redone. So any ideas or upgrade ya'll have done or thought of to make your home life easier, more relaxing, more fun or just cool, I'm all ears!

There is currently 3-4 inches of rock wool between the joists in the attic as the only insulation.  I would like to bring my home up to R-38, as it is the current code.  The rock wool was put up there sometime in the 40's, judging by the dates on the newspapers that were used to line the back of the plaster walls.  It is dusty, but I don't see any mold or animal feces.

My plan is to fill the joists with blow in insulation, then lay fiberglass bats on that to hit R-38. Should I remove the rock wool first, or just blow the cellulose on top?  If I take out the rock wool, I can much better inspect for gaps or holes in the envelope.  Also, I could put down a vapor barrier before blowing the cellulose in - I am assuming this would be ""more correct"". 

Of course the cons are more time to remove, and more money to refill the space. Will I gain much from installing a vapor barrier?  Also, I have read from some sources that blow in cellulose does a decent job ""sealing the envelope"" with small gaps, so an extremely thorough investigation might be unneeded. Appreciate any input"

Quick backstory. First time home owner  trying to renovate my open concept living space with a DIY Ikea kitchen install, new flooring to follow. Amatuer DIY or home construction experience, I'm learning from YouTube and getting help from experienced friends. I'll do my best to explain 

Here's my dilemma, I'm not sure where to put the island. Where I have the island base right now, which is where I think I want it, would measure out to;

-6ft from island to cabinets/oven/fridge
-36""ish from side of island to pantry/sink side
-10ft from island to back wall where the dining area would be
-46"" from island to where the side of the couch will be on the living room side (this placement is also aligned with the hallway wall) 
-roughly 5ft diagonally from island corner to top of stairs 

http://imgur.com/gallery/mZfN73h

The real problem for me is putting the island too close to the top of the stairs. If it was at a standard 4ft from the oven that would place it directly at the top of the stairs, creating a tight walkway between the hallway, kitchen entrance, island and couch while also leaving what I think is an unnecessarily large dining area behind it. I have a blank slate so I'd like to make the most of the space provided but I can't tell if having 6ft of workspace is too much.

What I'm thinking of doing is burying 2x6s about 3-4 inches into the ground with some gravel or sand surrounding them. Where the three roots are getting closer to the walkway, I was going to cut away some of the material on inboard 2x6 so it hard room to grow under the walkway a bit without breaking it. so I'd have a 2x6 on each each of the walkway and then a center rib as well down the length of the walkway (about 40'). Then I would screw trex or some other composite decking boards for the walking path into the 2x6s.

Settling foundation on 80 year old home,HomeImprovement,5,di216s,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/di216s/settling_foundation_on_80_year_old_home/,16,1571139248.0,"I have an 80 year old home in the PNW that is settling on one side. I recently had a local contractor come out to take a look and he quoted me $17k to install 9 helical piers plus steel reinforcement support along the foundation to lift the house ~2"" back to level (along with some concrete work). 

I'm OK with paying for the work, but wanted to get second opinions about how urgent / necessary the work is. I understand having a settling house isn't ideal and can cause longer term damage, but the house is also sitting on it's original foundation and has been doing so for 80 years.

The contractor said that his guess is the lot was backfilled during building since it's on a slight hill and the soil has just been compacting over time. Whether the settling is more recent is unknown (I've owned the house under a year but haven't noticed any significant changes since purchasing).

I'd appreciate any feedback on the urgency of the fix, along with the helical pier solution and cost. From my research, the company is reputatable and the cost seems reasonable for the area but any further information would be great."
Replacing a fused AC connection with a GFCI?,HomeImprovement,8,dhybuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dhybuh/replacing_a_fused_ac_connection_with_a_gfci/,2,1571121191.0,"We bought a house about six months ago. The house has a lamp post out front. The lamp post is wired to the house with an underground wire which goes up into an outdoor gang box with a blank plate. I turned off the breaker and opened it up. Inside are neutral, ground, and hot wires wired from an outlet on the opposite side of the wall. These are connected to the wire that runs underground. There is a 10A fuse on the hot leading to the underground wire.

The fuse isn't blown, but it has corroded significantly to the point that it's no longer functioning. I'd like to replace it, but I would also like to add an outdoor outlet to the box, since there aren't any at the moment. I'm thinking of replacing the box with a two-gang box and throwing an outdoor GFCI outlet in the right side. What I'd like to do is put a GFCI on the left side, but one that doesn't have an outlet, it just runs to the wire that then goes out to the lamp post. 

Is this possible? I have not had good luck finding a GFCI without an outlet, but I think there's a good chance my search terms are off. Additionally, is the fuse necessary? I was thinking that it wouldn't be if I've got a GFCI in there, since I assume that water/catastrophic wire failure are the primary reason for the fuse.

(I'm not sure if it matters, but I'm also planning on replacing the lamp post, after getting into it I found that it was in the process of rusting away and was almost ready to fall over. I want to take care of everything while I'm already messing with the wiring.)"

I want to light up the room with simulated day light but also have the option to dim at night.  I replaced the 3 incandescent 40w bulbs with 60w LEDs that are supposed to be like simulated day light, but it's still not bright enough.  Also, since my ceilings are only 9' and the ceiling fan from ceiling down to the tip of the cap that keeps the light cover on is 2', so it takes up a lot of headroom.  

I'm thinking about replacing that ceiling fan with a low profile model that is about 11.5"" from ceiling to bottom.  I'm thinking it should have no built-in light, for a cleaner look.  Then I am thinking of having maybe 4 recessed/can lights installed into the ceiling.   I'll stick LED bulbs into them so it doesn't get too hot in my room.  Do you think this will do the trick and fill my room with bright daylight-like lighting while also making my vertical space feel taller and make my room feel a little more spacious because of the lower profile ceiling fan?

Advice for asbestos abatement,HomeImprovement,4,dhycsm,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dhycsm/advice_for_asbestos_abatement/,19,1571121309.0,"Hi, I hope this is the right place to ask for advice on how to go about my asbestos predicament. 

The house in question is built in 1983 and  located in Ontario, Canada. 

A few months ago, a leak developed in the basement ceiling, where there is Artex decorative plaster moulding. Now, I'm aware that this material is known to contain asbestos. To my great horror, I learned that my parents hired a (negligent) handyman to cut a 1.5 ft wide hole in the ceiling at the location of the leak, without consulting me first. The surrounding area is now covered in dust, presumably containing asbestos, and there is a large gaping hole in the ceiling. 

The US banned asbestos in construction in 1977, but to my knowledge, Ontario did not ban asbestos until 1986. Furthermore, existing supplies were used until 1992, and illegally thereafter well into the late 90s. Therefore, do I have grounds for suspecting that the Artex mould, or any other material in the basement ceiling, contains asbestos?

If yes, what should be the next course of action? 

 1) Do I assume that the dust contains asbestos in the interim and make sure no one enters the area? 

2) Should I hire an asbestos abatement contractor to collect samples and send it off for testing, as well as to clean up the mess? How much can I expect to pay? 

 3) How should the hole in the ceiling be filled to minimize asbestos release and exposure? 

4) My parents, out of ignorance or blatant irresponsibility, seem unfazed by the possibility of asbestos. How do I convince them otherwise, apart from it being illegal to disturb known asbestos-containing materials in Ontario?"

The details: **Imaging shows moisture below two of the showers and in the lower tile area; in one shower there were visible issues but in the other it was visibly passable.** Inspector assumed we need to tear out and replace show pan with one with visible issues, which would lead to redo of the shower. Inspector didn't take issue with the second one, probably b/c it didn't show any visible issues - but we're assuming that if there's moisture showing in the pan and lower tile area it's perhaps the same issue even if we can't see it?   


Notes: the house hasn't been occupied for a few months, so is it weird there's moisture if showers haven't been run? Also - mold tests were negative in these restrooms, so hopefully thats a good thing?

Replacing exterior French doors. Reviews on all manufacturers (except for possibly very high-end) seem to be meh. Basis budget, going with steel Jeld-Wen from a big box. Using a local contractor to install.

Two questions:

1. Specifically, anything I should be wary of with Jeld-Wen? Reviews seem to be either like or hate.
2. I want screens.  Not fond of sliders that Jeld-Wen offers for French doors. Not a fan of retractable, either. Is there a kit of some sort where I can use regular screen doors instead of sliders or retractable? (Yes, could ask contractor, but more want to tell him what he's going to be doing/using in advance rather than the inconvenience of him needing to source what I want.)

Thank you so much in advance!"

Chipping away self leveling?,HomeImprovement,1,di1wtk,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/di1wtk/chipping_away_self_leveling/,5,1571138644.0,"I'm in the middle of a basement renovation and recently got the carpet pulled up, only to reveal what seems to be a lot of self  leveler poured around a raised concrete section. My goal is lay down vinyl plank. 

All this self leveler is poured in what used to be a bedroom, but I've taken down the (non load bearing) walls. In some sections the leveler is a one inch ridge to the concrete foundation, and this ridge exists where the walls used to be. The ridge sort of tapers off along the edge of the previous bedroom until it's flush with the foundation elsewhere.

I was thinking I'd need a concrete grinder and a full day to get rid of all these raised sections, but when I was pulling up the tack for the concrete this self leveler just broke off. I started chipping at the edges of it and it broke away really easily.

I'm thinking I can chip away at as much as I can, then grind away whatever else needs to be taken care of. Does this seems like a reasonable way to go about it? I'm sure I'll need a grinder for the raised concrete section, the reason the self leveler seems to be here in the first place, but I've read grinding concrete is a slow and tedious process. So I figure chipping away at this stuff can save me a lot of time.

I'm not really aiming for a level floor, just a flat one. If all this seems OK, is there a faster way to chip this off besides a pry bar and mallet? One that doesn't damage the foundation.

Every winter, I notice some crazy drafts coming out of around my gas fireplace. Since it's fall, now's a great time to look into why before the cold weather hits. I've shut off the nat gas and capped the line. The drafting is extra super obvious and is coming from the chimney pipes that are used as conduit for the 3"" intake and exhaust pipes. There is a pic below with 2 arrows pointing where drafting is coming from. 

I've pulled up the owner's manual online from my fireplace model, and the intake/exhaust piping appears to be the right type, within spec in terms of the distance to the top of the chimney (less than 35'). It has a proper cap according to the book.  Is there anything that I can do that is safe to block the drafting air?  Or is the cool air intake somehow a safety precaution that is required in case of a leak from the aluminum piping?

My last resort  is to simply keep the gas line capped, cap the chimney pipe, and put in an electric log (for looks, not heat) behind the glass/inside my gas insert. Id prefer to lose the heat source & eliminate the cold draft. the central air system in the house is sufficient to regulate temperature.

I still may replace it to avoid a surprise later, but I think there is another issue that needs to be resolved. Here is the data:

Water heater set on B (140 degrees according to manual) - Kitchen 130, Bathroom A 130, Bathroom B (with shower) 130, Shower 110. All 3 faucets have hot/cold handles, while the shower is one total (turns left and right to choose temperature)

Water heater set on Very Hot (160 degrees according to manual) - Kitchen 145, Bathroom A 145, Bathroom B (with shower) 145, Shower 125

So I'm getting 20 degrees less consistently out of the shower than any of the faucets. A guy I had out for a quote said to get a plumber to check out mixing valves throughout the house.

Before paying someone for all that... is there anyway to easily do this myself? Where would they be located usually? I'm an amateur for sure with plumbing (stuck drains, toilet, snake usage, p-trap cleanout), so anything tough is above my pay grade. I get that 125 is probably going to be hot enough for her now, but it also makes the other faucets dangerous with a small child, so not a great option to just leave the water heater on megablast."

Water heater flue gases and humidity dumping into fireplace,HomeImprovement,2,dhxla9,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dhxla9/water_heater_flue_gases_and_humidity_dumping_into/,1,1571118017.0,"Hi there, I'm trying to find the best solution to a problem I just noticed in my new-to-me 1917 house.

Since the furnace is high efficiency, only the water heater now vents into a flue of the chimney. We were notified of some backdrafting problems at the water heater by the contractors who sealed up our basement box sills with spray foam. I double checked with a carbon monoxide meter, found none, figured I'd wait a while to address this problem.

This weekend, I went to build a wood fire in the fireplace and was knocked back by humid, warm air. The water heater was catching up after a shower and it was clearly dumping a ton of moisture into the fireplace opening. It was condensing on the damper and dripping down. I grabbed the CO monitor - still okay on that front. But this seems like much more humidity and flue gases than was coming via backdrafting at the heater itself.

The seller rebuilt the chimney from the ground up and it got cleared by a chimney mason with a cursory inspection. The below ground portion of the chimney is original and caked in efflorescence, but the same mason said not to worry. I can't identify any obvious defects that would connect the water heater flue to the fireplace flue, but the massive humidity tells me otherwise. Even without measurable CO, I'm worried about flue gases exhausting into the living space and about corrosive moisture eating away at the chimney. Presumably the seller only rebuilt the chimney because it was in rough shape - I'm guessing I found one reason why that might be.

Two ideas come to mind, and I'm not sure of their relative benefit or relative costs. One would be to go straight over to a direct vent water heater, the kind that derives its combustion air and exhausts its flue gases from a single coaxial pipe through the side wall of the basement. No more issues with backdrafting, no way for any flue gases to enter the house ever again.

The other would be to install a metal liner into the water heater flue to safely and completely conduct flue gases to the top of the chimney as intended.

Our water heater is from 2011 and seems to be in fine shape, so it seems a shame to kick it to the curb now. But I'm leaning toward the direct vent water heater to solve the issue once and for all.

Has anyone every dealt with this before? What would you do?"

Undercabinet Lighting Questions,HomeImprovement,2,dhtfhn,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dhtfhn/undercabinet_lighting_questions/,4,1571101054.0,"First off, I will say that I've researched this quite a bit and am just getting a little lost. I've done my best to figure out how to do this but just have some questions that I'm struggling with.

To start, the setup:

Fairly small kitchen, opens into the dining room so three walls that will have base and upper cabinets. It's down to the framing at the moment, so I don't know what kind of cabinets will be put in exactly.

I'm trying to figure out the best way to rough in wiring for the undercabinet lighting that I'd like to have, because I don't want to go the battery route. So here's my thoughts so far:

I want to do the low-voltage transformer way. So I will run my line to a junction box for the lights, and send a couple lines to a two-gang box that will hold my switches for the undercab lights and the main overhead lights.

From the undercab switch, I'll run 14/2 through the wall and up to a 1-gang box a few inches from the ceiling that will house an outlet for my transformer, which can sit on the upper cabinet (neither of which I have yet).

From the transformer, I can drop lines how I feel behind the cabinets and into LED pucks or whatever I feel like, and since it's low voltage on top of the cab I won't have to worry too much about routing through walls or around corners. The extra plug up top will also make accent lighting easier if I so choose.

Does this all make sense? I've seen some people rough 14/2 straight through the drywall in the general area of where the bottom of the wall cabinets will be, but that seemed difficult to plan since I don't have the cabinets, and also seemed overkill for LEDs. 

So basically: Line -> Switch -> High Outlet -> Transformer -> LEDs

Hello! I am planning on pretty much gutting my kitchen and remodeling it. Replacing piping, running gas lines in (currently has electric appliances), and possibly knocking down a wall between my living room and kitchen. As such I want to focus on ease of movement and practicality of my kitchen.

I have brainstormed and neared a dead end creatively speaking. Main Concerns:

1. The **entryway** from my home (I have 2 doors on the front of my home, but one leads to an entryway area linking the kitchen/garage/basement/small closet). Coming from the entryway, going up the 3 steps to the kitchen feels very claustrophobic. I considered getting rid of the closet that is between the door and my kitchen, and maybe maybe the steps wider. Or cutting an opening in the wall and adding a counter top directly above the handrail. Essentially getting rid of a third to half of the closet space. And possibly adding a second cupboard door on the side of the kitchen (for a double sided pantry). Thoughts, opinions, alternate ideas?
2. Partially knocking down **the wall between kitchen and living room**. My family thinks I should knock down the wall completely. I am opposed to this as kitchen sounds will travel much easier on the open floor plan- and my living room/dining room is already one large rectangle. I have considered widening the existing opening, getting rid of the door frame and using columns instead. OR adding a passageway so you can walk more easily from the kitchen area to the patio french doors in the living room/dining room.

Here are some pictures (any big grey/white boxes are just me using MS paint to hide my clutter).  
The last couple photos are the floor plans and my ideas for layouts. Shape of my kitchen is like a rectangle, except for the one corner where a smaller rectangle was cut out for the entryway area. Kitchen is approx. 11.25 ft wide at most parts, and 9.5 ft for the rest. Kitchen Length=approx 15ft at its longest. And approx length of 9.5ft at it's shortest

I would like to be able to dampen the sound somehow in our shared walls I can attach removable things to walls but I can't start construction I'm in a rented house. Unsure on the best course of action. 3 of the adjoining rooms have 2 alcoves each too, have tried putting wardrobes/other furniture in them which didn't really help.

Was thinking foam pads but from what I can tell this will make our sound more clearer in here with less echo but not really stop the barking. Moving blankets I've seen spoke about but was unsure if they are any good?

Windowsill warped and pulling away from house - Can I fix it myself?,HomeImprovement,6,dht2qa,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dht2qa/windowsill_warped_and_pulling_away_from_house_can/,2,1571099592.0,"Images here: [https://postimg.cc/gallery/1hqbqw14y/](https://postimg.cc/gallery/1hqbqw14y/)

I recently noticed that the outside part of a windowsill was bowed out in the center and pulling away from the house (taking some siding with it). As far as I can tell, the paint had worn off, leaving bare wood, so it started absorbing moisture and warping. Is it as easy as just pulling off the old piece, cutting a new one to size, and nailing back on and sealing/repainting? Are there other hidden things I need to worry about?

Background: house is in Denver, Colorado. I'm reasonably handy, but don't have a garage or workshop and thus don't have many power tools (though I can rent if needed). They've never been tested, but the siding panels almost certainly contain asbestos (built in 1953)."

We've upgrade insulation in the attic and siding, and saw a small improvement the next year, but not as much as we'd hope.

If we were to install a split duct, would it replace both the heating and cooling? What if we only used it for heating and let the traditional AC run in the warmer months? Should we remove the heat pump afterward, or just leave it alone in the attic?

I've gotten a few quotes, including one for filling the gaps and repairing the cracks with hydraulic cement for $1600 and one for rebuilding the entire staircase for $6K. The side wall material is renaissance stone and apparently lets water right through, which them freezes, expands and cracks the concrete and it repeats. We also salt the steps, which I am learning is not the thing to do.

How best to update this overhead bedroom storage?,HomeImprovement,1,dhudt1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dhudt1/how_best_to_update_this_overhead_bedroom_storage/,2,1571104911.0,"My master bedroom has a 3' deep overhead storage area running the length of the room. At some point a few decades back someone installed some homemade sliding bypass panels out of about 3/16"" painted plywood in metal tracks about 3/16"" deep. Pictures here: [https://imgur.com/gallery/YarbCBc](https://imgur.com/gallery/YarbCBc)

I'm planning to upgrade the access to a rolling ladder something like this: [https://www.amazon.com/DIYHD-SLD-8FT-Sliding-Hardware-Stainless/dp/B071ZVS9GB](https://www.amazon.com/DIYHD-SLD-8FT-Sliding-Hardware-Stainless/dp/B071ZVS9GB)

But when I do, I'd like to upgrade the panels and tracks too. I like the bypass style and the fact that the thin plywood gives it a nearly flat look. But the track sections have gotten old and somewhat misaligned and the panels no longer slide well and sometimes pop out of the tracks altogether. I'd be happy with some newer, deeper tracks, maybe with new (similarly thin) plywood. Or a bypass that just lets the panels hang but keeps them close together.

But I haven't been able to find the thin plywood sheets at my local Lowes or Home Depot (am I looking in the wrong places?) And haven't been able to find good new tracks either.

Looking around the house I've noticed that some of my walls have a texture similar to popcorn ceilings.. I took some pictures in to our local Lowes and Menards stores and they're up in the air by the pictures if it's just texture or if they actually rolled plaster on some of the walls. 

Anyway. Right now I have half textured walls (some of which are covering cracks in the plaster) and some smooth walls (painted drywall). At this point, does it make more sense to sand down the plaster to have smooth walls? Or keep the textured walls as a way to hide any imperfections left behind by tenants?

Replacing barrier between brick facade and studs,HomeImprovement,1,dhuchk,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dhuchk/replacing_barrier_between_brick_facade_and_studs/,1,1571104769.0,"Hi all,

I'm hoping you can help me with something.  I read the FAQ/Rules and I have tried to follow them and provide everything.  Apologies if I've missed anything.

A few weeks ago our carpet was soaking wet after a heavy rain.  After examining a number of things, I found that water was coming in from a bad downspout, down our brick, and seeping through into the interior.  So I tore down the dry wall (covered in mold), pulled out the insulation, and the plywood between the brick and the outside of the wall was sopping wet, moldy, and rotted.  Here are pics after taking things down:  [https://imgur.com/a/THrqbSL](https://imgur.com/a/THrqbSL) 

I've had roofer and gutter guys come to fix the problem the water routing problem and a masonry contractor is fixing and sealing the brick.  I'll be scrubbing the studs to remove mold and removing the rest of the old plywood barrier (at least in the parts where there is mold/rot).

So now I have to put everything back together on the interior.  The problem is that I don't know what to in the space between the studs and the brick.  There used to be a plywood barrier with (I think) tar paper on the outside.  But that was put on the house from the outside and so there's no way to do that now.  I have no idea what to put there now.  Should I try to put plywood between the studs and insulation on that?  I assume there's code that I need to follow. Any advice very much welcomed.  Hoping to do it myself as I'm pretty handy, but if I have to call someone in it'd be great to know the type of contractor you'd contact.

I live just outside Seattle, Washington, King County."

Furnace not kicking on: think intake is clogged,HomeImprovement,2,dhr14d,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dhr14d/furnace_not_kicking_on_think_intake_is_clogged/,17,1571090758.0,"My furnace isn't kicking on when called and I think it's because a squirrel brought a bunch of leaves and acorns into the intake pipe.

I opened up the covering of the burners and found a bunch of leaves in there, cleaned it out as best I could (meaning all the leaves that were visible are now gone) and the furnace was able to kick on and run even after putting the cover back on. It got the house up to temp but won't kick back on as long as the burner cover is off. I've repeated this process four times now. I take the cover off, it kicks on, replace the cover it will run until the thermostat shuts it off. Then it won't kick back on unless I take the cover off the burners.

To me, this suggests it can't pull enough air through the intake to get started but can get enough to run once it's going.

My question is, how do I clean out the intake pipe? It looks like someone has done work on the intake PVC because there are a ton of joints but they all are glued up and I can't pull them apart. I have pics of the visible section but then there's another 20 feet of run in a soffit that I don't have access it. Then it comes out in the backyard.

[Pic 1](https://imgur.com/a/St90rF9) is the air intake connecting to the burner, you can see there's a joint just after it enters the furnace.

[Pic 2](https://imgur.com/a/ys8ePzy) & [Pic 3](https://imgur.com/a/Xvjrd9S) : You can see all the joints here probably from an old repair. I can't open any of these up manually, they're glued up pretty good.

[Pic 4](https://imgur.com/a/rCblmeg) PVC runs across ceiling and then away into soffit out of reach for ~20 feet until it comes out of the back of the house.

Does my assessment make sense that the ignition problem is due to a clogged intake? 

What's the best way to clean this entire run? I need to get this going today because it's fairly cold at night and there's pressure to ""call someone."""

"Project idea - rotating table ""extension"" (looking for advice)",HomeImprovement,1,dhrdpv,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dhrdpv/project_idea_rotating_table_extension_looking_for/,2,1571092365.0,"Hi guys!

&#x200B;

*First of all, I apologize if I'm posting in the wrong reddit, I couldn't find a more suitable place.*

*I figured I'd post here and ask for an advice regarding a project idea that I'm in need of.*

&#x200B;

Now onto the point; I've got a scrap MDF board (I think) and I would like to somehow attach it to my to my table but also  make sure I can rotate it when needed. It would serve as an extension of the table in a shape of a letter ""L"".

&#x200B;

I don't need it to be pretty, just functional since this is more of a utility table than anything else, I just keep stuff on it.

Let me point out that this is way out of my area expertise, but I tried to come up with an idea nonetheless.

I suggest looking at the mockup 3D model of the idea to get a better picture before reading the text.

&#x200B;

**3D model can be seen here:** [**https://imgur.com/a/c9Taden**](https://imgur.com/a/c9Taden)

*Note: the model is intended to convey an approximation of the idea, it's not a very accurate.*

&#x200B;

**The plan**

&#x200B;

I figured I could drive a bolt trough the table and the board, somehow install a bearing (or 2) into the plank / board and lock it with a nut.  On the other end of the plank, I would drive a long wood screws through cut off wooden handles, the kind commonly used for shovels and similar tools - this handle would function as a support and it would be very easy to adjust  the length by simply twisting it, allowing me to move the newly added plank when needed.

&#x200B;

Additionally, I figured I could perhaps hide the bolt (with a slightly different type of head) by slightly driving it into the table and covering it with a piece of wood vernier or whatever it's called.

&#x200B;

As for the bearings, could I get away with drilling the slots for them with a step drill bit and should I use some kind of glue / epoxy to secure them or would the nuts be enough ?

&#x200B;

And yes, I know that I won't be able to fully hide the board under the table if I use this method but I need the board right at the edge of the table and I can't push it forward due to the table supports.

&#x200B;

*Additional info: Board weights somewhere between 6.5-7KG (14.3-15.3 pounds). Dimensions: 118x32x3 centimeters / 46.45x12.6x1.2 inches. The board is slightly thicker than the table (by 0.5cm).*

&#x200B;

I'm sure this plan has quirks, but do you think it's feasible and is there anything you'd do differently ?

Thanks for taking the time to read the post!"

Converting garage lighting from fixtures to LED 4' shop lights: Some things I've found during my research that,HomeImprovement,1,dhqew2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dhqew2/converting_garage_lighting_from_fixtures_to_led_4/,6,1571087725.0,"Hi all, 

I have been researching the idea of removing the lighting fixtures in my garage and running 4' LED shop lights. The LED shop lights come with a 5ft grounded cord/plug and can be daisy chained. Below are my proposed steps and potential issues. If anyone has done this before or can comment on the code related items, perhaps this can be useful guide for anyone that wants to do this in the future.

One of many references I've found on the The Google: [https://www.garagejournal.com/forum/showthread.php?t=330064](https://www.garagejournal.com/forum/showthread.php?t=330064)  

&#x200B;

1. Power off to lighting circuit. Verify no live power.
2. Removing lighting fixtures - 4"" hex/round plastic receptacle  box. If it is smaller, you might have to buy an adapter to fit the plug.
3. Installation of duplex plugs in box, e.g.  [https://www.amazon.com/Leviton-5042-Duplex-Receptacle-4-Inch/dp/B000HEHCAU?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref\_=oh\_aui\_detailpage\_o07\_s00](https://www.amazon.com/Leviton-5042-Duplex-Receptacle-4-Inch/dp/B000HEHCAU?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00)    
Several possible code issues here:
   1.  Metal cover on plastic receptacle box is a no-no, but appears to be ok in this case since the center screw on the outlet is grounding the cover plate. 
   2. According to NEC 1999, single fastener to hold an outlet is not allowed (i.e. one screw in the center of the outlet). This one is confusing since these things are widely available. I've read in some cases that that the outlet is riveted to the plate but you can buy the plate separately so... is it ok or not?
   3. Another code issue is that GFCI is required for any outlets in garages. Still true at 8ft? Seems like it. Since this is a lighting circuit, it is unlikely to have GFCI. Also, installing a GFCI outlet on the ceiling likely does not meet code due to the need to have ladder to access it. Also, some LED lights may interfere with the GFCI since they may leak a little current when off. Other than the false tripping issue, seems like this requires a GFCI circuit breaker, which complicates things...
4. Hang lights and run cord to receptacles. I don't see many issues here but might need to think about how to support the cord if it droops too much.

Skipping ahead, I had bought weather resistant GFCI and normal GFCI for the circuit I mentioned above. I had big plans to replace the old ones and didn't mind getting a GFCI for every location despite load-side receptacles being protected by GFCI #1 (hindsight). 
Long story short, I miswired the line-load on some and now I am frustrated with the mess I have created. Since I have a GFCI at every location in this circuit, would it be kosher for me to not use the load terminals and instead use both line terminal holes for hot/neutral to essentially wire parallel?

I'm in the process of patching up the tented area with some extra tiles I found, but my concern is that this will just happen again unless I remove all the grout along the walls to allow for expansion.

My question is, how much of a pain is this going to be to DIY (or even to hire someone to do)? I will have to remove the quarter round in the entire kitchen (I removed a small section to confirm that the grout is all the way to the wall, so I assume it's that way throughout). I see that there are some power tool/attachments you can use to remove grout, but unsure if it'd damage the wall/tile. My other option that I'm strongly considering depending on the costs involved is just redoing all 500 sq. ft of tile since even some of the non-tented portions aren't in great shape (several are cracked, several sound hollow) but I don't have enough matching tile.

TLDR: Ceramic tile grouted all the way to wall. Does it make sense to remove the grout along the walls/how painful is that going to be?"

"If you are replacing carpet, pull the carpet yourself and put deck screws into the sub-floor to silence squeaks.",HomeImprovement,850,dgwq0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dgwq0g/if_you_are_replacing_carpet_pull_the_carpet/,147,1570923513.0,"I saw a post this morning about ""what to do when moving into new home"", I put this in a comment but thought it deserved its own post. I apologize I don't have ""during"" photos but I do have a before and after video.

After you pull up the old carpet and pad (don't remove tack strips) remove all the staples with pliers and a flat head screwdriver. Then go to the hardware store and get a contractors box of 500-600 3"" deck screws (or 3 boxes, heh). 

Once the carpet is up, you will be able to tell where the joists are by the nail pattern in the floor. Using an impact drill (or corded drill, a regular battery powered driver might have trouble keeping up) put a decking screw next to the nail at the end of the sheet of plywood, then either put screws next to, or between all the nails, When you are done with each sheet, or room, go through with a hammer and hit all the nails back down, as they will now likely be lifted 1/16 to 1/4 inch. 

We almost didn't buy our house because the floors sounded like you were walking on loose deck planks on a pirate ship. It was horrible. We still have a squeak here or a thud there, but largely, our floors are silent.

[Here is the before video i took during the Inspection.](https://youtu.be/OvNTv3kBHto)

[Here is the after video I took this afternoon.](https://youtu.be/cWBNhML2meM)

Be sure to have knee-pads and some gloves, or you will be sorry. myself and my FIL got my 1900 sq foot home done in a day. The kitchen and entry way had ""nice"" Pergo on them we weren't replacing, so that didn't get done, but I would recommend this to anyone with even the slightest squeaky floor who is going to be replacing carpet. Also be sure the screws have flat heads not domed heads.

It is my understanding that most sub-floring is put in place by nails by builders because it is MUCH faster to sweep through with a nail gun than it is to put screws in. This will be fine for 5 years to a decade but then the heads slowly begin to lift from the floor, and when the plywood rubs on the nail, it squeaks, and if the boards are moving a lot like in my case, it will thud like a stampede of elephants. This is especially prevalent in northern homes when the temperature and humidity swing drastically, causing the wood to shrink and swell with the seasons.

EDIT: The screws for the floors, this is advice for plywood or fiberboard subflooring, and not hardwood floors. Please dont go blasting screws through your beautiful HW floors :-(

Edit 2: be sure to watch out for silly things like pipes through joists or missing the joist entirely and hitting something. Perhaps it‚Äôs best to put all your screws an inch or so from all nails to reduce risk?  Also, someone mentioned 2‚Äù screws might be sufficient, be your own judge based on how thick your sub flooring is. iIRC mine was 3/4‚Äù so I wanted a longer screw to make sure I got enough bite, but also remember, mine was an *extreme* case in terms of noise."
PEX manifolds,HomeImprovement,6,dhevvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dhevvc/pex_manifolds/,4,1571022187.0,"I‚Äôm in the middle of doing a lot of DIY home remodeling and renovations (under guidance of trained pros... at least for the carpentry and electrical) however, we‚Äôre looking for more information on swapping to PEX. We‚Äôre in Tampa, Florida.

We recently had out water main converted from galvanized steel to PVC. This goes from the meter to the softener. At that, we just fed in to the house again using old lines, but we want to convert to PEX. We‚Äôll be taking down the kitchen wall soon which gives us access to all out plumbing connections and when we do that, we‚Äôd like to convert them all to PEX and remove the nearly 70 year old galvanized pipes in the wall. 

That said, the biggest issue I‚Äôm running in to is the manifold and location. We don‚Äôt have a formal garage (car port walled in to make a garage. It‚Äôs small and tight). So while ideally I would put it there, I‚Äôm not sure I physically have the space, which makes me think about putting it in the attic, but I worry about busted lines. The thing is I‚Äôve already ran pvc and cpvc in to redo the water lines before we decided to use PEX. That‚Äôs not too big a deal because I can just use those pipes as a sleeve. Also adding it to the attic makes it incredibly difficult to turn off valves at that location for future work. 


As for the manifold itself, I‚Äôve been looking in to the Viega manablocs. I think we might use the 18 port. Kitchen would use 3 cold and 2 hot. Pot filler, sink, dishwasher, fridge. Two bathrooms so that‚Äôs 3/2 each again. Totaling 9 colds used, 6 hot. I‚Äôve read that I should try to use 3/4‚Äù for the bathtub (second Br is shower only) but the manifold I see is only 1/2‚Äù and 3/8. Is 1/2‚Äù going to be enough? Or should I try to use a combination set up instead of home run? If that was the case, I could have almost everything 1/2‚Äù except one manifold that‚Äôs 3/4‚Äù for the tub? Even then, due to the on demand greater, our GpM is still below what the possible max is. 


Edit: I‚Äôve also read a lot of bad reviews about the copper manifolds that start to leak? Any other information about these or did I get bad info?

I appreciate any input you guys have."

I'm mostly concerned with the foundation as we have a lot of clay in the soil, obviously it's being done all over the place here in southeast Texas with houses on the beach being way higher than what we want (8ft), but I'm confused as to where to start with this.

Do we need to get a geotechnical engineer to analyse the soil? Do we need to talk to just a general contractor? I've already priced and sized the pilings, and ideally would like to do it myself, but I'm not entirely sure if it's realistic or not. 

Thanks for any insights."

Stick-on backslash tile in a rental?,HomeImprovement,2,dhhbvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dhhbvm/stickon_backslash_tile_in_a_rental/,4,1571033150.0,"Edit: title-BACKSPLASH. I'm on mobile and my freakin autocorrect changed the word on me. Sorry :/


Hello everyone!! I currently live in accommodations provided by my employer. Essentially, my salary is reduced in exchange for the apartment, so it's a non-traditional living quarters agreement that works a lot like a rental.

They're looking at remodeling in the next year, but in the meantime I got some stick-on backslash tiles to try out since I heard they're rental friendly and viewed much like wallpaper to landlords:

 https://i.imgur.com/zHy9KFI.jpg


However, since purchasing them, I've seen a different post on some subreddit saying they're a nightmare to remove. If this was a bad landlord I wouldn't care and would be fine with having removal taken out of my deposit, however, I really like my employer and don't want to make it harder on them to remodel later, or if I choose to quit.

For anyone who's ever worked with something like this before: is this stuff that bad to remove? If it is, is there anything I can do to make removal easier later on? I would consider getting a really thin bit of plywood and cutting to the size of my preferred backsplash and nailing that to the wall, so all they'd need to do is pull the board. But if I don't have to, then I'd rather not add to the project costs. I don't quite make enough to throw lots of money at this.

Anyone with experience with these stickons chiming in would be awesome. If knowing my skill level helps, I'm reasonably comfortable with power tools (use a drill and angle grinder regularly at work) and I don't mind taking on unfamiliar projects so long as I can find a good YouTube video to follow along. What I don't actually have are a ton of tools, so if I'd need to purchase a table saw or something, it's not going to be doable for me."

The back end of the garage would have a similar layout as the front, with the center of the gutter piece being higher and angling down towards the corners/downspouts. Sorry if this is hard to visualize; I can draw up a picture if needed.  


We have watched a few videos on installation and know about the .5"" angling for 10' of gutter, as well as making sure snow/ice can runoff over the side of the gutters and not rip them down. 

My questions are:

Is this an appropriate setup? We want to keep the water away from the garage/driveway and so we placed the downspouts on the back. 

Our fascia is about 4"" tall; it seems like near the bottom of the slopes (back corners) the gutters would hang below the fascia. Is that okay?

Once that has had time to set. Put 3 - 4 coats of a black waterproof liquid rubber membrane.

Then ive seen some post using insulation board, and dimple board etc on top. Not sure about using this yet.

I will then fill with gravel / french drain system to an outdoor sump pit and pump it out to the street.

Is liquid rubber a good waterproof material for covering the foundation. As it seems like it would be very hard to go back if it doesn't work out.

Not sure if dimple board or insulation is advised

Installing the blinds involves putting in four brackets, which look like [this](https://i.imgur.com/xaHtbxL.jpg). Each one needs two screws. The instructions say four brackets should be used for any blind length above 75‚Äù. 

I first attempted to put the brackets into the window trim, since that‚Äôs where the previous blinds were installed. Unfortunately, [the trim started to crack](https://i.imgur.com/bqFSTUI.jpg).

Next, I attempted to install them in the drywall above the window. The instructions said that this would require drywall anchors, which I hadn‚Äôt used before. [I went and bought some](https://i.imgur.com/1VKWkso.jpg).

However, when I tried to screw the anchor into the wall, it just span on the tip. The thread didn‚Äôt bite, and it wouldn‚Äôt go in. It left a hole that looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/7nUiyZ2.jpg). I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a stud there. 

(As a side note, I have also realized that those anchors are probably too big, considering how close the two screws that go into the bracket have to be to each other)

You're just creating a goddamned headache for whoever moves in.

We bought our first house four years ago. It looked passable when we moved in and we knew we'd ultimately be doing a complete reno on it once we were settled and our baby had grown some. 

The previous owner tried to ""renovate"" our house by tearing up half the floors and laying 5/8 plywood over the original subfloor. to fix wavy floor issues, then put cheap carpeting down to hide it. This carpet had no ability to stand up to wear and packed down in the high traffic areas within the first year of living there. They also put in Alibaba-purchased Chinese laminate flooring in the dining room. I looked the brand up as I was pulling it out. It's called ""Germany Technique Floor"". That's some serious dedication to be as cheap as fucking possible. Naturally it disintegrated and looked like dogshit within a couple years. 

They also did some other stuff, like ""cuteifying"" the dated kitchen with trim and such. Not only was it completely unnecessary, they used two inch long staples on the trim, missing the studs 80% of the time and wound up piercing a polybutylene water line in the wall leading to a very slow drip inside the wall. 

Now you're probably saying that it should have damaged the wall, but this kitchen has wood paneling on it and for some reason, didn't really take the water like drywall does. The wall was original, of course, so it was on the first layer of subfloor, which is where all the water went soaked in, leaving the floor above it dry. (The crawlspace joists are coated in a layer of foil-faced foam board and were not wet.) We never knew until this year before I started my own renovations and pulled that piece of trim out. A sudden spraying sound in the wall tipped me off and I shut off the water to investigate. The original subloor in that area is now totally destroyed and I have to remove it all. Joists look okay at least. No rot. 

I'm not looking for advice. I just needed to let off steam. I also need a stiff drink and I'd like to exchange a few choice words with whoever did that work."
Alternative way to feed ethernet cable from second floor to first floor,HomeImprovement,3,dh60ac,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dh60ac/alternative_way_to_feed_ethernet_cable_from/,5,1570970125.0,"Hello, its me again. I posted [earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeNetworking/comments/dgpb3f/who_to_call_when_needing_help_installing_an/) about running an ethernet cable outside the living room to my room one floor down. Update: I was able to pull the cable out completely after pulling from the outside. If I continue with that route, I would   

&nbsp;

1. buy an outdoor ethernet cable, 
2. cut the end to feed through the existing hole (the rj45 can't fit in the existing hole left by the original cable), 
3. run it out without clipping neatly to the walls (I don't have the means or a ladder to get it clean) and into my window. Also I'm going to have to read up on grounding(?) because that's important? (It doesn't rain much here and I doubt lightning will ever strike near the side of my building, but this is with my super basic understanding of the subject).
4. (optional) Hire an electrician to do all of the above

&nbsp;

However, i found out that there's a patched up [hole in the wall](https://imgur.com/vx67Cg8) that I'm pretty positive is directly above another [hole in my room](https://imgur.com/7A5xvGK) downstairs. The hole downstairs is from a discontinued home security unit with a hole bunch of different wires coming from the wall. From the upper hole, there only seems to be [one thick wire](https://imgur.com/lrWWPVl) going down that [curves](https://imgur.com/jIwVz8N) inward because of the [protrusion](https://imgur.com/178auJb) its on. (Bonus: What is that speaker box looking thing for?)

&nbsp;

Anyways TLDR: I stuck a long cable down this hole and I didn't see it come out on the other end. Probably because its not a straight down wall. Am I right to assume that they're connected and if so, how can I check and feed a wire down there, with regards to the curve?

Some questions about passive radon mitigation on existing basement sump pit (NW Illinois).,HomeImprovement,2,dh6sii,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dh6sii/some_questions_about_passive_radon_mitigation_on/,6,1570975352.0,"Hi all,

&nbsp;

I am planning on purchasing the original radon / sump dome model number SMR16101-CV for passive radon mitigation on an existing sump pit/pump and have a few questions I was hoping to get answered.This will completely seal my sump pit in hopes of keeping radon gas from entering the house through it.

&nbsp;

I wanted to make sure that a vent is a must, and I am wondering if it's supposed to be vented all the way to the roof (similar to radon mitigation system) or if it could be outside of the house just above the basement. I'm assuming the sump pump won't work efficiently if a vent is not installed since pumping water out will create a vacuum inside the pit and create more ""drag"" for the sump pump.

&nbsp;

Another question I had is with regards to an existing drain in the basement floor that goes straight into the sump pit. After installing this dome, I would have to cover the drain and seal it (to avoid any possible radon gas coming out of it), then find a way to bring my condensate line from the furnace into the pit, as well as the reject water from my water softener. I can easily do that with a condensate pump (think Little Giant pump or something of the sorts), but is it possible to terminate tygon tubing into the dome? I did not see a third hole for such connection. Has anyone else done something similar?

&nbsp;

Lastly, is the vent on the dome specifically for a radon mitigation fan, or just a vent for the pit itself so the pump can put water out without a vacuum inside the pit?

&nbsp;


Once this is all done, I will continue to monitor my radon levels around the house to see if it improves (currently sitting at around 12pCi/l in the basement) and decide if I have to install an active mitigation system.

&nbsp;

Thanks in advance!

Subfloor discolored from minor toilet leak... black mold?,HomeImprovement,4,dh2gnl,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dh2gnl/subfloor_discolored_from_minor_toilet_leak_black/,7,1570950603.0,"1 year old home in North Carolina

We discovered our toilet was dripping/ leaking waste water into our unfinished basement. The plumber took the toilet off, discovered it was grout interfering with the wax seal, so we cleaned and replaced it with a new seal and put the toilet back on. Basically the tile installer left a bunch of grout where the wax seal goes, and the original plumber was too lazy to clean it off and just put the wax seal over the dried grout which obviously didn't create a tight seal. So the source of the leak was an easy fix.   


But my question is about the subfloor underneath the toilet. The leak was never gushing, just a slow drip which created a tiny puddle on the cement floor. We have an unfinished basement so we were able to pull the insulation back and see exactly where the water was coming down through the subfloor under the toiler. The area that is discolored is not very big, however it is pretty dark/black. Is this just because it was waste water (aka poop made it brown)? Or is it mold? Or worse, black mold?! 

Here are the photos from the basement, looking up at the ceiling... [https://imgur.com/a/9Egclo2](https://imgur.com/a/9Egclo2)

The plumber who came to fix the leak seemed totally relaxed and said the subfloor doesn't need to be replaced at all. But i don't exactly trust his opinion. I insisted that it be addressed, so the builder is now going to rip up the tile and replaced the subfloor. Is there not some way to patch/fix it from below (and take advantage of the fact that we have the access from the basement)?   


So the way I see it, we have 3 options:

1. Take toilet off again and rip up tile. Replace subfloor. 
2. Somehow patch or fix from basement below
3. Don't do anything because it's fine? 

It's important to note that cost is not a factor because the house is still under warranty and the builder is paying for any repairs. I want it done right, but I want to save myself the headache of them coming in to rip up the tile. Any time they do work, there's the chance that more will go wrong (e.g. tile laid incorrectly, grout not matching, etc.)"

The houses are very close to each other in the neighborhood I‚Äôm in (Chicago). It‚Äôs also the end of the roofing season.

The roof has a couple layers of shingles on top of cedar shake.

This first roofing company quotes $25K for the roof tear off and replacement. The rationale is that I need all new plywood, cedar shake makes a lot of waste to clean up, and the houses are too close on either side and they have to tarp both and take lots of care. Also the more extreme pitch was called out as a barrier.

This seems absolutely insane for a 950 sq ft home shingle roof tear off. I‚Äôm feeling like this guy just tossed an insane number because he‚Äôs already booked for the end of season and was reaching.

Could use assistance on wiring a ceiling fan in!,HomeImprovement,5,dgyyrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dgyyrq/could_use_assistance_on_wiring_a_ceiling_fan_in/,5,1570933941.0,"Hi, I'm replacing an ugly old ceiling fan with a new one and I'm not sure what to do on the wiring. The old fan had 4 wires: black wht stripe, black, white and green. 

The way it was wired up was: 2 blacks and a white wire nutted to the black on the fan, a single black wire nutted to the black with white stripe on the fan, and neu to neu(white to white). The new fan just has L, Neu, and Gnd (black, white, green).. 

The 2 blacks and white appear to be constant hot even when the switch and breaker is off. The single black is 120v when hot and off when the breaker/switch is off. 

I'm thinking of just putting a wire nut on the one that's always on, and wiring up the single black to the fan, and the single white to the fan, and ground to ground.

I'm not familiar with residential wiring, so any help is appreciated.


Edit: Finally got around to it, I capped off the constant 120v and wired in the single black, white, and ground, and works great! Thanks Guys!"

With the help of my boyfriend, we took the precaution necessary and bought full body suits, respirators, goggles, gloves, sprayer, and a lot of plastic. It took us a full day to prep everything and it turned out really good but the only problem was our tape... when we finally got down to business and began removing the popcorn ceiling, our tape started to fall apart. It was too late to go out and buy new tape. The whole thing became a disaster but we managed and continued on with our work. After we scraped it all off, we wrapped up the second layer of plastic we had on the floor and disposed of it. Then we painted the ceiling to seal in any dust that was left on there and cleaned up and wrapped up the final layer of plastic and disposed of everything. Because our tape was falling off in some areas, some dust and popcorn ceiling fell to the floor and our kitchen & main hvac system was possibly exposed to airborne asbestos & dust. I am planning on adding an orange peel to the ceiling and painting it one last time, after that I want to wipe down the walls with a mop and paint them as well.

I have never thought twice about screwing into a wall to hang things but I bought a good zircon stud finder and it shows AC current detection in the general area on both sides.

Neither spot I marked is directly above an outlet or a light switch - those are at least 1‚Äô or more away.

One wall is shared to the outside of the home backyard near a large window (just a couple inches from the window).

The other wall is shared to the garage, where on the other side are the hot water heater and furnace (both modern gas with electric starters). The hot water heater has two copper pipes going into the wall on the garage side in the same vicinity as where I want to mount the speaker.

This is a modern 2011 home build in a nice area of town, but obviously I can‚Äôt see the interior.

I would be using a screw driver for the 1.5 deep screw screwed about 1.25‚Äù deep. Do I have anything at all to worry about? Any precautions I should take ie turning off all power?

They are wanting to move out of the area, and are considering selling their house. However, there are *numerous* issues, and they're trying to figure out what the first step should be. Here's a summary of the issues:

**Main House:**  
\-- Roof needs repair (\~40+ years old)  
\-- Termite damage  
\-- Unspecified foundation issues  
\-- Out of date ""soft"" factors (needs new carpet, laminate, etc.)

**Rear House:**  
\-- Essentially in disrepair and 100% un-liveable (practically collapsing)  
\-- Has plumbing and electrical that work

**Yard/Driveway:**  
\-- No landscaping  
\-- Driveway concrete will need to essentially be re-done (buckling)

**My Questions:**  
\-- What type of person would they hire as a consultant to do a walk-through and give them *unbiased* advice about what projects to prioritize? i.e., a general contractor, a realtor, etc. Is there a name for this type of inspection?  
\-- Do properties typically need to be in livable condition to be sold (thinking of the back house)? I know that usually there has to be some type of property inspection prior to selling. 

I've included a few photos of the back yard and the rear house that is in disrepair. 

Appreciate any advice!

&#x200B;

In my latest DIY project I will be installing a heated floor in my sunroom (because aside from connecting it, installing it and the tiles on top falls within my reach, a pro will do the electrical connections).

I started by stripping the strange half linoleum, half pressed wood tiles that were there and was happy that it was plywood under (what I wanted).

But... even to my untrained eye, I can clearly see that the plywood has been affected by water in multiple spots on the perimeter, and seem to even have been damaged near the door.

&#x200B;

Now I'm wondering, is this a ""big deal"" in the sense :

\- should I simply try to recaulk everything there is to caulk outside the door/patio doors and then carry on with pouring my cement over the plywood as planned and caulk+cement should be enough protection in future

\- is it slightly more complicated than that (remove siding/door jams) but something I could do (I like to think of myself as the lego generation, i can do a lot with proper instructions)

\- Is it something I should definitely have a pro take care of before carrying on with my heated floor project.

Obviously, DIY because I ain't rich, the material for the heated floor already cut a hole in my current budget :P

Possible foundation problems,HomeImprovement,1,dh36cm,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dh36cm/possible_foundation_problems/,9,1570954246.0,"I bought my house almost 3 years ago (apr 2017).  I bought it through a VA loan. VA is pretty strict on what they allow for inspections. I was right behind the inspector the whole way through. 

I saw a couple of cracks in the Sheetrock and brick. I asked about them and he said they were normal.  Attached is a series of pics of the current cracks that I‚Äôve found. There were two noticeable cracks in 2017. One under the kitchen window and one in the kitchen. 

Now I have noticed the existing cracks expanding and growing. And there are more cracks showing up that weren‚Äôt here before. 

The one in the kitchen was patched before I bought the house. Now it‚Äôs breaking through the patch and getting longer. It has now traveled across the ceiling, into the wall, down the joint and down the wall.  

There was a small hairline crack in the fireplace. It grew and spread until it‚Äôs an 1/8‚Äù gap. Now there is crack on the other side of the fireplace. Now the crown molding above the fireplace is separating from the wood panel. It‚Äôs is the same all the way down the adjacent wall. All of my living room walls have a thin wood paneling instead of Sheetrock. There is a separation in the wood panel that is splitting down the wall right in the middle of the living room. Outside, the fire place has small cracks on one side. Under the living room window the brick seems to be separating from the window sill. Some of the bricks feel loose. 

Upstairs the door jamb for the master bedroom has had pretty drastic paint separation. There is a crack in the ceiling of the stairwell that is right under the AC unit (<‚Äî- possible cause for that one). 

Outside, on the front right corner of the house a small crack has appeared in the last few months. That crack carries around to the side of the house and is pretty sizable. The crack Under the kitchen windows as there during the inspection. It went down about half way down the wall. Now it goes all the way down and there is a noticeable gap (spreading?). Under the half bathroom window (about 6ft away) is another one just like it going all the way down. Some of the brick under that window feels loose. 

Now for the big bad beast. On the other side of the house, there is a pretty nasty looking section of the foundation. There is about 4 ft of rebar showing in the foundation. From the looks of the rebar condition, it‚Äôs been that way for a while. There isn‚Äôt any loose concrete around the exposed rebar. 

My house is on a high point in the neighborhood. The water run off (rain) comes through my property and into my street. I‚Äôm not sure if that kind of water will have an effect on my foundation or not. I‚Äôm thinking it will, but that will be an answer for the experts. 

I really feel like I have some foundation issues. I feel like either the inspector didn‚Äôt know what to look for or he straight up lied to me. I like to think he just didn‚Äôt see things, but I was very specific in asking about the cracks. I‚Äôm going to call a foundation company out to look at it, but I hope someone here can give me a few pointer and maybe tell me I‚Äôm crazy and this is normal settling. 

Edit: it‚Äôs a slab foundation. Houston Tx built in 1974 in a culdesac.

(It happened to be *much* higher than we were expecting and not totally consistent with our design plan or conversation.) 

The other two contractors have not sent estimates and it has been three weeks since they were here. Both did say they would send an estimate in two or three weeks. (One said around two weeks and the other said between two and three.)

In other projects we have had done, we did have several people just blow us off because our projects were on the smaller side. I am assuming that is what is happening here and we should just move on. But, I wanted to get the opinion of some people in the business. Should I follow up with an email to see if they are still interested, or just assume no and move on?
 
If it helps, we are in the metro Atlanta area. It is a really busy market for renovations/flipping/new construction.

Would wrapping the duct with like the same stuff they use in automotive sound deadening work? And then on top of that wrap it in sound blankets and then cross my fingers? 

I was also thinking of just boxing in the duct with drywall and throwing tons of insulation in there.

I have to get out the car (I know, the effort right) and hold the opener to the top of the garage door to get it to work and it's getting worse.

We had to buy a second opener because the previous owner only left one, and it is causing the Same issue. 

I looked at, what I assume is the signal attena dangling down by about 4 inches from the back of the mounted unit.

What is an easy and cheap solution, or is there something I need to do with the rear knobs on the back of the mounted unit?

Note: I've seen some people have signal quality due to LED lights, which the garage doesn't have any LED lights and using the same cars as our old house which used the same company also. So I'm really not sure what to do.

I've just moved into a new apartment and am having problems with the noise coming through the gaos between the door and it's frame.
I have tried those rubbery stick-on thingies, but the problem is the doors are quite a bit twisted, so there are places where the door is up against the frame and on the other side there is still a gap after putting in isolation.
The doors have weird dimensions (American-built apartment complex in Germany), so replacing them is not an option for now."

1. Will WD40 help loosen the severely rusted screws?
2. What is the grey stuff between the metal rails and the glass pane? It's soft and malleable like play-dough. My guess is rope caulk, not glazing putty.
3. How do you recommend I actually remove the metal rails? Insert a flat-head screwdriver under the rail and into the caulk, and see if I can just pop it out? I really don't want to damage the glass.
4. Since it looks like the rope caulk did a shit job of actually sealing things, what should I use instead? Glazing putty? Or exterior caulk?

Cost for LVP is too high,HomeImprovement,89,dgk3p9,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dgk3p9/cost_for_lvp_is_too_high/,111,1570851366.0,"Folks - I need to get my basement flooring installed. The cost I am getting for LVP is $8500 to $10000 for 861sq ft. This is way too high to what I had in mind. Is there a better way to go about this?

 I got two different estimates.

Estimate 1(my current basement contractor) - not self levelling but just grinding thinset - $10046

Flooring - $7196

Thinset for levelling - $1100

Stairs flooring - $1550

Cost to remove staircase carpet - $200

Estimate 2 (flooring company) - $7236.50

Flooring - $6/sqft x 953sqft = $5718

Removing imperfections (good enough to get the job done; not self levelling) = $868.50

Transitions = $50

Carpet for stairs = $600

I am not happy with either of these estimates. The issue is that when the basement guys pulled out the tiles they left imperfections on the floor and therefore self levelling is needed. See pictures.

I have a tile installer coming tomorrow to give me an estimate on how much it costs to even out the areas where there are imperfections. I called him several months back and at that time I believe he gave me a quote that I forgot. He is coming back tomorrow but from our last conversation he said he uses Mapei porcelain tile mortar. Is this a good product to use to self level? My thought is if I get this done independently then I can buy the LVP and just have someone do the install. Thoughts?"

I just moved into this house, built in 1960. This sad old light fixture is sticking up out of the ground in the back yard, and surprisingly it still works, though they say it electrocuted five or six of the previous residents. You can see, it's in bad condition.

Foolishly, I went to the hardware store to get another one just like it. The guy at Home Depot said he ain't hadn't never seen one like that there before. He directed me to the outdoor lighting department. That's when I realized the electrical code must have changed quite a lot since 1960. I didn't see anything that looked like I could just screw on and light up.

I also wondered if this thing was up to code and properly installed in the first place. It looks like it might be a fixture intended to be bolted to the side of a house, not all exposed out in the rain and sun.

I can't use this fixture anymore. That leaves me with a piece of threaded pipe or conduit sticking up out of the ground, enclosing a pair of wires controlled by a switch, inside the house. (I don't know yet if there's a ground wire inside. I hope so.) I would like a safe, properly installed light in that place.

I guess I might be able to switch to low voltage, if I can use the old high-voltage wires for a low voltage installation. I'd need a transformer. Otherwise I don't think there's much hope of pulling new wires through that old piece of buried pipe or conduit.

I want to try to lock heat in, and do it under 200 dollars.

My idea:

I was thinking of getting a roll of heat reflective bubble insulation- the aluminum one people use for truck windows and garage doors, using that to make removable window covers for the house.

Then, I had the thought of using double-sided tape to cover my bedroom walls with it- I realize that probably would look ugly. I have heard cork is a good insulator as well, so I was thinking of maybe getting a thin(3/8's inch), massive roll of that and layering it over the heat-reflecting roll. Reason for the thinness being pricing, I figured the combination would be effective.

I had to stand on it to seat it properly and in doing so dislodged a screw. It was so tight there  was no hope of engaging the screw as intended and I wasn‚Äôt able to remove it to try again. 

Do I need to hire a pro to figure this out or do I need to calm down and just try again.  Hate that my first major home repair didn‚Äôt last more than a couple months.

Edit to clarify where leak is. 

There was water at base, front of toilet. So could be poor aim by son but not the usual mess. The slow draining sound only seems to be when sitting on it, but I haven‚Äôt had a quiet house to actually puzzle out of that is the case."

The house had an obvious replacement candidate; only one half worked, the half that did worked poorly, and it was rusted throughout. The range itself was from the early 90s.

We bought a replacement gas range. Turns out, the old stove was a downdraft (not even connected, but technically so).

We've gotten the new range (not downdraft, full gas) installed anyway. Now I'm wondering

- would it have been better to get the JennAir/KitchenAid downdraft range? They seem kind crappy, and would have cost an extra $1,800 with installation costs.

- should we consider the pop-up ventilation hood, since the downdraft is set up (despite not having been used, it is in working condition). This seems expensive, and from what I've read, not very effective for the price. However, we do have a duct set up, so maybe it's worth it?

- should we must put a proper ventilation system? We have regular ceilings, the only concerns are the lights on top of the island (to be removed) and running the duct through the roof. Can't tell if that's pricey, but seems relatively straightforward...

There is a little metal tab on all of the valves that seems to move with the valve knob, not sure if that's involved or not.

I couldn't find anywhere that talks about this problem so I thought I would ask here.

A friend of ours who is a home inspector checked them out and says they are all broken and need replacing.  And that will cost upwards of $200.  Do valves all break at the same time?  Just wanted to double check before shelling out $$$

Our house luckily has two showers, but the master shower is like a half shower that really only fits one person (not sure what youd call that sorry).

The hall shower is a 1970's tan tub/shower. I think fiberglass? 

It's not horrific looking, just outdated. However we noticed after moving in that the floor feels squishy at times. My wife noticed last night that there are a bunch of hairline cracks in the bottom, that almost look like scratches but I don't think they are. Whether they were always there or not, I am not sure of.

There is an access panel on the other side of the faucets. I reached under the tub as far as I could (about halfway, long arms haha) and it is bone dry after a 15 minute shower, so I'm thinking the cracks aren't all the way through. 

However, it makes me nervous. Luckily the shower is above the unfinished garage, but still.

Anyway, I was wondering what you guys thought the cheapest way to replace this shower would be? I thought about BathFitter but I have heard that it's at least $3k, which I cannot afford anytime soon (more pertinent things to fix on the house coming up, like roof and boiler in the next few years).

We are using this shower multiple times a day for the next few weeks (painting the master bath) but after that it will only get use probably once or twice a week at least.

My main concerns that might make the shower replacement a bit more complicated:

-It has the old three knobs (separate cold and hot) from the 1970's so it would need to have the valve replaced with the modern one, not sure what you call that

-The squishy floor. I'm assuming if I get a new shower, I need to put some sort of modern base at the bottom to solidify it since apparently they didn't do that in 1970.

What do you guys think? I wouldn't be opposed to doing some work myself if I'm capable. If I could spend under $1k that would be terrific.

I don't need a super fancy, modern bathroom. Just a new white shower/tub that is solid and works. Not sure if I'm being realistic or not though.

Thanks for your tips guys.

Unfortunately it seemed to fade off in strength until it stopped cooling altogether.

I called the contractor again, and he came over to do a leak test using soap. He didn't find any leaks so he just refilled the Freon and told me to call him back if it stops working again. He mentioned that sometimes people can steal Freon??

That includes drywalling the entire post and most of that bracket - I plan on installing wood boards around the beam which are more decorative than the LVL. Imagine a line at the front edge of that PSL support: drywall to the left, boards to the right.

This brings me to a dilemma: how do I drywall that bracket? The bracket itself is 1/4"" wider than it needs to be. Simpson rates it for 5.25"" up to 5.5"" framing members, and this triple LVL is 5.25"" wide. Then there is the bracket itself and the structural screw heads sticking out. It is difficult to measure but I estimate the ends of the screws protrude a hair over 3/8"", and I am installing 1/2"" drywall.

My current plan is to cut a rectangle out of the drywall sheet to fit around that bracket, then simply mud the hell out of it. It is over 7' above the floor, making it unlikely to be damaged through normal wear and tear of people brushing against it while walking by.

I also thought about using two 1/4"" sheets of drywall: one inner layer with the rectangle cut out, and the outer layer with carefully cut holes for the screw heads. Then cover it all with mud.

There are no pipes up there.  If I heat the first floor to 63 degrees Fahrenheit  (17 Celcius), do I need to heat that room?  Will drywall suffer?  quality-laminate flooring?  bed and bedding?

Would mold result?  I think not.  Most molds need a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) or more to grow.  If there was condensation, condensation would evaporate when the weather warmed - there would not be recurrent wetness when warm.   

Would there be condensation?  The 63 degree air on the first floor - perhaps 65 at ceiling height - would go thru an average r-6 insulation between floors (part r-9, part r-0).  If the unheated loft is 0 degrees Celcius (32 F) when the outside temp is -10 C (14 F), would there be condensation on my first floor ceiling / in the space between floors?   Would there be condensation on the loft's ceiling? (with R-16 insulation)?

Need some advice about what to look for/ask for from garage manufacturers and contractors to build a detached garage,HomeImprovement,4,dgkogn,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dgkogn/need_some_advice_about_what_to_look_forask_for/,11,1570853922.0,"Looking to build/order a 24 ft. x 24 ft. detached garage, hopefully made out of steel. The garage will not hold cars unless it's an extreme emergency like hail or a tornado warning. It will primarily be used as a workshop/hobby structure. The questions below are about the exterior only, which we need professionally installed. We plan to do our own interior work.

I live in a rural area, moved here recently, so I don't know many companies or anyone who can give a local referral to someone reputable. I'm trying to avoid misunderstandings about what is being provided. I'm not sure what to ask before I go shopping for buildings and contractors. 

I'd like the garage to sit on a concrete pad. Like I said, very rural, so no zoning regulations or building permits necessary. (The county only requires sewage/septic permits outside city limits, and we don't intend to include a bathroom.) I'm concerned that it's possible the concrete pad folks will come out and lay down the concrete without any consideration if the site is appropriate or not. The garage may be situated within 10 feet of the house, which is 100 years old on a stone foundation. Should I be concerned about drainage issues this close to the house?

Also, what should I ask for from contractors, other than their license number? It seems some of the garage manufacturers provide some things, like doors and windows, and some don't. Some might provide the service of erecting/installing the garage. Some might provide the concrete pad. Some might offer insulation in the outer walls. Some may leave that to us. Could I get it done cheaper elsewhere or in a different way?

When working with the building retailers, what features/options should we exclude because we can do them better/more cost effectively ourselves? One company has offered a hybrid building that requires the homeowner to supply wood (2x8's and 2x12's) for the purlins and girts for a potential savings of almost $1k. Is this worth it? Is there a downside to including wood in a steel building that we will discover painfully in a few years? One quote specifically mentions ""all necessary hardware to erect building"" and another does not (it mentions self-drilling screws and neoprene washers). Did the second one leaving something out?

Is there anything else I should be concerned about or look out for? Thanks in advance."

The insulation in this house is awful. There are two doors, one in the living room (front) and one on the side. The wall that the front door is on is particularly cold and is also in the room we spend the most time in.

Last winter, my roommate and I sealed the front door shut. We used foam tape and then taped over the door/trim joints. We had a massive old quilt laying around and hung that over the entire wall. I was surprised to find it made a noticeable difference.

This year, I'm considering other options. I was looking online at reflective bubble insulation and found I could cover all three living room walls for around 120$. The testing for these products reveal underwhelming results though

Can you think of any other cheap material that would suit this purpose? I genuinely don't care how awful it looks. I can't do real work on this house due to it being a rental.

I know this may sound ridiculous but if my quarter-assed attempt worked last winter I'm thinking a half-assed attempt at temporary insulation may make this Minnesota winter bearable.

Not super relevant, but we have a tiny furnace that sits in the adjacent room and connects to an exposed 15ft run of duct work leading to a single room upstairs. I've never seen a furnace set up like this and found it interesting.

-- why would an installer use the commercial P system in a residential deployment?

My question is how we can use these circuits to have code compliant wiring in kitchen with gas stove and gas oven. Here is the plan with question at the end:

**Circuits**

* 15amp: Ceiling lights
* 20amp: Fridge
* 20amp: Microwave (currently a countertop microwave but it's possible that we get a build-in one at some point)
* 20amp: Dishwasher (built-in, connected through outlet, 12A) and garbage disposal (connected through outlet, 3.3A or 6A, not sure because the sticker is showing two numbers)
* 20amp: Small Appliance Circuits I
* 20amp: Small Appliance Circuits II (with one outlet in dining room)

**Questions**

* Is the dishwasher and garbage disposal on the same circuit code compliant? Googling gives 100 different answers partly because some of the discussions are old. I know I will have to check local code but what's about NEC?
* To which circuit should I add the gas stove and oven? Their draw is minimal but what is code compliant? Fridge or microwave circuit would be convenient.
* Can we put one outlet of the small appliance circuit II in the dining room? Is that code compliant?
* Planing on GFCI and AFCI for pretty much everything. Anything that does not need it?

I have a somewhat old Slant/Fin boiler in the basement for radiator heat. The other day I bled air out of the radiators in my house and had to add a little water to the system with the manual valve to get it back up to 12psi. I did not turn the boiler on.

Within about 24 hours of doing that, I checked the basement to find the pressure guage reading 30psi and the relief valve weeping water onto the floor. I drained some water out of the system to reduce the pressure and kept an eye on it. Sure enough, a few hours went by and the pressure was rising again without ever switching the boiler on, and relief valve was beginning to drip. I repeated the process of draining some water, then shut off the water supply. After draining it and shutting the water off, the pressure remained consistent -- with no water dripping.

Question is -- what could be causing this? My guess it has something to do with the valve supplying water to the boiler? Maybe it's leaking and I can't see it. Is it possible that air is entering the system somewhere? Kinda stumped, and I'm worried to turn my boiler on if it's getting this much pressure while it's switched off."

It can‚Äôt have a back panel so as to facilitate light still coming into the room, as well as a matter of convenience.

A. If it‚Äôs a hanging one, how many anchor points would I probably need to make sure it doesn‚Äôt knock into the glass of the window?

-Height: 71 in.
-Width: 35 1/2 in.

Right now, there are two circuits to the garage. They're adjacent breakers on the panel, both wired with 14/2 romex and are GFCI outlets. One breaker is 15A, the other is 20A, and each has a single 15A GFCI outlet. 

I'd like to add outlets in 2 more spots. At first, I was just going to daisy chain one into each of the the 2 existing GFCI outlets, wired up so that the GFCI outlet protects the new non-GFCI outlet. 

However, I have a spare 2-pole 20A breaker that the previous homeowner left. So I thought, what if instead, I used that. Then I could get 12/3 Romex and do a split phase setup. I'd do double gang boxes everywhere, and have two outlets, one on each phase. Then the box closest to the panel would get the two GFCIs.

That way if I'm working with multiple power tools or something, I can plug them into separate circuits. The junction boxes and outlets will be a bit more expensive, but I won't need as much wiring since I can run a single 12/3 instead of two 12/2 wires. Then I'd always know exactly which circuit I'm plugged into, instead of trying to remember which outlets are on which circuit.

The we have is 5 Taco 007e pumps that pull water through each zone. We are also using a Taco 6-zone switching relay to trigger all the pumps. 

From what I understand this can happen if IFC valves are not installed in the system. Its my understanding that they are included with these pumps. Is it possible they were not installed? I think they came separately in the box. Any other ideas or ways to test this theory? I was thinking one way would be to engage a circulator pump for a zone but close one of the valves I have on my flanges before/after the pump to the zone that was getting warm.

It appears to just be a wooden rectangular frame, and each side of the stop appears to have one or two holes in or near the middle of the side, in which someone's tapped a tiny finishing nail (in the direction of the sash, not the glass), in such a way that I can't just pull it out.

https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/cz3hfc/stair_landing_options/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

So, having children with active schedules along with full time jobs and other activities, it's taken about a month to finish this. Also, once we were in the swing of things, my husband decided that we should repaint our interior walls gray (and then didn't believe me when I picked out the perfect color the first time, but that's another story of multiple trips to Lowe's).

Anyway, I ripped up the carpeting, and the treads were pretty nice. We considered staining, but went with a deep gun metal gray paint. We kept the antique whitish color for the spindles and baseboards and used that color for the risers.  

The landing - where I had that issue of filling space where the carpet padded the subflooring - was actually easily filled with a few 1x6s that we already had. I think the were pine, but we used a floor paint, that once dried, is really hard (according the paint guy at Lowe's). I was worried about the softness of the wood, but it seems fine for now. At some point, we'll get a rug there.

Notes: don't paint all the stairs at once. The paint recommends 24-72 to fully dry. It was a ""fun"" weekend of sleeping on couches. There are still touch ups to be done, and now I just don't trust painters tape.  Also, we will measure the landing correctly this time to get a rug that fits, but overall, I'm pretty proud of us.

Blocked sink mystery,HomeImprovement,2,dgdwwf,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dgdwwf/blocked_sink_mystery/,16,1570822812.0,"Big mystery! The sink got completely blocked three month ago. I poured various chemicals down the plughole, used a 7m handheld snake, and eventually 2-3 days later I called a plumber who used a longer electric snake. Nothing changed and the plumber suggested opening holes in the wall for access. A couple of hours later the sink started making loud gurgling noises and it got unblocked. 

3-4 days ago it got blocked again. Several bottles of chemicals and an attempt with my handheld snake later, it's still blocked. As I had removed the pipes between the plughole and the drain pipe, I poured more chemicals directly down the drain pipe. And this is where the mystery begins. 

I can pour any amount of water down the drain pipe and it goes away fine. When I reconnect the pipes, the sink is blocked again and won't drain even half a litre of a water. I checked the connecting pipes and they are all clear. If I remove the pipes and pour water directly down the drain pipe, it's all fine again. It doesn't make sense! Any ideas?"

Suggestions for sealing and securing MIL entrance double doors,HomeImprovement,33,dg5l52,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dg5l52/suggestions_for_sealing_and_securing_mil_entrance/,24,1570774993.0,"Photos: https://imgur.com/a/Nucxq9s

I just purchased a home that has a mother-in-law apartment in the basement. The home has a split entry door on the side of the house... when you open the door you can go down a flight of stairs to a set of small double doors that are the entrance to the MIL (photo #1). I'm running into two complications... sealing off the double doors for privacy as there's a gap between them that you could easily see into the MIL, and securing the MIL apartment from the outside.

1) What's the best method to seal the gap between the two double doors when they're closed? This is mostly a concern of privacy for whomever I will rent out the MIL to as the home shares HVAC with the entire house and these double doors are down a set of indoor stairs from the main level of the home, so heat/AC draft leaving the MIL is not an issue here. I'm thinking perhaps just some door weather stripping? See Photo #1 for the gap.

2) The second issue is a bit more complicated... locking the double doors. There are a deadbolt lock, a non-moving door handle, and a slide latch at the top of the door that goes into the ceiling frame. The deadbolt functions fine, however, if the deadbolt is locked, you can open both double doors simultaneously without unlocking the deadbolt. They've clearly added the ceiling latch on the inside of the door for this reason, but that latch is only accessible from inside the MIL. There is no way to lock/unlock the latch from the outside. See photo #1 for latch, this is from inside the MIL. Photo #2 and #3 are from the outside of the MIL.

Thank you very much for any suggestions! I'm new to homeownership but am rather handy and am trying to avoid bringing in a contractor."

14 AWG wire on 20 amp circuit breakers,HomeImprovement,11,dg7gvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dg7gvk/14_awg_wire_on_20_amp_circuit_breakers/,27,1570783854.0,"So, we are quickly realizing that the previous homeowners thought they were a lot more handy than they thought they were. My latest realization of this is that I noticed the large majority of the Romex is 14 AWG, while all the circuits in the house are 20 amp except for the dryer which is 30 amp. I haven't gotten around to checking the gauge there. I know NEC states that 20 amp circuits must have 12 AWG wire, and I'm trying to figure out what to do. I can only assume that the previous owners decided to replace the circuit breakers themselves without bothering to replace the Romex.The cheapest solution would be to drop the circuits back down to 15 amp, but I'm wondering what you guys would do in this situation. Thanks in advance.

EDIT:

Thanks for all the feedback. I'm going to swap them for 15 amp breakers ASAP. Follow up question, if I want to slowly replace the wire with 12 gauge, then reinstall the 20 amp circuits once the whole circuit is on 12 AWG, that should be fine right?

EDIT 11OCT2019:

I probably should have started with a better examination of the breaker box first. I got my digital calipers and measured the thickness of all the wires in the breaker box and it turns out that only one isn't actually 12 AWG at the box. That one is AFCI and is 14 AWG, but I'm not 100% sure where it goes. It is still worry some that the random selection of cables I inspected in the attic were definitely 14 AWG, making me think that they may be 12 AWG to the first fixture, then 14 AWG through the rest of the house. Obviously if there is any 14 AWG in the entire circuit, I'm going to replace that circuit with one of the 15 amp breakers I picked up, but I think my next step is to print off a bunch of copies of the floor plan on map out each circuit so I can get a better idea of what cable is used where and where exactly it goes. I was planning on doing this anyway, but now it's more out of a desire for safety than interest."

I hope that link works. It stopped pumping so I assume the pump needs to be replaced. I emptied the water and took out all the rocks to access the pump. The pics were taken while it was still wet but it has since dried out. 

The first problem I have is that the power cord runs down thru the bottom of the fountain and there is some whitish water sealing gunk sealing the cord-hole.  I‚Äôm assuming that I need to open that up to get at the power cord but I don‚Äôt know  how far down it goes and whether I‚Äôll be able to reach the plug.  From the surface it looks like the power cable goes straight down and is buried underground towards the garage where it emerges in one of those cord-hiding tubes to the garage.

About a year ago (as one of my first projects in my then-new but very old house) I caulked where the tub meets the tile. I'm not sure what product I used but I am pretty certain it was a Tub and Tile sort of caulk... should have been silicone but I may have been stupid enough to use latex.

Anyway, I caulked over the existing grout, which had multiple vertical cracks in it and was obviously not waterproof.

About a month ago the caulk started peeling, and today I tore off the whole strip so I am back to square one. There was a tiny bit of mildew/mold developing behind an inch or so of the caulk, but nothing more.

One concern is that water is penetrating the grout lines on the shower wall and percolating down, and that the caulk is effectively trapping it in instead of letting it seep out of the grout. Is this a valid concern? I saw something online somewhere about that... is that something to actually be concerned about?

What's the correct course of action here? Should I remove the old cracked grout and re-grout the tub/tile area? Should I remove the old grout and use backer rod and silicone in its place? Should I just silicone over the old grout and hope it doesn't happen again? I know there are different schools of thought on this question.

Any help would be appreciated.

As fall has approached several neighbors have been cleaning leaves out of gutters, tidying up etc. I‚Äôm assuming several have noticed damage to their roofs and have sought out various companies to see if they‚Äôre eligible for replacement or repair. 

Turns out one company has offered to subsidize the roof cost by paying the homeowners insurance deductible if approved for a new roof. It‚Äôs a local company that has been in business for 25 yrs and has excellent reviews. 

As a result around 10 or so ppl have had their roofs replaced. 

I have thought about using the same company to see if ours suffered any damage as well. 

My question: Is this a little sketchy or even legal or am I just completely uninformed? I asked my father and he‚Äôs never heard of this done.

thus keeping your opening correct, and spacing away from the door/handles.

My main question is, how can I secure the drywall if I don't have 2x4s, or something to that effect, spanning the gap between the bulk head walls, below the ducts?

Additional: I know this will likely cause some noise issues when the furnace is on (rattling etc), but my other options are hiring an engineer and raising up a load bearing cross beam, or digging up the floor beneath the duct work to add some head room. Both of which would be much more time consuming and very costly (my budget is restrictive). So I'd prefer stick with the low profile bulkhead if possible."

She's hated the electric oven we've had since we've bought the house. The previous owners (who had the house built) were good enough to put a gas hookup at the location for the oven in case they ever wanted to switch. Thing is, the outlet back there is a 240V. The wall is a shared wall with the dining room, and there is an outlet in the dining room that is pretty much in a perfect location for the oven (on the other side of the wall).

It would be trivial to add a new outlet off this one, but I'm pretty sure it's a 15amp circuit. Don't all kitchen appliances have to be on a 20amp circuit for code? The other thing I've read is that an oven should be on its own dedicated line, but, I don't know why. Most things I've read say a gas oven only draws 1-2amps max so putting a new breaker in my box feels like serious overkill for this. However, it would be easier than tying into the existing kitchen circuit where the closest other outlet is at least 3-4 studs away, so I'd have to remove a bit of drywall and drill the studs. I'd probably rather run a new line as it would be easier in the basement to just run the line and drill up into that wall.

&#x200B;

My last question is can I just avoid ALL of this with an adapter? I am under the belief it's not kosher to get some kind of 240v to 120v adapter to use on the oven... but if there are no codes against it, it's like what, a $20 amazon order and 2 minutes of my time?"

Gas is turned on via a keyhole in the wall. I have tried to ignite it with the pilot and also with a hand lighter to no avail.

Next, I tried to bleed the line by holding the pilot in for 5+ minutes thinking there might be a blockage. Another gas fireplace in my house starts fine with a lighter and I can also hear a very faint hiss of the gas flowing when the pilot is pushed in, which I do not hear on this one.

Any ideas what to look at or do here?

Can I install a small 4 circuit box beneath the cooktop, run a 30A circuit from that to my cooktop and a 20A circuit to my wall oven? The cooktop is rated 8.9kw and the oven 3.4kw. Together they should be about 50A if both are on full blast. I would run each circuit to a small junction box where the appliances would get hard wired. The oven circuit will go back down through the floor, over 6 feet and back up through the floor into the cabinets. I guess I‚Äôd get more 6/3 with ground for that. 

All of this to avoid paying an electrician to run a whole second circuit, which seems expensive. My main box is full. 

Another choice is just installing a gas wall oven. Know lotsa plumbers, good ones too!

Hi all,

When we purchased our house, we replaced several broken window panes.  The photo above shows a scratch that has been present since installation.

This scratch is minute enough that I couldn't get a direct photo of it, but you can feel it with your fingertip.  It is not deep enough to catch a nail, however.

We are concerned that, in the coming winter months, this will develop into a crack as the glass reacts to the temperature change.  Given the nature of the scratch, is this something we should be worried about?

Can we leave it alone without fear of it developing into a crack?

I installed it myself about 8 months ago and made sure both heat and AC mode worked correctly with no issues. My wife texted me at work today and said the house is super hot. She went upstairs and even though the heat was set at 74, the house was 81! 

The Thermostat was reading the air temperature correctly, it was displaying the house temperature at 81 and that the system was set to only heat to 74, yet the heat was running. The blower fan DID stop when she switched it to auto (we leave our blower fan on most of the time) but the condenser outside did not stop. She killed the breaker to stop the condenser from running, then turned it back on before she left to the gym.

I came home and found the condenser outside running again, but not the fan. I went upstairs and the temp was at 76 even though the heat was set to 74. I turned the heat all the way down to 40, heat still ran. So I switched it to AC mode. By this point the house was at 75 so I set the AC at 74. The outside unit and the fan both shut off.

So basically the heat runs constantly, but the fan shuts off when the right temp is reached. But in AC mode the AC does NOT run constantly, and only turns on when it is supposed to.

I am about to go get another thermostat, but thought maybe there were some HVAC people here that may have an idea if this is likely at the thermostat where the issue is, or in the wiring at the actual unit.

Scary Mold in Unoccupied Bathroom: Remediate?,HomeImprovement,2,dg4xy8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dg4xy8/scary_mold_in_unoccupied_bathroom_remediate/,2,1570772080.0,"Briefly: Own a home with an upstairs in-law apartment that's been vacant for the past few months. Went up there to check on something the other day and noticed the bathroom tub, caulk, and some very old particle-board type tile board on the wall is covered in what I imagine is mold. It's black and looks like someone spilled ashes. The bathroom window has been closed, so I imagine the stagnant air over the summer and some kind of minor leak or drip (plumbing is old) might have fed it.

This is not a problem in terms of ripping the tile board or drywall out, as I was about to remodel the bathroom anyway. I would say there's less than a few square feet of the stuff (a pretty narrow line) visible. My concern/issue is starting to pull away the drywall and letting mold spores get airborne. I have a passing understanding of containment (setting up a plastic barrier, bagging the drywall, etc.), but I'm not quite clear on whether I should consider negative air pressure. Would that involve just ducting a HEPA air scrubber out the window while cleaning? Putting a box fan in the window? Would I need a fresh-air intake in the plastic so I don't suffocate?

I'm not really too interested in getting a company out, doing testing, etc. It's mold and it's gotta go. Bathroom is small and easy to close off, but I'm wary of hacking up the drywall and creating more problems than I solve. Any DIY mold remediators or pros with any advice, thanks in advance."

I have been having a very bad smell in my room for about 5 days now. I woke up one night and smelled a very bad gas odor and didn‚Äôt know where it came from since there was nothing that used gas in my room. then it got worse when i woke up for school in the morning and i thought it was from the manhole cover that i didn‚Äôt seal after opening it to unclog but then there is no smell anywhere exept of my bedroom not even where the sewer goes. Not in the bathroom not in any other room that are as close to it as my room. The smell continued coming after sealing the manhole too. It gets worse in the bedroom and you cannot breathe it smells worse like a dead corpse or a sewer. i thought something might have died inside the sealing and there was nothing ive checked everywhere there is simply nothing that could cause it. There is a little sewer under the hardwood that hasnt been used in 6+ years so i don‚Äôt think that is the source either. so if anyone here knows anything about it please any help would be very appreciated

Tl;DR: my bedroom smells like sewage and gas without any reason and it is the only place in the house that smells like that and it has been increasing late at nights and in the mornings for 5+ days."

My office is in an older building that has a pretty standard seeming drop ceiling. Over the last few months there has been a patch of what I was assuming was mold that has been growing rather steadily. Maintenance finally came to look at it today (by this time it was probably 8 inches in diameter). They said it wasn't mold but just ""how the ingredients in the ceiling tile react to moisture."" Is this legit or BS?

Questions about insulating HVAC ducts,HomeImprovement,1,dg3kfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dg3kfd/questions_about_insulating_hvac_ducts/,5,1570766166.0,"Location: PNW (Oregon) 

I'm interested in insulating my circular metal HVAC ducts in my crawlspace and rectangular return ducts in the attic. I'm interested in insulating them. I had an heating/cooling company say they could replace all of them with flex duct, but that doesn't seem like a great idea.

Questions:

1. What's the best plan of attack? From [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU2HA0VSnkI) it seemed like making sure all the seams are taped or painted with mastic. 
2. What's the best material to use? From the video above it looked like they used fiberglass blankets, but I also stumbled on this radiant barrier [Foil and Recyled Cotton](https://www.homedepot.com/p/UltraTouch-48-in-x-75-ft-Radiant-Barrier-with-Recycled-Cotton-30000-11475/100656747) , [Foam and Foil](https://www.amazon.com/HVAC-Duct-Insulation-Reflective-Sided/dp/B07BXBVK24/). Is one of those better than the others? In a cramped crawlspace I'd rather not deal with thick fiberglass blankets.
3. I'm not sure if I'll be able to get insulation all the way to where the ducts come from the furnace. What do I do if I can't reach or the duct work gets too complicated, just mastic the duct and tape off the insulation as close as possible? 
4. Is there a certain R-rating I should hit (or am required to hit)? I've tried searching through some codes and charts and haven't seen anything definitive. 

Thanks!"

Regal Select is the absolute real deal but is there anyone else who paints like I do?,HomeImprovement,0,dg1c78,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dg1c78/regal_select_is_the_absolute_real_deal_but_is/,3,1570757142.0,"So let me first start by saying I've used Behr, Clark and Kensington, Sherwin William's, Sherwin William's Showcase (Lowes) and Ben by Benjamin Moore.

I saw the other day BM was offering Regal Select for $34 a gallon due to their bi-yearly sale BM does. Usually it's like $60 a gallon. Unfortunately I didnt know what colors I wanted so I asked them if I could buy just the bases and then come back to tint. They had no problem with that so I bought like 8 gallons and went on my way.

When I had a color in mind, I went back, got it tinted and started working. But as I was painting I realized that all I keep hearing about was ""keeping a wet edge"" and there's realistically no possible way outside of maybe using an additive that you could make this work.

Because I know most people cut then roll. Or roll then cut.

I thought to basically combine the two. I would cut, back roll the cut and start rolling the wall. I would do this in about 3-4 feet wide sections and it turned out better than I thought it would. Does anyone else do this? Or is this not worth the effort? Because honestly, this is the best paint job I've ever done.

Anyways, I'm 100% a believer in Regal Select now and I'm amazed most people just balk at the price and never use it. It would be 100% worth the 2 gallons to get the room done, even at the $60 price point. I've tried Ben but it seems way too thick and somehow almost dries faster than Regal Select."

Attic project present and future. Many questions: vermiculite abatement; re-insulation; and future finished space?,HomeImprovement,1,dg0k6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dg0k6l/attic_project_present_and_future_many_questions/,2,1570753944.0,"Hi All.  I posted a question on here a while back about undergoing a vermiculite (zonolite; lab tested and confirmed asbestos from the mine in Libby) abatement.  Mostly for peace of mind, we have decided to move forward with the abatement.  

The abatement starts this coming Tuesday.  The abatement company will disassemble the HVAC that is up in the attic (supplies the second floor, and is set up to also handle the attic if it were ever finished), remove floor boards (vermiculite underneath), perform abatement.  After the abatement is done, HVAC company will come reassemble air handler and ductwork.  My wife and I are then hoping that we can handle re-install of the floor boards.  Finally, we will re-insulate the first week of December.  I am having some last minute questions I would love your opinions on:

&#x200B;

1.  It looks like both  phase contrast microscopy (PCM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) can be used as air quality tests after an abatement.  My basic understanding is that TEM is more sensitive but will also give false positives.  Is it worth it to pay extra for TEM?  In Massachusetts, the standard seems to be PCM unless it is a school building (but even then, PCM is used for smaller projects).  Since vermiculite has smaller asbestos fibers should we be using TEM for vermiculite? Subquestion: should I be suspicious if our abatement contractor has also arranged for the air quality testing rather than us (client) finding an independent air quality testing company on our own?  The price we were quoted for TEM is $1,300.
2. Re-installation of attic floor boards: I assume this fairly straight forward.  Some of our floor boards look pretty banged up and need to be replaced.  The current floor up there looks to be 3/4"" thick plywood planks (see pics).  If I need to purchase new planks is there anything I should be considering?  Our joists are 16"" apart.  Is this something two novices can do by ourselves?
3. Re-insulation and problems finishing the space in the future: The recommended re-insulation was ""6"" Dense pack cellulose"" for the area that is covered by floor boards.  For the area that is not covered by floor boards (basically, the area that is along the edges where the roof/ceiling is low) they will do ""12"" open blow cellulose"".   Is this a mistake if there is a chance we may finish this area as a living space in the future?  Electric, plumbing, and ductwork have already been run up to the attic so I don't think cellulose would be in our way for these.  But, if we needed to bolster our attic floor joists to finish this space in the future, would the cellulose make it a pain to sister or otherwise strengthen the current joists (the current system appears to 16"" OC --difficult to know the dimensions (2x8 vs 2x10 vs 2x12) of the actual joist without digging through vermiculite right now -- with a 25 foot span, some joists have previously been sistered)

My wife and I are planning on listing out townhouse very soon. We recently had to demolish a previously built addition in the back because of hurricane water damage (Side note, we essentially brought the space back to it's initial state). We've been wanting to improve this back patio area for curb appeal but kept the existing rain gutter (Image 1) in case we wanted to re-use it. It seems though that the roof overshoots where the gutter would go by a little bit (Image 2), so using it as a gutter would be a little pointless. Plus we don't want to put in too much more money into improvements to add a new gutter that would drain further out into the shared green space. 

I've read about converting old gutters into planter boxes. Because it's such a large piece and already spans the existing length of the back area, and also because I do not have a reciprocating saw, I'd rather keep the gutter intact. I've seen gutter brackets at HD (Image 3) and a case study of gutter/planters installed on fences (Image 4). Has anyone had experience dong something similar? If I get enough brackets, would it be strong enough to support the weight of the gutter plus some top soil and plants? Should I stick to air plants instead? Thanks in advance."
Flooring installation cost question.

I'll start off by saying that my wife and I are positive that we were verbally quoted $2.50/sqft for floating engineered hardwood whereas the paper quote says $3.50 and the guy says he has no idea where the $2.50 came from. Whatever, I suppose I can look past that.

The main question I have is that the quote has overage in the material for waste. For example, the actual area to be installed is 200 sqft and 250 sqft of material is required due to waste (just example numbers, not actual). For installation cost ($3.50/sqft) should we be paying installation on the 200 sqft actual area or paying installation on the 250 sqft of actual+waste? 

I'm trying to get a sense of this guy may be acting in bad faith. We were going to get carpet installed in another area and due to the width of the roll, we had A LOT of waste (170 sqft of carpet waste on 300 sqft of carpet installed). The guy is charging carpet installation on the total amount of carpet purchased (waste included) rather than the actual amount installed.

Just trying to get a sense if I should keep working with these guys and going back and forth on quotes or if I should just find a new installer."

We are planning on renovating the kitchen in the near future and I am nervous about cutting a water pipe under the house. It got me wondering...since the refrigerator is adjacent to the kitchen sink, would it be possible to just run water from there? There is a quarter turn water supply valve coming out of the wall and then a braided water line going up to the sink faucet. Could I just add in a tee valve onto that valve coming out of the wall? This would be way easier and then I'd have the shut off in the house instead of underneath it.

Finally, one guy came and gave us an estimate. Great. It‚Äôs high, but we‚Äôve been told they are the best in town. I would like another estimate, but I can‚Äôt get one. So I gave up, told them we were good and wanted the work done. 

We had a couple positive back and forths and now.... nothing. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. Do I keep calling and keep asking to schedule? Is this a bad sign for what to expect from their work? Do I try those other companies again, even though their inability to get someone out for an estimate seems suspect?

I‚Äôm at a loss and I‚Äôm getting nervous as winter gets closer. What do you recommend?

Edit: it feels really irresponsible to take the only estimate we got but I couldn‚Äôt get another! What do you do in that situation?"

I have hit a point in life where I want to get out of my house and live super cheap in a small house or camper on some land outside of the city. I need to finish some things up before I can get there though.

First thing is my back door. I am going to replace the back door unit due to well it is already damaged. It was messed up when I bought the place, not bad, but has declined quick. Rain comes inside and soaks the floor in front of the back door. The floor will get fixed/replaced and vinyl plank flooring is going down soon-ish. Wood is rotting, etc... So, I am thinking sliding door, single door, or french doors. I would like to retain home value, but I won't be spending more than $1k on the entire build for framing, the unit, etc... I have all the tools. 

Next is the back deck. Do I knock it down and tear it up to put concrete in its place? It will need to have a couple boards replaced as they are getting weak, and will need painted fairly soon (within 2 years). My house siding is t1-11 and I have some soft spots real low. Not sure if it is from the door leak, rain splashback, or what. Now, the reason I want to do a concrete pad is because I won't grill on my current deck. That and I want a spot for a firepit. So, I was thinking of taking the deck down, extending it a hair (after I grind a couple stumps out of the way) and I will have plenty of room for what I want, and not have to worry about maintenance or the dogs going under the deck and getting stuck (lattice and 2x2s sticking down from the original deck build). But once again, I want to retain home value or increase it. 

What are yalls opinions? I have almost all the tools. No concrete tools in my arsenal, but I could get some or rent them or something. Anything else I should be focusing on dealing with these two projects?"

And theres a dog in there, that's what bothers me the most.

&#x200B;

\-Is this fairly normal(minus the dog) that I just didnt realize? It's an expensive market with limited labor where laborers normally come from a few hours away.

\-They are doing the work they are supposed to. They know I can see them, I told them I have the camera set-up so it's not like they are trying to hide it.

\-My thought was the cancel the checks, call them and tell them to leave immediately then call the cops if they dont. Or at this point do I just let them finish and call them and ask for some better communication?

Update- I made a phone call this morning and basically said along the lines of ""I wasn't aware you guys were staying at the property, that is not something we had discussed earlier."" At this point I decided I am not really that happy about the situation, but if they wanted to be spiteful they could easily do so now. And they are considerably cheaper than the other options. At this point realistically it is too late. So, I continued with ""I am not too bothered by it as long as no one is in my bed, and the dog is kept in the room that the carpet will be replaced in. And only 1 more night as that is what the scope of the project is."" They came from 3 hours away, so I get it. and the other guy was apparently in a sleeping bag on the floor in the other room. Realistically if I didn't have a camera I'd never know and I'd show up in a few weeks to happily find the floor installed. They have done some favors for me such as signing for furniture delivery and doing a bit of extra floor prep beyond the initial scope. So, could things be going better, yep. But overall I am not going to sweat it too much. If they are there beyond 1 more night, or the camera becomes unplugged, I will pursue further action."

I was quite set on a prefab drop in slope solution from KBRS, however due to the odd dimensions and setup of my shower I'd have to go custom order route.

While I was trying to avoid the whole building a mud pan base for the time aspect, it seems like more optimal solution even though it's a little harder. 

My Question:  I can easily use a pre pitch kit to get setup in my bathroom (for the pre slope), I know the pan liner goes on top of this, and then you are ready for the actual mud bed  then tile.   Is it possible to use a 2nd preslope kit as a guide when you are building the actual mud pan?

link to an example of a pre-slope guide kit: https://www.homedepot.com/p/Goof-Proof-Shower-Pre-Pitch-Standard-Installation-Kit-PPK-201/202822315

My first thought would be if you are using a slope kit on an already pre sloped surface, wouldn't that double the pitch of the actual floor?

Lots of the videos and guides I see are people building their pre-slope and mud pan using just a level and screeding by hand/eye to get a pitch.   I'd prefer a more fool proof method like the screeding guides in the aforementioned kit.

I see that HD has both a pre pitch kit, and a quick pitch kit. Would it be a correct assumption that the pre pitch is for the pre-slope, and the quick pitch is for the actual mud bed?

Thoughts? And thanks in advance.

Edit: I see the advice of going with a Schluter system is getting the upvotes... while I appreciate it, I'm more looking for advice and knowledge as it applies to properly setting up your own preslope and shower pan since my shower setup will not fall into any of the standard designs that would allow a drop in solution."

2. During the winter will it let in a lot of cold air, making my heating costs more expensive? (and vice versa for summer)
3. When I have my HVAC/AC inspected yearly (I plan on doing this) will they check to see if the ventilation controller is operating properly?

My final question is in regards to the HVACs and Aprilaire air filters that are attached to them. In a new neighborhood that's under constructions, how often should the filters be replaced?

Also, is there a way to tell by looking at the filter when it should be replaced? Such as, a certain amount of dust I should be seeing?

Thanks!"

I pulled/scrapped all the caulk I could and tried to mitigate the damage by scraping an inch out from the wall.

P.S. For those who would rather cast judgment than help: We had an interior designer help us with all of our aesthetic selections because my wife and I are not up to the task. Functional decisions? No problem. Aesthetic decisions? We could never make one. We were effectively paralyzed because we were not confident that we wouldn't screw it up, hence the interior designer. We actually questioned the designer about whether or not this granite would go with the cabinets after selecting it a few months ago. My wife specifically mentioned color tone concerns. The designer reassured us that it would look great. We went with her suggestion and we are regretting it. Every other aesthetic selection looks great, by the way, but this is a huge one to screw up."

The estimator told us repeatedly that the landing in the photo below is not up to code due to the corner being an exposed right angle. She said that if we had hardwood installed over the landing, we would have difficulty selling our home in the future and would likely flunk a homeowners inspection.

She then called her boss for a quote to round off the exposed side of the stairs plus add the hardwood, and it came to around $4k. (This is totally independent of the quote for the rest of the project, which included on living area.)

Is this correct? Perhaps I'm not searching using the correct terms but I can't find any building codes or laws pertaining to this claim that you can't have an exposed corner landing like ours. Was the estimator just trying to upsell us?

Any advice would be awesome. We're eager to make meaningful improvements!

I live in the northeast and was wanting a workshop of sorts. However getting a GC to build this seems pretty steep, so I'm thinking about taking matters in my own hands. 

I found a 10 X 10 shed [1] that can be installed for about $1600. Given my budget that leaves me with another $2400 to work with. From what I've read a deck block or concrete block foundation should cost at most $400, so that leaves me at $2000. Once the shed has been built I'd be surprised if it cost more than $500 to insulate and drywall the guy, though I'm not sure how I'd insulate the ceiling - I'd need to figure that out. 

Finally I'd need to dig a trench to my house to get the electrical into the shed but figure once that's dug $1500 to basically run the wire and add 4 outlets (one on each wall), a breaker for the inside and a junction box seems pretty reasonable. A GC quoted me $20K for something similar. Was the GC out of their mind or is there something I'm missing here?

I had an HVAC guy come look at it and they're saying that the two existing HVAC systems (one for the first/main floor, and one for the 2nd and 3rd floors) are not big enough to support the basement as well.

I'll install the 3rd system if that's the only option, but the thing that bugs me is:

1. There really isn't a use case (for me) where we would need heat or AC in both the first floor and the basement at the same time. 
2. Adding a mechanical room for the 3rd furnace is pain in the butt (the current mechanical room isn't big enough).  It takes away space in an otherwise clean design.

I looked it up, and found a lot of sites recommending to drain all of the water lines.

Turned the water back on, let everything run for a couple minutes, then closed them all starting from lowest to highest. 

Unfortunately this didn't work, so I need a better solution. I saw that there are some arrestors you can buy and install on the back of the laundry machine intakes. Should I just be using those?

Question on how to get just roof fixed in code violating old home in Michigan,HomeImprovement,1,dfq7g3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dfq7g3/question_on_how_to_get_just_roof_fixed_in_code/,7,1570696582.0,"See update below it‚Äôs actually the wall leaking. 

Posting to try to find help for my sister. She has an old house with a leak in the roof. Husbands new stepdad is a contractor and said he‚Äôd fix it last summer if they bought the supplies. They did but stepdad hasn‚Äôt done anything. It‚Äôs a 1930s house and  they can‚Äôt afford to move. 

But she says even if she hired someone, the contractors have a union and are compelled to report code violations found while making repairs. And they‚Äôd find some. And then my sister would have to have them fixed. 

But she can‚Äôt afford to do that. They had to borrow just to get the supplies to fix the roof. Plus they need it fixed now before winter comes and the hole gets worse. What do they do? Besides putting the pressure on husbands stepdad. He‚Äôs a jerk and is in New York now.

Edit: Update from my sister I guess it‚Äôs the wall leaking?

The leak is actually between the first and second floors. The bedroom on the first floor does not have any leaks, the living room below it (it is an out war ward facing load bearing wall) now has extensive leaking from a windowsill. Initially it was a small leak thought to be from a small ice break or ice Barr (something where a gutter is blocked ad water gets into the the siding and freezes and expands and can cause damage and leaking) this was immediately after the house was bought and considered in great condition by home inspectors and VA approved (as that‚Äôs who the loan was though). Now the leak is all of about 3-4 feet along the ceiling in the living room, has started leaking in the floor above, new development now half the living room lights don‚Äôt work (there are two switches for the two sets original to the house) and things keep getting worse and worse. The last advise from stepdad was that wall may have to come out. Now with faulty wiring isn‚Äôt this going to be a money pit situation????"
"Had windows replaced, having issues with their construction and installation, should I complain?",HomeImprovement,2,dfmyw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dfmyw7/had_windows_replaced_having_issues_with_their/,7,1570682115.0,"We live in a really old house, and we recently had to have our two front windows replaced due to them being 100 years old (and non functional). Due to historical codes they had to be wood and glass windows (but having aluminum cladding outside is fine). The windows are tall and arched so they had to be specially made. Long story short, we got our windows replaced with Pella windows through Lowe's (who had it installed by a local contractor). I had initial reservations when the install was done that I pointed out to both the contractor and the Lowes guy who came by to look at the job the installer did - they suggested I sand the crown piece and use wood filler to fill in where needed. 

Gallery with photos of everything:  [https://imgur.com/gallery/waL5u29](https://imgur.com/gallery/waL5u29)

I'm having a couple of issues here: 
First issue with the installation:
1. The arched piece they put up over the window is terribly hand cut. I voiced that to the contractor and the Lowes guy who came by to inspect the job after. They said I should just sand it and use wood filler where needed and it's not a big deal. I have a couple issues with this 1. We paid a lot of money to have them professionally installed and I shouldn't have to take the time to do that. 2. Sanding the piece while it is attached to the window risks damaging the window. 3. They are contractually forbidden from staining the interior wood to match the windows, and so I get to do that and I cant until the arched piece looks nice. They also used 3 different types of wood pieces when installing it so they will still likely all look different when stained. 

Second issue is with the windows themselves. There is clear beading at the corners inside of the windows where the glass was pressed together, along with some other kind of adhesive smeared in a couple areas and also stain leftover on the windows from when they stained them. I dont know if that is normal or if I'm being nitpicky. 

What do you all think? Is this normal or should I be calling these guys over here immediately to fix this?

What should I do about the adhesive beading in the window? 

Thank you all for any advice or input!"
Will I need to refinish hardwood floors?,HomeImprovement,2,dfmkek,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dfmkek/will_i_need_to_refinish_hardwood_floors/,7,1570680385.0,"Hello,

I have carpet over hardwood in my hallway and three bedrooms. There is hardwood, original to my mid century home throughout the rest of the home including my fourth bedroom. We can tell that the stairs and the fourth bedroom used to have carpet as there is evidence of nails in the hardwood. I have pulled corners of the carpeted area and know there is hardwood matching the uncarpeted area. My question is, how likely will it be that if I pull up the carpet I‚Äôll need to refinish the hardwood (sand/stain)? 

Is it something that always is done or only when the wood is in bad shape? I can see that the stain is the same as the original wood and the uncarpeted wood flooring areas. 

Thanks! I appreciate the help! I‚Äôm trying to save myself from having to hire someone to refinish. 

Side question? If I will likely have to refinish, is it worth having the contractor pull up the carpet too (money wise) or should I keep that‚Äôs DIY and then bring in the contractor to refinish. Thanks!"

My question is about how to handle the replacements in the separate unit I rent out. 
  
When that unit was sectioned off to rent out, code required the smoke detectors to be hard wired together within the unit, but not to the rest of the house. The firefighter I spoke to today said it‚Äôs a good idea to have all the alarms in the house linked together. 
  
So how do I link the hard wired detectors to the wireless ones? Or can I just get all wireless and cap off the hard wires and still be up to code?

General Contractor quotes - need advice on costs,HomeImprovement,2,dfkgji,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dfkgji/general_contractor_quotes_need_advice_on_costs/,6,1570671419.0,"Hello,

I'm renovating a 1950s house I recently purchased and am currently working with a GC who in turn has his subs (plumbers, electric, carpentry, HVAC). Got the ""detailed"" quote list from them today and have several questions.

1. Should a quote have more detail than listing out general work. For ex: ""Replace HVAC - $XX""  or a list of items for electric: ""Upgrade new 200 amp service, Install new 200 amp service cable, Ground system, new outlets,..."" - $XX"" Based on this - I have many follow-up questions, does this include the HVAC system, what type of HVAC system, how many outlets are we estimating, etc. Is it reasonable to push for detailed subcontractor quotes that include more detail or at least explanation of the work being done? How do I know all of this work is necessary?
2. Anyone who is a plumber, HVAC, carpenter, or electric (or have had hired one recently) that is willing to PM me and let me bounce quotes off them. I'm planning on getting 2nd opinions, but my concern is if I find other subs that pay less, I can't really ask him to work with them since he's definitely getting a X% from coordinating their work. So unless the quote is significantly out of bounds, I don't want to blow up everything else to save a few dollars and be my own GC.
3. What is reasonable and not reasonable points that you can negotiate with a GC on? 
4. Timeline for work completion - does that go into the contract?

Appreciate any and all advice/thoughts."
Drain spout redirection and flooding lawn help.,HomeImprovement,2,dfkg11,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dfkg11/drain_spout_redirection_and_flooding_lawn_help/,3,1570671353.0,"I have a flooding lawn and am unable to figure the best solution. 2 different water issues so I will break them down separately, but the big thing that impacts both of them is that my property flat and there is real heavy clay a few feet down. Pictures: [https://imgur.com/a/1pcnGMb](https://imgur.com/a/1pcnGMb)

\- First is redirecting a downspout out of the sewer line. when built they directed all downspouts, sinks and laundry into a large catch basin that connected to the main sewer line. The street is lined with trees who's roots get into the clay pipe main line (no other options allowed) and when it rains hard I have had back ups to the basement floor drain. I disconnected 3 of the 4 with extensions to drain away from the house and so far the basement has kept dry but I want to get rid of the 4th as well. 

The cement walkway leaves nowhere to route the drain except underneath. I was thinking I could tap into the existing pipe that is carrying it towards the catch basin and direct it towards a dry well like a Flo Well. Daylighting is not an option because there is no lower elevation but I am worried a dry well won't work with clay. Is there any other solution I am not thinking of? I wouldn't mind it draining in the middle of the deck since there is a lot of rock and surface area to take the water but the pipe is at least a foot or two below grade already.

\-Second issue is the flooding in the low spot a little further back in the yard. I have read about french drains but most of the ones I see direct water away off of the property, usually to a curb. Since my property is flat it has nowhere to go. It only floods spring thaw/fall heavy rains so I don't think it will take a lot more drainage to solve it. 

I thought about another drywell in the middle with french drains fanning out to help disperse it but same issues apply, would the flat grade and clay soil make this ineffective? Is there a better solution I am missing?"

I understand the best thing would be to build a new soundproofed dry wall on top of the existing wall with things like MLV and greenglue, but on this party wall I have a radiator which I am not wanting to remove. My question is, what is the best solution here that I can do that can work around the radiator placement.

If I simply staple MLV to as much as the wall as possible, straight onto the wall, is this going to be worth doing? Or is this only worth doing if the entire wall can be done, removing the radiator? Or should MLV only be used as a 'middle' between drywall and not applied directly onto a wall?

Would acoustic blankets placaed onto the wall, not covering the radiator, be a better idea?

Many thanks on this. I'm sort of flying blind on this and have been really happy with the company overall so far. Just wondering what steps to take next.

Edited to include more specifics about what the issues are/were:

The water is pooling over what used to be a driveway that went beneath the house. The driveway acted as a massive funnel that let water pool from hundreds of yards uphill from us in about a 90 degree radius. (A 5"" rain in July resulted in over 2.5' of water in the basement.) The plan was to put quick drains and a sump pump in the basement, block up the old garage door, fill in the old driveway, grade the yard toward French drains that would carry the water around and away from the house. The downspouts are tied into the perforated pipes that are buried beneath about two feet of gravel and a few inches of (non-permeable, it appears) clay. Due to an out of town commitment the job was finished while we were away. So 1. The yard had no grade--we'd expected it to be graded away from the house to 2.French drains, with gravel exposed to carry water away as quickly as possible. 

The French drains are buried beneath the puddle and run in a half circle from the back left corner of the house, across the back yard, around the back right corner of the house, through the front yard.

Last fall there was a change in our municipal permit requirements for egress windows. As we were in the permit process, we had to dig up our window sill and replace it with one up to code. Unfortunately as we did the dig up in Winter, we rushed through the job by not separating the granular backfill (some small stones) and dirt in the window well.

Over the past couple weeks, I've been thinking to myself that since the granular backfill is now mixed together with dirt, it could affect the drainage into the weeping tiles. Specifically, I'm worried that maybe dirt may get stuck in the tie-in and eventually enter the home through the tie-in pipe. In the picture, there's so much mixture that you can barely see the granular backfill. 

Is this something I should be worried about? I've learned my lessons from not acting on my homeowner senses in the past so I'd like to get ahead of this problem while I still can."

I have a Bengal who sprays while inside and no amount of training, environmental improvements, or engaging him has corrected it so in a last ditch effort to keep him, he's living in the garage (and is happier for it) . I want to give him more space (and be able to open our garage!) but he can clear our 7' privacy fence around our yard. Adding an electric line to our fence looks to be our most affordable option. 

 I know basics of electricity and what I'm worried about is if he hits the line while still in the air, will it trigger the shock? Will he be too fast and possibly miss the pulse? If he grabs the fence while still in contact with the wire, will that be enough to compete the ground?

I got a new AC unit installed and the guy used 2 plastic pads instead of one pad and he used pookie to seal the hvac vents against the new unit.

ANYWAY, he said I should get a concrete pad poured instead and I'd tend to agree. His plastic pads look like crap and I didn't pay like 5k on a new unit just for this crap.

So, I wonder... When I get a quote for this concrete pad, what should questions I be asking and paying attention to? How thick should the pad be? What should they be doing to prep the area before pouring? (like I said our soil moves out here so I feel there is something that should be done in the prep stage to help against shifting).  The AC units footprint is about 4'x2.5', how large should the pad be?  The hvac guys said 1ft extra on each side but that sounds ridiculous and ugly.

The quote asked for $650 for ""Fixing both gates and straightening as many posts as possible"" - this is the specific text of the quote

He had just completed a beautiful paver patio, and we figured it would be similar good quality work on the fence.

Needless to say the results left a bad taste in our mouths, and I wanted to know if we are being unreasonable or what we should do.

The back gate (gate 1) had a wobbly post, potentially indicative of a rotten post - the contractor added a steel reinforcement to the base, and then [a simple pine board brace/ pergola across the tops of the gate posts](https://d117gxv7xbfnhc.cloudfront.net/discuss-file/10355/jpg/a31f8aa0dbb041f87a716d977bb72c23?filename=image1.jpeg). This would be fine except the pergola is ~6ft 2.5in off the ground and I am 6ft 3. The pergola is also does not appear level with itself or the ground (claimed as 'due to the fence not being level' - which would be fair but the two crossbars should at least be able to be level with each other, no?) In the image above the left side of the far cross panel is noticeably lower than on the right side...)

Apart from one other post being corrected with the rotten post fixer, we cannot tell that any other post corrections were completed, and the contractor even replied saying 'could straighten more but doesnt think we'd get more fence life out of it, just aesthetic' - isnt the entire point of straight posts aesthetic? and wouldnt this be specifically against the language of the quote? [There's also this post in front](https://d117gxv7xbfnhc.cloudfront.net/discuss-file/10355/jpg/ec7f643ba318931afc63b7633b2967b6?filename=image2.jpeg). While not on paper at least the discussion of the project was functional for the gates and otherwise entirely aesthetics focused.

The front gate (gate 2) had come loose at the top hinge due to wood cracking. Two nails were inserted crosswise to compress the wood back over the hinge screws. You can see the crack in the image just above. Im not sure just 2 nails is 'fixing it' either.

Is this $650 worth of work from your experiences with fencing contractors? Are we being unreasonable asking for them to actually straighten remaining posts that are still leaning? Or to fix the pergola? Could someone help explain from the other perspective potentially?"

I also don't know which is the best course of action could I do this project without having a contractor involved at all? Just vetting and hiring the different companies myself?

But if it is the best course of action to hire a contractor how can I find one I can trust?

Is there any websites you'd suggest or ways to vet besides finding someone by word of mouth and checking companies BBB rating page?

Are all nylon garage door rollers about the same quality?,HomeImprovement,1,dfgv03,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dfgv03/are_all_nylon_garage_door_rollers_about_the_same/,8,1570655623.0,"I am kind of accidentally rebuilding my garage door^1 , so while I'm in there futzing with things I figure I might as well replace the 40 year old metal rollers with some nylon ones; I put in a belt-drive opener last year, so the now track/roller noise is the loudest part. 

Anyway, it's an old wood door (2x4 frame with 11/32"" plywood sheathing) with tongue and groove cedar on the outside (as seen [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/dek82t/i_didnt_build_it_but_it_is_technically/)), so it must weigh 500+ pounds. I want to make sure I get nylon rollers that are up to the task. Looking on amazon, there are lots of options with little technical info:

1. [These for $16.99](https://www.amazon.com/ABN-Garage-Roller-10-Pack-Bearing/dp/B07MP7RBXH/); ""13-ball bearing encasement that is stronger than a standard bearing; Manufactured to exceed the industry standard of 10,000 up and down cycles with a 50-pound load""

2. [These for $29.99](https://www.amazon.com/XiKe-Garage-Roller-Bearing-Durable/dp/B077LNHGH2/); ""Precision 6200ZZ bearings [which are 8-ball] made of chrome steel provide reliable support [...] Rollers specified to perform up to 100,000 cycles at 150 lbs load test.""

3. [This hardware kit for $25.99](https://www.amazon.com/Garage-Door-Hardware-Kit-tune-Kit/dp/B00BD6M3MI/); it has hinges too (which I don't think I need) but includes rollers with 11-ball bearings. 

So I guess the question comes down to which bearings are best? The way the more expensive one proudly lists the bearing model, I am guessing it's better than the unnamed bearings in the cheaper rollers? Does fewer balls mean that each ball is bigger which is better? Or is bearing quality virtually independent of number of balls? Is my inclination to go with #2 correct?

Then beyond bearing quality, is there any reason why nylon wouldn't be a good choice with my wicked heavy door? Does the weight make it more likely for them to warp or delaminate or something and sticking with metal wheels would be better?

Thank you!

^1 It's a 40 year old door, not built out of pressure treated wood, with a repaved driveway that caused water issues, with a foam seal just nailed into the bottom board. Shockingly, that bottom 2x4 was rotted halfway through. I was planning to just pull that board off and replace it with a new 16' pressure treated one, but getting into it, it became clear that the plywood is worthless too, and clean disassembly would be impossible anyway. Rebuilding a whole new panel from scratch is going to be relatively easy and transferring the TnG cedar should be fine too."

Remember this thread? I made it awhile back and the issue never fixed itself. We tried every fix listed, absolutely everything here tried, and failed.

Turns out, we had a pipe leak from our garbage disposal. Leaking sewage, and you know what was right next to the disposal? The air vents.

At first, it was the start of the flies. Then, it was the bathrooms and the master bedroom. These were directly on the same vent line from the hazard zone, and caused an awful smell in there. Along with the bathroom directly next to the line. Then, the disposal gets clogged.

We rod it out, and find out the pipe was held together by literal FUCKING duct tape. PVC to Copper. After we removed the duct tape, all, hell, broke, loose.

The pipe crack was unleashed in full force.

The whole house smelled like the twelfth dimension of all hells. Flies were doubling, we were killing 40-50 a day. We would run the disposal, dishwasher, or sink, and it would post water into the floor where the sink was. That drawer was so humid it felt like Vietnam or some shit. We finally found the culprit at this point though, it was a cracked pipe. We jackhammered through the floor, and finally replaced it. Filled it back in with gravel and cement.

It's been almost 5 days since this has happened and the fly issue has retracted down to 3 for mornings. No more awful smells, and everything is seemingly back to normal. We still gotta wait on the flies to die out.

Sorry if this is self blogging, this has been developing for two years and wanted to get it off my chest for how insane this whole ordeal was."

A.  Batten insulation between the floor joists without a vapor barrier.
B.  Rigid insulation cut to fit between the floor joists and sealed around the edges with spray foam. 

A seems to think that B will trap moisture and rot the rim joists. 

B seems to think that A won't do a good job insulating.

1. Since I am replacing my current 150A panel I figure it is worth it to just go to a 200A panel. Good idea? Is there any cost difference to go up even more? The panels are similar prices. Does the electric company charge more for a higher hookup? Why not just get a 250A or more?


2. How do I find a good licensed electrician. I am new to the area. Other than just a Google search what should I do? Is there any sort of qualifications I should be looking for for this work? 


3. The electric meter is outside the garage and the breaker panel is inside the garage. Is the breaker panel considered an indoor panel since it's in the garage or is the garage considered outdoor? The garage is attached to the house.


4. Do they replace the electric meter outside of the garage too?


5. How many spaces should I get? I see 20, 30, 42 etc... Is it just safer to get more in case I need to add stuff? I have plenty of room for the panel in the garage so size doesn't matter. 


6. For breakers I see they have regular breakers, GFCI breakers, afci breakers, combo GFCI afci breakers, etc. Should I be looking at some of these options?

My plan is to buy primer, normally for self-leveling mix which isn't mentioned as being needed with the Underlayment mix, and put it down after removing all the loose concrete. Then put another batch of the 25 lb Underlayment mix down.

Am I doing this wrong? After I do this large area (15 sq ft or so) I've a bunch of spot fix places to do it that are also on this horrible particle board subfloor."

Garage door opener stopped working and I need help troubleshooting.,HomeImprovement,0,dfam33,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dfam33/garage_door_opener_stopped_working_and_i_need/,6,1570616735.0,"Like the title says.

Symptoms are that the garage door opener will not function. The unit clicks continuously from one of the relays with or without pressing the buttons on the wall switch. It stops clicking at random short intervals for no apparent reason.

The garage door opens and closes freely when the door is unlatched from the chain drive of the opener. Lights are illuminated on the photo-sensors (one green and one yellow). There are no indicator lights blinking on the unit. The wall switch lights blink along with the continual blinking of the relay. There is no visible wear on the gears or other internal components.

Wiring and limit switches were mechanically (not electrically) checked to see if it was linked to the random short stops in clicking and, at first, it seemed *almost* like it had an affect. However, after looking into those options in detail they don't seem to be the cause. The board was removed and inspected and all solder points appear to be in good condition and there was no obvious damage or defects, though there did appear to be *very slight* smoke marks on some of the components."
Replaced my tub faucet; how can I cover up this hole?,HomeImprovement,3,df5lup,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/df5lup/replaced_my_tub_faucet_how_can_i_cover_up_this/,4,1570594841.0,"[Here](https://imgur.com/Y4uBTnD) is a link to what I'm talking about.


Both the new and old trim are Delta.  The old trim had an unnecessary anchor that left this hole.  


I assume that the easiest solution is to just get a chrome plate that would cover it up.  The folks at the plumbing supply store didn't have one, but they also spent no effort to think of something that would work.  If I have to, I'm willing to repair the fiberglass (?) of the tub, but that sounds like much more time and work.  


That said, I'll take solutions for either.  Anyone know where I can get a chrome plate that would fit well enough?"
New Windows or New A/C systems? - Florida resident,HomeImprovement,15,deyl3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/deyl3w/new_windows_or_new_ac_systems_florida_resident/,33,1570562582.0,"I have crapping single-pane, 1995-original aluminum windows that don't keep any heat out at all.
I also have 2 15-year-old, R-22, 3-ton A/C systems (two-story home).

Replacing all the windows will cost about $20K (many quotes, all about the same).
Having 2 units, replacing the A/C systems will cost around $15K (guess-timate, no real quotes yet).

I'm expecting to have the funds shortly to be able to do 1 of these improvements, but not both. It'll take 1-2 years to save up enough to do the second improvement.

**So, as a Florida homeowner, which improvement should I prioritize?**

* New A/C would use the new, cheaper refrigerant, as well as cool more efficiently. But this efficient A/C would still be lost to the heat and crappy design of the aluminum windows.
* New windows will be great, but there's no guarantee how much longer the 15-year-old A/C units will last. I'm concerned at the cost of having to do emergency repair of the A/C. *FWIW, I've lived in this home for 2 years and the only maintenance problem has been a touchy kick-start compressor on the downstairs unit.*

Note: I've had multiple pros tell me my attic insulation is good - don't have to worry about that."
Balancing a ceiling fan?,HomeImprovement,17,dey5uy,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/dey5uy/balancing_a_ceiling_fan/,13,1570559836.0,"My living room has a very high vaulted ceiling with a ceiling fan attached - the fan is maybe 15' off the floor, and is attached with a ~4' pole to the ceiling.

The fan has developed a pronounced wobble. It's enough that we don't want to have it on, as we don't want to be that family on the news that was found dead after the ceiling fan detached and decapitated them all. 

But I *loathe* trying to balance a ceiling fan, especially one this high off the floor. Maybe I'm just bad at it, but I'm hoping there's something else that can be done (short of my Plan B, which is ""get a new fan""). 

Other than repeated trial and error of putting those little weights on one fan blade or another, does anyone have any recommendations for how to remove the worrying wobble from a ceiling fan like this?"

Right insulation for ducts?,HomeImprovement,5,df24ib,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/df24ib/right_insulation_for_ducts/,9,1570579787.0,"Just bought a 1950s house and I'm trying to improve the efficiency in the crawlspace. The ductwork is completely uninsulated currently. 

My understanding is that R-8 insulation is recommended and my searching has turned up some pretty simple instructions of how to apply it. All the how-tos talk about fiberglass duct wrap but searching for stuff to buy turns up a lot of results of foam core insulation without fiberglass, like this: https://smile.amazon.com/AES-HVAC-Insulation-Reflective-Sided/dp/B07BX3W37T/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=r-8+duct+wrap&qid=1570550012&sr=8-4

Would that product work well?

If I don't have to deal with fiberglass that'd be great. It seems like what I need since the R-value is right, but I just wanted to confirm that would work for my needs before I bought it."
