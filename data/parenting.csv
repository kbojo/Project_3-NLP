My partner is leaving me in the middle of an adoption.,Parenting,385,dh3d9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dh3d9k/my_partner_is_leaving_me_in_the_middle_of_an/,34,1570955236.0,"Me and my partner have been together for about 5 years. About 1.5 years ago, we mutually decided to foster a child. We were both excited about this. A few months ago, we agreed to proceed with adoption of the child we had been fostering since last year (9). Last week, my partner claimed he wants to leave. It was, in his words, because we have grown apart, because he feels there is a lack of connection between him and the child, and because he feels empty about the life we have. We live in the countryside, far from his family, and this, he has said, has taken a toll on him.
I questioned all of these, of course, but mostly his desire to leave an already broken child. I will admit, fostering this child has been a challenge but one that I thought we were managing well.

This is destroying me. I am a wreck. I do not want to give up on this child but I cannot do it alone. I break down every time I think about doing this by myself ‚Äî it is not something I was prepared for. My partner and I had been co-parenting this kid. I will admit the child has grown closer to me, but mostly because My partner‚Äôs work schedule meant he was often out when the kid was awake.

After singing the number and repeating it over and over (for weeks) she still wasn't getting it. So I pulled an asshole mom move. 

I set my phone number to be the password to get into her tablet. Guess how long it took her to memorize it? Less than 1 day. HOURS. üôÑ 

I honestly feel stupid that I didn't do that a year ago, and I will be locking my 3yo's tablet shortly. That's a long sequence for a 3yo to remember, but she can always ask her sister for help.

A tiny speech therapy victory,Parenting,208,dgwavw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dgwavw/a_tiny_speech_therapy_victory/,15,1570921531.0,"I've posted a couple times about my 3-year old son who is slowly beginning to talk. He repeats a fair bit of what me and the wife say but doesn't include much spontaneous language. He started speech therapy, and I've been watching videos about how to prompt spontaneous speech.

I immediately learned that I'm not giving proper feedback. I can be subtle and quiet. I'll give him a high five and sometimes say good job, BUT I've been giving him high fives for no reason sometimes, so he doesn't see that as positive feedback.

Instead, for the last couple nights, I've been giving him what I like is over the top positive feedback. LOUD but not deafening, exaggerated encouragement, and sometimes picking him up, smothering him with hugs and kisses and tickles, which he laughs at and loves.

Last night, before bed, I was trying to prompt him to ask for something. 

I modeled asking him for a hug, by just saying ""I"" and having my arms out for a hug. My goal is to make him say ""want hug.""

Instead of giving me a hug, he said, ""No, want book"" and reached off the end of the bed to a bookshelf and grabbed a book.

I gave him a hug anyway.","A tiny speech therapy victoryI've posted a couple times about my 3-year old son who is slowly beginning to talk.

Daughter is being reintroduced to biological father who has a conviction for battery against me,Parenting,46,dh1h3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dh1h3n/daughter_is_being_reintroduced_to_biological/,22,1570945849.0,"So for a bit of background I was with my daughters father for about 14 months, we conceived my daughter not long after meeting and she wasn‚Äôt planned. The whole relationship I knew I didn‚Äôt want to be with him but it was hard to leave, he was both physically and mentally abusive, I don‚Äôt want to go into too much detail but I will mention some of the events that have caused me to feel the way that I do now.. he once drove his car really fast, over taking cars and swinging it back into the lane again whilst screaming he was going to crash and kill us all (my daughter was then only around 3 weeks old) I was screaming and crying begging him to stop and he eventually did. Another time he held me at knife point whilst our daughter lay crying and told me if I tried to pick her up he would kill us both. He would also threaten to abduct her if I ever even thought about leaving him and that I would never see her again. 

Anyway when the time was right after he had beaten me one final time I did leave, grabbed what I could and jumped out of the window (he used to lock us inside so I couldn‚Äôt leave whenever he went out) and ran with my 2 month old baby all the way to the police station (he had smashed my phone up a few days prior). He was arrested that night and the police women told me that she had been a special domestic violence officer for 10 years and from everything I had told her it wouldn‚Äôt have been long before I was seriously injured or even worse. He was convicted for battery on me, I didn‚Äôt really have any evidence so they couldn‚Äôt charge him with more. The police officer got a solicitor to contact me and I gained a residency order and a prohibited steps order that prevented him from any unsupervised contact and from taking her out of my care. I told them that I was happy for contact to take place as long as it was a safe environment and so a contact centre was set up. 

The first few weeks were fine except he would constantly come into the safe room that I was in to try and talk to me, things escalated and he would ask for meetings with me all the time and when I refused as I didn‚Äôt feel safe around him he would get really angry and aggressive, on one occasion he locked himself in the toilet with my daughter and refused to come out when the staff were banging on the door and shouting for him to unlock it, another time he threatened to bring his family to the contact centre and attack the staff, finally he tried to abduct her and when he couldn‚Äôt and was sent home he rung NSPCC and told them I was abusing my daughter and a police officer was sent round to my house who saw everything was fine and wrote it off as a malicious call thankfully! But after that the contact was stopped by the centre staff and by court. 

Social services then said he had to complete a domestic violence perpetrators course if he wanted any sort of contact in the future. He kept re applying to court and not attending the course and so each time it was ordered for no more contact to take place. After the 3rd time they ordered that he had to go away and complete the course and put a ban on him applying for 2 years. 

My daughter is 5 now and didn‚Äôt know who he is, she is very settled, has lots of friends, loves school and is happy. The beginning of last year we received a letter to say he has applied back and that he has now done the course, eventually it was ordered that contact should take place again in a centre and the first session was today.

She really enjoyed it and although she doesn‚Äôt quite understand fully who he is she seemed to have a nice time playing with the new toys and getting gifts. All night she has been saying how she can‚Äôt wait to go back again, iv been really positive in front of her and telling her how nice it is that‚Äôs she‚Äôs had such a nice time and we will be going again soon but after I put her to bed all iv done is cry.

On one hand I know he is her father and she has a right to know him. I‚Äôm happy that she is happy and I wouldn‚Äôt want her to be upset or scared.
But on the other I know who he was in the past and it absolutely terrifies me, what if this goes well and he gets unsupervised contact? What if he doesn‚Äôt bring her back to me or if anything happens to her? What if he drives in the car whilst she‚Äôs there like he did that once before? 
It also upsets me a little that I have to put on this front and let her think he‚Äôs amazing. In her 5 years she has never received any money for her or me for her upbringing or received any gifts for her birthday or Christmas. It‚Äôs all been down to me struggling through university and holding down a job whilst being a single parent. 
Another thing I‚Äôm worried about is his lies, he really does tell a lot, it‚Äôs really worrying, he actually believes them himself and lives in a sort of fantasy world. He shouts out at court that he has never done anything wrong, iv made everything up and that he will tell her all of this. 

I guess what I‚Äôm asking is has anyone else been through this? What happened? Have you got older children that may have been through this and what do they think now? How did you cope with the anxiety?","Daughter is being reintroduced to biological father who has a conviction for battery against meSo for a bit of background I was with my daughters father for about 14 months, we conceived my daughter not long after meeting and she wasn‚Äôt planned.

Had my first experience with birthday party no-shows AND non-RSVPing guests,Parenting,45,dh14te,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dh14te/had_my_first_experience_with_birthday_party/,20,1570944213.0,"I know people are busy. I get that life gets crazy with kids and jobs and all that. Totally understand. But why oh why do people do these things?

Six kids from my son‚Äôs class RSVPd to me via text saying their kids would be there and were excited. I made goodie bags for everyone, and made party games that were specifically for that number of kids. Three of them showed up. 

But prior to the party, two people RSVPd way late. Like, two days before the party. Which made me have to run out to the store and buy more items for additional goodie bags. (Which, of course, it turns out I didn‚Äôt need to do, because of the ones that didn‚Äôt show.)

ETA: one of them was my son‚Äôs bud who kept telling him that she was coming, but I hadn‚Äôt heard from her parents. So I texted the mom (they‚Äôre divorced) and asked if she knew if dad was bringing her since it‚Äôs his weekend. THEN I got the text from him informing me that she‚Äôd be there....so I imagine if I hadn‚Äôt texted mom, he never would have said anything and just showed up. 

No one is so busy that they can‚Äôt send a text to RSVP. Especially when the invites are sent almost *a month* in advance and I gave a very generous window. 

And for fuck‚Äôs sake, if you say you‚Äôre coming, try to actually come. Luckily it wasn‚Äôt a situation where my son was hurt by it, or one where no one showed up (those stories break my heart), but still annoying.","Had my first experience with birthday party no-shows AND non-RSVPing guestsI know people are busy.

Update: How to tell daughter about murder-suicide,Parenting,10,dh6al9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dh6al9/update_how_to_tell_daughter_about_murdersuicide/,0,1570971956.0,"Thank you so so much to every single person who gave advice or shared your experiences. I didn't reply to very many of you because I was feeling overwhelmed by the topic too but I read every single comment.

I had my daughter join me for a walk outside (if you didn't read the thread you can find it in my post history and look at the top comment - the top comment is why I had us go outside). I kept in mind a mixture of all the comments.

I told her that I had really hard news to tell her and asked if she wanted to hold hands when I told her, because it was horrible news. She did want to hold hands, so we did. 

I told her that her friend Julia, and all Julia's family, had died. 

I told her that it was such a bad situation that it was in the news and I said I would like to tell her the basic fact of how it happened since it would really suck to see it in the newspaper or learn about it online first, since she'd probably eventually hear about it in some form online. I asked if she agreed about that. She said she did.

So I told her that Julia's father was mentally ill in a very, very unusual way. A way that doesn't mean anything about most mentally ill people at all, and I pointed out that she and I both know people with mental illnesses who we know are really kind and wouldn't do anything to anyone. But that nobody who's happy and well-adjusted ever does what Julia's father did, so that's why I mentioned mental illness. And what Julia's father did was shoot Julia, Julia's siblings, and Julia's mother.

I admit I started crying and then when I cried my daughter also started crying.

I'm pretty honest with my daughter so when we were both breathing normally again and not sobbing our guts out I said that I was sorry to have to tell her such horrific news. I said any way she mourns, any way at all, is normal. Being stoic, crying a lot, wanting to talk, not wanting to talk... finding it hard to concentrate on other things or concentrating  more on other things... anything. I told her absolutely every way a person could possibly react is still normal.

I also told her therapy has helped me deal with emotionally hard things and that if she wants to go to a therapist who's very good at helping people who are grieving, I would immediately make her an appointment with that sort of therapist.

She said she wanted to talk about it more again when we went back inside, with my husband, but then not talk about it again with us until/unless she asks us to talk about it more. She also said she wanted to talk about it with her health teacher before deciding about a therapist because she thinks her health teacher is very helpful and she's already talked to her health teacher about emotional things. I said that was a good idea to talk to a teacher she trusts. I also said I bet her health teacher already knew about it, because my daughter seemed confused about how to tell someone what happened. I told her I'd also been confused about how to tell someone what happened, so confused and scared I'd asked for advice. (You guys.) 

I asked if she wanted to ask my husband/her step-dad to come outside too since going on walks can make talking easier and she said no, she wanted to talk on the couch. The three of us talked about it like that. Not about details of the event. Just about how miserable the event made us. She and I cried some more. 

The person who said your son's friend died and it turns out your son was much closer to that friend than you realized - I remembered that and it turns out that was true here too.

I don't know. It's been tough since then but I think we are doing well considering how horrible the situation is. I think I did okay. She's wanted infinite hugs and she's also needed a lot of time with us before she goes to bed. About an hour of sitting in her room and talking (about stuff that isn't THIS). Then she can sleep. 

I guess we'll see how it goes from here.","Update: How to tell daughter about murder-suicideThank you so so much to every single person who gave advice or shared your experiences. I didn't reply to very many of you because I was feeling overwhelmed by the topic too but I read every single comment.

When kids break stuff accidentally,Parenting,251,dgss37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dgss37/when_kids_break_stuff_accidentally/,78,1570900486.0,"This is just some rambling thoughts I'm having today, prompted by my son dropping a bowl. 

I remember my parents getting very angry with me whenever I accidentally broke stuff. This made me scared to tell them, which caused them to get angry when I didn't tell them I'd broken something. 

This, to me, seems like a very ineffective parenting strategy. All they did was make me afraid. I think they did so in other ways too. I don't really blame them, my parents both come from very difficult home situations, such as narcissism, alcoholism and neglect. 

But I catch myself doing similar things now, which is something I really don't want to be doing. I stopped myself and instead praised my son for trying to put his bowl away after finishing breakfast, and I told him it's okay, and sometimes accidents happen. 

I think I did the right thing in the end but I just wished it was my first response to these things. 

I feel like I've never really been taught how to parent, and it's really frustrating to find out after having children how bad my childhood actually was. I mean, as far as I know, I was never physically abused, but I wasn't raised very well either. 

Idk why I'm even posting this, I just need to put these thoughts somewhere I think.","When kids break stuff accidentallyThis is just some rambling thoughts I'm having today, prompted by my son dropping a bowl.

How do you think I should handle telling another parent that their kid stole from my kid?,Parenting,4,dh4g9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dh4g9b/how_do_you_think_i_should_handle_telling_another/,5,1570961080.0,"Disclaimer: 

I don't go around interfering in my daughter's social issues and problems, and I don't go around complaining to other parents about their kids every time my daughter is upset. This case is different because my daughter wants me to get involved, whereas in the past she's always felt best about working things out just between her and whatever other kid.

Situation: 

My daughter is in the sixth grade. One of her best friends from elementary school is kinda doing a ""mean girl"" thing now that they've hit middle school. Her former bestie (who we'll call Lisa) stole twenty dollars from my daughter. Lisa then proceeded to buy herself and a third little girl some stuff. (The third little girl had no idea this was stolen money, and she was really sorry when she realized, and so of course my daughter's not upset with her. So she's not really relevant.)

The next day, after my daughter mentioned being upset because my daughter believed she'd lost twenty dollars, Lisa gave her back the money that was unspent (""I borrowed it"") but told her that she wouldn't pay back the part she'd spent. Lisa had some absurd justifications for not paying it back, and claims my daughter is ""being annoying"" for finding this upsetting. Now she just rolls her eyes and walks away when my daughter tries to talk to her, so my daughter can't get anywhere by just trying to talk to Lisa.

I asked my daughter how she wants to move forward. Is she hoping for an apology? Does she just want the money back? Does she want to tell Lisa's mom? Etc. 

My daughter decided she simply wants Lisa to have some sort of consequence and that, since my daughter has no ability to mete out any sort of consequence, she would like me to tell Lisa's mom. I agreed that I will do this.

Lisa's mom is a lovely person. I'm not close friends with her, but I've still spent a fair bit of time with her over the years because of our daughters' friendship, and from all my observations she's a great mom. I do think she would very much want to know about this. 

But how should I phrase it? How should I bring it up? I've never had to tell another parent that their kid was being crappy. (Obviously I will not say, ""Your kid is being crappy."") 

Should I make sure to say it in a phone call? I know it's so easy for texts to be misunderstood. Should I ask to swing by her home to talk about something? I've only ever been there when my daughter was there. 

I certainly don't want to approach this in a rude or angry manner. Like I said, I like and respect this woman, believe her to be a good mother, and feel confident she would want to know this. I also don't want her to feel like I am mad at HER or blame her for this in some way -- I don't, at all.

My son has absence seizures. When he has an absence seizure, his brain basically shuts off. He'll stare into space, stop blinking and stop breathing. It lasts anywhere from 15 seconds to a couple of minutes. He's been been diagnosed with CAE and the school are aware of his diagnosis but I still get school reports and meetings stating my son is ""falling asleep"" in class and ""daydreaming"". Obviously not day dreaming when he isn't even breathing at the time. I've explained to his teacher in meetings, but she will not listen.

Will anything happen if I make a complaint or am I wasting my time?","How would I go about making a complaint to my child's school?The school are ignoring my child's epilepsy in their reports and claiming he falls asleep in class and is ""lazy"" and ""uninterested"".

I was fairly content then. She studied once a week since last year. She would skip days and I let her. I didn't pressure her to study and just gave her reminders for the exam. To make it short, it was more of a casual review for an entrance exam, not an extensive type must-pass review.

The second other students arrived though, I was surprised. It felt like we arrived at a professional license exam rather than an entrance exam. There were teachers giving last minute tips. There are students with some last minute study papers. It really felt like they were about to go into war with their mind as their weapon. I half-expected drums to sound off from a distance. When they fell in line to go to the examination area, their teacher shouted, ""Ready?"" And they replied in unison, ""Ready!"" You can tell they've been extensively preparing for this for months!

Oh my God. I questioned myself. Did I just fail to support my child educationally? Because all the others were so ready. A lot of them also finished the exams early. Many said it was easy and that after seeing the questions, they are now sure they will pass. My daughter said Science and Math weren't easy for her.

What to do about 6th grade English teacher who doesn‚Äôt teach grammar because of the app ‚Äúgrammarly‚Äù,Parenting,62,dgt1dz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dgt1dz/what_to_do_about_6th_grade_english_teacher_who/,53,1570902343.0,"It‚Äôs 4:30 in the morning and I can‚Äôt sleep. I‚Äôm haunted by a conversation I had with my son‚Äôs 6th grade teacher yesterday,

This teacher does not work from a book, guide or website. There is no outline or syllabus.  No handouts. There is no homework. Everything is done in class. She posts grades online, without attaching the work - so parents can‚Äôt see what their kid is doing.

2 days ago he had to finish his in-class work at home, so I get a glimpse of what‚Äôs going on.

Unfortunately, his answers for part of the assignment are riddled with misspellings and grammatical errors. And she has already graded it: A-.

I worked on the answer with him for the unfinished portion, and my daughter (3.8 gpa in nursing school) looks it over as well for errors. 

It‚Äôs asking a convoluted question about the story he just read - and because I have no reference (books, syllabus, etc.) he does his best. He submitted it 2 days ago - yesterday he received a B-.

Apparently he answered the question wrong. When I ask her how we would have gotten clarity on the question, she responded, ‚Äúhe needs to ask me‚Äù. So I suggest a handout explaining assignments - which she refused. 

When I said that there was no way for me to help him because I didn‚Äôt have any reference to what she is looking for, she said I needed to ask my son what she meant. But if he knew what she meant he wouldn‚Äôt have gotten it wrong....ugh.

Then we moved on to the A- for subpar work. She grades on the ‚Äúidea‚Äù, which is great - but his writing needs work.  He needs to be learning some 6th grade grammar skills. Which I discover she does not teach. She feels they will just ‚Äúpick up‚Äù proper grammar techniques organically. Then she says it-

‚ÄúKids don‚Äôt really need grammar anymore, they can just cut and paste into grammarly.‚Äù

This is his only English class.

She then goes on to say he is allowed to revise the answer for credit. It‚Äôs a lengthy answer (3-4 sentences). So I say, ‚Äúgreat, he just needs to rewrite the paragraph?‚Äù To which she says - ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a paragraph - it‚Äôs an answer‚Äù.  

Then she tells me the ‚Äúrevision‚Äù will ask the same question - but from a different story. 

So I say, ‚Äúso, it‚Äôs a new project‚Äù, and she responds- no, it‚Äôs a revision. I push back and say - ‚Äúwriting a whole new response to a different story is not a revision‚Äù ...and she rolls her eyes and says if I can come up with a better word she is open. 

Am I taking crazy pills????

I actually had to google what a paragraph was and what revision meant after the meeting because I started to doubt my own understanding.

Am I wrong to be nervous? Should I just let it go and teach him grammar from a workbook at home?","What to do about 6th grade English teacher who doesn‚Äôt teach grammar because of the app ‚Äúgrammarly‚ÄùIt‚Äôs 4:30 in the morning and I can‚Äôt sleep.

My 16yo son doesn't care about anything,Parenting,7,dh1k49,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dh1k49/my_16yo_son_doesnt_care_about_anything/,7,1570946236.0,"Hello everyone.

I'm the mother to a 16 years old boy and i'm very worried about his well being. 

He won't sign up for any activity or assiociation at his school, he tries to avoid at any cost going to friends house when he is invited, he hasn't invited a friend over at our house in years, doesn't want to participate in family stuff even when it's supposed to be fun for him (like Christmas or family parties).

He has never been a hard kid to deal with from a pragmatic point of view, he performs well in school (but I will get to that later), does his chores when asked to. He is also very calm and he generally obeys us with little to no trouble. We used to joke with my husband that there must be something wrong with him because he obeys so easily even as a teenager, but now I feel like it actually might be a manifestation of something deeper. 

On the flip side, it is incredibly hard to connect to him emotionnally or physically. He refuses any contact whether in the form of hugging, kissing or simply playing around, and he NEVER speaks about his emotions. When asked ""how is it going in school, do you get along with other kids"" he always replies with ""yes everything is fine"". It is seems impossible to get something out of him that comes from the heart.

What you should know is that he's an extremely bright kid. He was always the best in school, he knows a lot about politics and economics. He also started playing guitar at 10 and improved faster than all the other kids and then he just stopped. I feel like this is the root of the issue. He starts being interested in something, does very well at it, and then he simply loses interest and either switch to doing nothing or doing something else. I know that he recently got into programming, and was quite enthusiastic, saying that it opened a world of possibilities. But a few weeks later he dropped it saying it doens't matter anyway. And that's what he always say. He doesn't want to play the guitar anymore because it doesn't matter, he doesn't want to get involved in a politics association ( even though he does seem interested by politics ), because it doesn't matter, doesn't want to go to his friends house because it doesn't matter. He does keep his grades up but i'm convinced that it's because he know we are going to bother him otherwise, not because he actually cares about it. We proposed to offer him a trip to Europe with other kids at a summer camp, but he doens't want to. He just wants to be left alone, always. Once when he was 12, a girl offered him some pastry and a letter (apparently with a romantic intent) and he simply threw everything in the thrash, saying that he barely spoke to that girl and he doesn't know why she would be interested in him. He also forgets to wish birthday to us or his sister, and when confronted about it simply says sorry but it really doesn't feel like he actually is sorry. I already tried opening up to him and told him that I was hurting, that I didn't understand what was going on in his mind, and it breaks my heart to say it, but he really didn't seem to care. 

I wasn't really worried about all this at first because that's the way he""s always been, and his sister (21) is a happy young woman with plenty of friends, I just figured that at some point he would change, but I feel like it's only gotten worse over the years.

Me and my husband are completely lost, we don't know what to do. We are not even sure that we should do something.

Right now I'm going through a miscarriage it started 9/30 and I figured it was a normal period. It got real this past Tuesday (10/8) bleeding was bad, worse than when I had my second (first live birth ended in life support decisions for brain death) based on things I saw (passed tissue / fetus) and was told at the ER I was about 6-8 weeks along. I figured at most maybe 3 or 4. My pregnancies are not necessarily difficult but prone to not textbook symptoms. 

I have been oscillating between hormonally sad and just how do I cope what do I say to people, stoic because I want and need to support my husband and angry that everyone is handling this with kid gloves or acting like I must be okay or throwing sympathy with a dash of pity, because I'm still trying to keep on keeping on; honestly I'm stubborn as heck. I don't know how upset I'm allowed to be because so many folks rely on me keeping the house and family together it's a whole post on it's own. My husband has been super supportive and I'm trying to reciprocate and feel like I'm failing.

The weeks prior to this I had a massively stubborn headcold where getting out of bed wasn't happening (clue one that I'm probably pregnant) with daily rolling nausea (clue two). The normal OTC tests don't register positives with me for whatever reason, blood work at the ER did confirm that it was positive.

My in-laws while being supportive and picking up my slack around the house have also felt the need to inform people for me about it as they were in the room against my want; we asked they wait in the waiting room they insisted for support purposes. All I wanted was me, my husband and a change of pants. It was not a fun experience and I felt like it was more spectator sport than me getting the care I needed. Can't change the past but I now for sure what I should do if there's a next time (I hope like hell there's not) to anyone going through this right now you have my deepest sympathies.

My hormones are doing their thing so if I'm not crying, I'm feeling intensely frisky, which after reading on miscarriage is a thing. I don't even know if I'm grieving the way I need to because I am all over the damn road. Yes I'm sad, but also need to be close to my husband it's confusing but I'm working on it.

Am I allowed to cry, because we were trying for this, am I allowed to be angry that people know on someone else's terms because support? I don't want pity, I want to be able to talk about it. If I get pregnant again there will be at least an 7 / 8 year gap between my first and second child. We've been trying for a while. I'm afraid they won't be close. Should I just stop at one? There's fertility issues at play, and a csection.

I'm on bed rest for at least a week. I've got my child by myself right now because the inlaws decided to go out I must be doing okay right? Hubby is at work it's unavoidable he just doesn't have the time and I wouldn't ask because his parents are here or well they are usually. 

I don't even know what sub to post in. I just need some outside support I guess.","Can we discuss this without it being taboo?Trigger warning: Mentions of female bodily fluids, mildly gorish reference to periods, natural miscarriage.

He's not really athletic, so most ""normal things (bowling, batting, etc.) have no appeal. We've looked into and ruled out:

Abusive mom as a grandparent,Parenting,3,dh2muk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dh2muk/abusive_mom_as_a_grandparent/,7,1570951465.0,"Ok so a little background. I am married to a very supportive husband and have a vibrant, precious 2 year old son. I am a full time working mom and my husband is a stay at home dad. For the last 7 years we have lived several states away from my mother. I have just accepted a new position in my hometown (where my mom lives) after being recruited by a company that offered me a very good step up in my career. 

I am very excited about the development except for one issue. I had a very turbulent childhood due in large part to my mother‚Äôs addiction and mental health struggles. My husband and I are also recovering alcoholics with 10+ years of sobriety. So he is not totally unfamiliar with these types of issues. The problem is that I recently shared with my husband some of the traumatic memories of my childhood (for example, my mother a couple of times pretended to kill herself to see how I would react when I was 5-6 years old). 

My mother is very different now. She has mellowed a great deal, gotten significant therapy, and hasn‚Äôt used drugs for about 3 years. But my husband says he doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable allowing our son to be with my mother unattended. My mom doesn‚Äôt work, is single, and alone most of the time. She is so excited for us to come back and says she can‚Äôt wait to pick my son up, take him around town, and spoil him rotten.

I‚Äôm so anxious about all of this. It is difficult to transmit the full picture, but so much of my family‚Äôs dysfunction and family roles were tied up in me taking care of my mom, saving her from herself, not rocking the boat, keeping secrets from the outside world, etc. that I recognize my anxiety also stems from feeling like I have betrayed her by telling my husband. And fear over hurting her (lest some really bad things happen). 

I also feel guilty for contemplating allowing my son to be around her and risking his safety because it feels justified that she is different now and doing so allows me to pretend that abuse didn‚Äôt happen. But I also wonder if she should be punished for something that happened 25 years ago? Our lives and her personality are so much bigger than the one story. But on the other hand, there was more abuse than that one story too.

I just feel so scared when I think about navigating this.

Baby Gate Advice,Parenting,3,dh17x6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dh17x6/baby_gate_advice/,9,1570944625.0,"So here's where I'm at, my wife and I have a 2 year old and a 1 year old. Due to the house, they share a bedroom. They are both in cribs. The older child learned how to crawl out of his crib. I know the internet says he's ready for toddler bed, but not in this situation. Little dude has already crawled into his little sister's bed and woken her up at all hours, and even in spite of that, he just won't stay in there, he wants to play and he's gonna do it no matter what.

So I turned his crib around, cause the side that faces the wall has a headboard type thing on it that comes up high. But then he was just sitting on the edge of the crib bars looking out the window, and I figured that wasn't safe. So I swapped his crib with his sister's, no window there. Then he figured out he could push the crib from the wall and crawl out in the gap (in the old place the crib was wedged in between a dresser and a rocking chair, so it didn't move out).

Also thought about unscrewing the base of the crib and laying it on the ground, but I think the gap will be too much.

So I only have one real idea left. Ditch his crib, throw a mattress on the floor, and divide the room in half with a baby gate. He can have some running around space then without being a terror to his sister (or me waking up to him playing with trucks in the kitchen) and he won't risk falling out of his crib coming up with annoying new toddler methods of escape.

I'm writing this after a long, turbulent afternoon and previous night of him refusing sleep and naps and keeping his sister up. But after successfully getting them to pass out, I have the dilemma that I don't have precise measurements, as I'm not risking entering that room. But it would need to be a baby gate about 8 to 9 feet (96+ inches) long to cut the room in half. Now, I see a few online that long, but especially with a mattress in there, the seemingly standard height of 28 inches will not do at all.

So if anyone has any suggestions for a baby gate both pretty tall and really long (or any bright ideas otherwise to contain him), it would be much appreciated","Baby Gate AdviceSo here's where I'm at, my wife and I have a 2 year old and a 1 year old.

Can‚Äôt stop regretting choices we made,Parenting,11,dgto2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dgto2v/cant_stop_regretting_choices_we_made/,5,1570906781.0,"My first child (5M) hated daycare. We watched him cry everyday at pick up and drop off until he was 2.5 years. So when we had our second (2.5M) and we were financially better off, we hired a nanny. He was a huge baby over 90th percentile. She overstated her experience, but seemed genuine and kindhearted. 

She wasn‚Äôt able to get him to drink milk from a bottle and wasn‚Äôt good at problem solving. We probably should have just fired her, but we already fired a first nanny for putting him in an unsafe sleep situation which could have killed him. I wish I were exaggerating, but she put heavy adult  winter blankets around him and one ended up covering his entire head while he slept and that‚Äôs how I found him. The image of seeing him potentially dead is still seared into my brain.

At least this new nanny seemed to keep him safe and watched over him. And trying to find a new one while working and having already had to take extra time off because the first one failed was just too stressful.

8 months later, though, my child was thin and under 30th percentile. Basically stopped growing. We knew his growth had slowed a little 2 months in at his 6 month checkup, but we didn‚Äôt realize the extent of the problem until the 9 month checkup. We went into full problem solving mode then. She finally quit, but the damage was done. We put him into daycare at 1 year old and he had no issues and was fine.

I know I should be grateful that he‚Äôs healthy and alive, but I can‚Äôt shake my guilt and regret. I can‚Äôt look at his baby pictures without being flooded with the stress I felt at the time. I beat myself up for trying to make things work with bottle feeding instead of just nursing him since I worked from home. I hate myself for putting my job performance above my child. I worry that his speech delays now are because of his nanny basically trying to force feed him milk for hours at a time or that lack of nourishment at the time has caused other delays we can‚Äôt see.

We do the whole checklist - diaper, teething, gas, naps, cuddles, feeding, etc but sometimes the only thing that works is to let her play with whatever it is that has caught her fancy. She stops the shrieking if she gets what she wants.

Is my child better off without me?,Parenting,9,dgsdk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dgsdk8/is_my_child_better_off_without_me/,34,1570897562.0,"I never wanted to have kids however 18 months ago my partner and I had an unplanned pregnancy. I begged her to have an abortion but she refused. For most of my life I was sure I never wanted kids and the only thing that had stopped me getting a vasectomy was family/friends telling me that one day I would change your mind. Therefore, I didn't want to get a vasectomy in case what I was being told was true because there can be a lot of problems reversing it.

Although I have been a father for the last 18 months, my feelings towards being a parent have not changed in the slightest. I will be getting that vasectomy and while it will prevent any further accidents, it doesn't reverse what has already been done. There is literally nothing about being a parent I enjoy and I don't understand why people would choose to be a parent.

The only reason I stay and try to be a father is because I was responsible for his existence and my son is innocent - he doesn't deserve psychological damage by having a parent abandon him.

The sad truth is the only time I feel any joy is when I have left the house and can go out and enjoy my own life freely whether it‚Äôs at work, the gym, with friends - anywhere else but home. From the moment I step in the door, I feel drowned in sadness.  Its got so bad, that now my future feels so hopeless I've stopped exercising, don't even want to socialise and see family or friends, and only enjoy working because its the only thing that distracts me from pain.

So much of my life has being damaged by having a child, quality time spending together alone, social life, getting enough sleep, no time to myself to reset and unwind (I need this daily to function), daily sex whenever we want, having weekends to go and live your own life for you, reading books, coming home from work to relax, travelling unhindered, staying out all night, my happiness, my hope and taking business risks (as other people are now involved).

I want to enjoy having a lifelong career where I regularly get to move cities and/or countries and be able to uproot my life and move it at the drop of a hat. My life needs constant change and big challenges ‚Äì unfortunately being a parent is not one of those challenges that gives me any kind of fulfilment.

For me personally, life isn't worth living if it‚Äôs the same as everyone else's. Kids, buying a house with a partner and living in the in the same city/country your whole life is not a life I want or a life I enjoy or one I would be happy living. I know many people enjoy it and that is fine, but for me personally that is the furthest thing from happiness I can imagine. Some people might take offence to that but the fact is not everyone is the same, and different things give different people joy.

I have exhausted my energy focusing on tying to have a good attitude and perspective about being a father since the moment knew the pregnancy would move forward, each day I try to visualise myself being happy as a parent, I say positive things to myself, I spend time with my son playing with him and hoping that I will stay enjoying at least something, but so often images of what he has cost me both in the short term and the rest of my life flow back into my mind. These feelings about not wanting to be a parent are so ingrained for the 30+ years of my life I honestly have no idea how to change them or if they can be. I don‚Äôt know if what I am doing to change how I feel is wrong or I am just not built this way.

Obviously, I don't want to hurt my son so I try not to let any of these feelings be seeing by him, but on some level, he must feel or see it. I have never hated my life more than since I read the pregnancy test.

If I stay and be his parent, I am living my life for him at the cost of me giving up everything about my relationship and own life that I enjoy. If it keeps going the way it is, I will go through the rest of my life miserable and grow old feeling I have lived a wasted life. Being a child of a parent who is unhappy being a parent must have some sort of long-term damage so staying and things going the way they are is going to damage him. As it stands, I feel all I have to look forward to is a miserable home life then death. These feelings are real for me every day.

I have considered just ending my own life, but then that's another thing that could mess him up, probably even more. This is my most preferred choice but this would not only damage him but also my family, friends and partner.

Another option is just to leave completely and let him live with his mother and him only be surrounded by people who are grateful he is around, but then that could also mess him up when he later wonders why his dad left and comes to the conclusion he wasn‚Äôt wanted. While I might hate being a parent, I do love him and it pains me to see him hurt. Also I worry about how hard it would be for her being a single parent.

I am completely torn about what the right thing is to do and feel exhausted trying to change my perspective and feelings on the situation. Each day only gets harder and I don't know how much longer I can endure this.  

My partner knows how I feel and tries to help me see the positives; she has been extremely resilient and patient with the whole situation but I can‚Äôt expect her to keep going like this either. I stay hopeful there will be some progress, but nothing I do seems to help. This has nothing to do about being ""afraid"" of responsibility, or being a parent. It has to do with getting no joy or fulfilment out of parenting and it taking away all the things in life that do.

I apologise this was so long but felt all information was needed so that an informed solution to this problem could be provided. I assume by most people‚Äôs standards I‚Äôd be considered a horrible person for feeling this way but remember I am here to actually do the right thing so ask you please don‚Äôt use this platform to throw judgement and abuse, I‚Äôm asking for you to instead provide a genuine solution that you feel will have the best possible outcome for all.

When providing a solution please do not think about the money aspect of things (if leaving is your solution), it‚Äôs the quality of life and mental health of everyone I am most concerned about.

The important questions I have are:

1. Has anyone been in this situation and if so, how did it turn out? Are things better?
2. Of all options, what do you think will cause the least damage to my son?

Ever since this school year started she has been telling me how her friends from 2nd grade don't hang out with her anymore. She says she is not being bullied, but she simply doesn't get along with the other kids.

She said kids tell her, ""I don't want to play with you today."" ""You're weird."" 

One of her best friends doesn't talk to her anymore and tells her that she doesn't want to play with her either. 

Yesterday, she told me she felt unwanted and worthless. That nothing has a meaning. 

Honestly, that scared me to the core. I have suffered from depression for years and it scares me to think my 9 year old would feel that way. I don't know if this is a normal thing  kids around this age say and later change. I don't know what to think really.

Are there any parents out there who have had a similar experience with their child?

Kids and faith,Parenting,91,dgi4iq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dgi4iq/kids_and_faith/,146,1570842508.0," So, I used to be a conservative Christian, and I'm not anymore. I'm divorcing my husband, and he is still an Evangelical. My kids are 9 & 12. Husband for some reason insists that I must tell the kids I'm not a Christian anymore. Which probably means he will tell them that if I don't. I've been hesitant, because I don't want them to be afraid of me going to hell, and because I know it would be very confusing for them, and they're already dealing with the divorce situation.

How do I tell them? They have been deeply indoctrinated in Sunday School and weekly Bible classes, which they still go to. I don't think they're really at the natural questioning age yet, and I don't really want to damage their faith. 

I've been considering taking them to a Unitarian Universalist church on my weeks with them in order to help them see a different perspective, but it's tricky. I don't want to force them to do anything they don't want to with regard to faith, and I'd rather not confuse them.","Kids and faith So, I used to be a conservative Christian, and I'm not anymore.

Partner keeps asking for space from us,Parenting,31,dgm0qt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dgm0qt/partner_keeps_asking_for_space_from_us/,33,1570860154.0,"Hi everyone, 
Myself (28f) and my partner (30m) have an 5 month old baby and we had a pretty big fight 10weeks ago. The fight basically consisted of me saying that I wasn‚Äôt going to bring our baby to his parents anymore every Sunday as when he feels like it he will say he no longer wants us there as he wants some space - even when we are ready and about to leave. He can‚Äôt understand how I would ever say such a thing but I feel like it‚Äôs only fair when he will tell us not to come when it suits him. Now let me point out I said I would take him over some days during the week and also they could visit us (which they don‚Äôt do). I was never saying they couldn‚Äôt see him at all. 

Ever since this argument things haven‚Äôt been right - he keeps saying he‚Äôs not over it because he can‚Äôt believe I would say such a thing just because he wanted some alone time. He‚Äôs clearly missing the point. 

Because he can‚Äôt get over this it has caused other arguments since as we keep reverting back to it and now he is away home to his parents for 2 weeks, maybe more to get some more space to try and ‚Äúhit the reset button‚Äù. In this week so far he has made one plan to see his baby and that‚Äôs for a couple of hours this weekend. He still doesn‚Äôt know when he‚Äôs coming home. 

He is very close with his family and I feel like his child hasn‚Äôt taken over the no.1 spot. As an example - I said what shall we do for babies first Christmas and he told me he didn‚Äôt know what I was doing but he was gonna be spending it with his family. No compromise, no consideration for us. He also can‚Äôt seem to move on from a fight like most people.

Has anyone else ever dealt with this kind of thing? What should I do??
I want him to be there more and be emotionally more able to deal with general ups and downs of life without having to run home to his parents for weeks and leave me alone with our baby while he just acts like someone with no responsibilities.

This was very early, before school. So I went through my daughter's hair with a fine tooth comb. She is in early grade school. There was nothing there. I decided to put her hair in little braids and then pull in to a bun at the back. This means, I was definitely looking close at her hair. I used a fine tooth comb to make the little braids too. This was by around seven am. I sent her to school. I actually did not want to send her to school today after finding out someone in the class had lice.  Around 5pm, we are at the store when my daughter tells me her head really itches. It was not itching before. I look at her head in the store and could see tons of little white specks. I google again what it looks like to have head lice and this appears to be it. I quickly leave the store and call my sister who tells me to go get a special shampoo and where. I head to that store. While inside the store, waiting to check out, I can see one small lice bug crawling in her hair! I have been working on her hair for the last three or four hours and she is in bed now.

Here is the part I am really ticked about. My daughter is my eighth child. No other of my children going to public school has ever had lice (but some did home school for a few years in the middle). This child is at a charter school. I found out the little girl, her best friend, was at school today even though she had lice. The school says it is fine for them to come. To top it off, the school never notified any of us about the lice. And they never looked at the kids to screen them for lice. I ended up talking with a parent who has been at the school for longer than us, this is their third year, and both her children have had lice already during the last two years, at this school. I am taking this to mean, the school does not take any sort of measures when lice goes around and it has gone around multiple times, at least three times in two school years and two months of this school year.

I am taking this to mean, the school does not take any sort of measures when lice goes around and it has gone around multiple times, at least three times in two school years and two months of this school year. 

&#x200B;

My husband is very upset. I am upset. I am wondering if this sounds like a fluke, the recurrance, and give them the benefit of the doubt. But, I wonder if, the recurring problem is a result of their inaction to the lice so it keeps happening?"

Need advice,Parenting,10,dgn6kn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dgn6kn/need_advice/,18,1570865798.0,"My five year old daughter (second child) has been testing my patience greatly as of late, and I could use some advice.

Whenever she is asked to get ready to go somewhere/do something and she's already engaged in something else, she flips out. Screams. Cries. Falls flat on the floor and loses her mind. She does it at home, at daycare, you name it.

This started about a year ago. Before now, she was super eager to please and always wanted to be mom and dad's 'good girl'. 

She's super stubborn too, and gets very angry when we confront her on certain behaviours. For example, she was jumping on the couch the other day and I told her to stop because she could hurt herself (and ruin my damn couch, I might add), and she freaked out and started crying/screaming that it's 'not fair' and 'she doesn't love me anymore'.

This morning, my wife told her to get ready for school and she shouted back ""Don't force me! Just let me do what I need to do!""

I'm starting to get to the end of my rope. Little things are causing irrational, inversely proportionate reactions. Big things (like being banned from an activity as punishment for bad behaviour) cause nuclear meltdowns. She only calms down after several minutes of talking about it/hugs/timeout on stairs, etc.

Yes, I know she's five. I'm just at a loss because we never experienced this with our first child (boy, now 10), and everything we've tried isn't working. We're starting to worry, because we don't want the daycare to tell us not to bring her back again because of her freakouts... it's nearly impossible to find a daycare with vacant spots, let alone one as good as the one we found.

Any suggestions?","Need adviceMy five year old daughter (second child) has been testing my patience greatly as of late, and I could use some advice.

When we got to school, she didn‚Äôt cling to me and ran to play with her friends. A big win in my book! So after chatting with the teacher and some parents, I got in my car and drove away. 

After about 10 mins of driving, during which I was touching my face, rubbing my hand through my hair, playing with my phone, and other things you absentmindedly do while driving, I catch a wiff of something weird (as I have my palm rested on my cheek, you see where this is going). I look down and there is a skid mark of brown on my hand! 

I almost wrecked my Jeep while dry heaving the rest of the way home. While driving, I had my trusty go to weapon, wet wipes, which I was rubbing anywhere I can think of that I touched and the smell still didn‚Äôt go away. 

Once I got home, it was like the scene in Ace Ventura when he finds out that Finkelstein is Einhorn. While I am showering (scrubbing the skin off my face), I start trying to figure out where the poop came from. It wasn‚Äôt mine (I hadn‚Äôt gone yet today), my daughter is potty training but as far as I know she was clean, so it must have come from one of the other Petri dish toddlers in the class.

It is part of the reason for my unhealthy connection to food, and when my wife was pregnant we both agreed that would be a set rule.

  
Cue my daughter, my first child. Like a lot of toddlers, she is a walking ball of energy. Constantly moving, always into new things, asking a lot of questions, the usual. She has absolutely no interest in food outside of milk, and while I'm not a psychologist I want to believe it's because she would have to take time out of her day playing to eat, and that is not acceptable to her. I wasn't too worried about it at first because she always had so much energy and I lived by the mantra ""if she's hungry, she'll eat"".

&#x200B;

But we had a doctor's check-up for our youngest and she was pairing up to get a flu shot and on a whim I decided to get her weighed. She had only gained 2 ounces in 6 months, and that was with her clothes on so she might have even lost weight. My wife and I have also been noticing that she wakes up ""trembling"", that we are sure is from low blood sugar, but the girl still doesn't stop. She doesn't exhibit any other symptoms of a child with failure to thrive and by all accounts is a perfectly appropriate toddler (except she has an incredible aversion to other children, but that's a story for another time).

&#x200B;

When she does eat, it's usually cereal (Cheerio's) or rice, MAYBE with a little broccoli or apple on the side. She likes sweets but will only have a bite (unless it's M&M's), and appears to prefer blander foods, which again is okay.

We are worried we'll have to sit her down until she eats more than just a couple bites of rice.

He has been dead set on this for years but has added a few other top ranked non Ivies to his list. 

My husband and I are both UConn grads. I am a kindergarten teacher at a private school and he is an accountant. We have 4 kids, 3 boys and 1 girl. We live in an average suburb with average schools. My husband has 3 siblings who all attended great schools. His brother went to Dartmouth and is now a dentist, one sister went to MIT and is an engineer, and his other sister went to Duke and is a college professor. Their parents had a super laid back attitude. My son may have been inspired by his aunts and uncle because he wants the same for himself. 

I am not sure what to do to help him achieve his goals. He doesn't have any special talents. He is in marching band, cross country, and track. He does well in cross country and track but I doubt it is well enough to have top schools recruiting him.

Should I be doing anything or recommending anything to help him get there?At age 10 my oldest decided that he wanted to go to an Ivy League school for college. He has been dead set on this for years but has added a few other top ranked non Ivies to his list. 

My husband and I are both UConn grads. I am a kindergarten teacher at a private school and he is an accountant. We have 4 kids, 3 boys and 1 girl. We live in an average suburb with average schools. My husband has 3 siblings who all attended great schools. His brother went to Dartmouth and is now a dentist, one sister went to MIT and is an engineer, and his other sister went to Duke and is a college professor. Their parents had a super laid back attitude. My son may have been inspired by his aunts and uncle because he wants the same for himself. 

I am not sure what to do to help him achieve his goals. He doesn't have any special talents. He is in marching band, cross country, and track. He does well in cross country and track but I doubt it is well enough to have top schools recruiting him.

My kid just turned 4. At the beginning of September she started a new classroom (but located at the same daycare she's been at for 2 years, same classmates).

Previously she was a pretty great sleeper. Goes to sleep right away (by 8pm), and waits until her OK To Wake light goes off at 7 to get up. Starting Sept 1 she no longer sleeps through the night. She goes to sleep pretty well (although sometimes not). Then she will get up at midnight, 1, 2, even 5am. Sometimes it's a quiet ""Mommy I can't sleep"" and other times its sobbing and screaming ""i can't sleep!""

We have tried so many things. Reward charts. Praise. Special blankets. Longer bed time routine with quiet time. Taking away fun things (like no TV time). I tried ignoring her (after saying please go back to bed, I am done talking about this) but then she escalates to climbing on top of me to get my attention. I've even told her ""you don't HAVE to sleep. If you really can't sleep, read books or play quietly with your toys"". But she just stands by the side of my bed screaming. 

She doesn't say shes scared of anything, and generally loves her bed and her room.  Sometimes it happens 5-10x a night. We are all exhausted(especially her!!)

I read this method on many different websites: ""If your child gets out of bed, you can say something like ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs time to sleep. Please stay in your bed‚Äô. Then return her gently and calmly to bed, without talking or scolding. Do this as many times as it takes until your child stays in bed.""

The problem with that is, she gets so angry and worked up that she plants her feet and screams no and there is no way to ""calmly and gently"" get her to bed. And of course raising my voice or forcing her into bed would make things worse. 

My pediatrician recommended the book ""what to do when you dread your bed"", but I'm hoping you all have a few ideas for me while I wait for Amazon to deliver it!

My wife's biggest problem is getting my 5 year old ready.

Normally this behavior is handled with timeout and a stern talk but that's not really an option when you need to be out the door in 15 minutes.

Our 9 month year old daughter has only in the last week or so started strongly insisting on being put to bed by her mum. Prior to this she was just as happy to have me put her to bed and soothe her on night waking. But now if I try she screams until her mum takes over. 

This follows a pretty bad virus she has a couple of weeks ago, which got better after a couple of days that both my wife and I attended to her in equal measure. However it did impact on her way of sleeping. Most nights we would remove her from her crib to sleep on my wife to keep her upright as her breathing was affected by her respiratory infection. We realised this may have an adverse effect of her sleeping alone in her crib, but the concern of her breathing was obviously superseding. Then the following week my wife had to catch up on a great deal of work (done at home) and I tended to our daughter through the days without any issues as I have had 3 weeks off work solidly at home with the fam.

Feeding, changing, play, all of these she can have either of us tending to. It‚Äôs just being put down for sleep and reassurance during the night. 

For the most part my wife is her primary carer with the exception of these past couple of weeks. She has still however been ever present and involved with things and our daughters routine is in tact. She will sleep on me only in her sling for naps. 

I understand 9 months is often when the clingy stage can start, and that the illness then my wife‚Äôs work have perhaps pushed it to the fore. However I‚Äôm hoping for at least some resolve that I can let my wife rest as our daughter is waking much more frequently through the night clearly needing reassurance.

Babysitting horror story,Parenting,211,dg21vh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dg21vh/babysitting_horror_story/,140,1570760163.0,"Background- my babysitter, Laura (\*not real name and throwaway account) has been babysitting my now 5 year old son since he was 1. I have never had any concern that she was anything less than great with the kids. When I had my now 8 month old daughter it was no question that both the kids would be going to the same babysitter. Over the past 8 months, Laura and I have gotten much closer than our previous babysitter/mom relationship and became best friends. Our husbands also became best friends and we all spent a lot of time together with my kids and her kids.

About six weeks ago my husband was picking our kids up and noticed our daughter was acting funny... pale in the face, staring, no facial reaction when he came in. He immediately brought her to me at work ( i work just down the street from the sitters) to get my opinion. I agreed that she wasn't acting normal and called the doctor's on call line. She had just got her vaccines two days prior and my initial thought was that it could be a bad reaction to something. The doctor said her behavior was concerning and to bring her to the ER. 

While there, Laura called me and immediately began crying saying that she had an accident and that she was carrying my daughter and another boy, about one year old, down the stairs at the same time and the one year old began messing her hair and face and she lost her grip on my daughter and dropped her down the stairs (this was right before my husband came to pick them up). She apologized profusely for not telling us right away but she was scared we would hate her and not want to be friends anymore etc etc. She said at first our daughter acted normal and then started to become more out of it closer to the time my husband went to pick them up. Initially, I was very angry. but I forgave her for not telling me right away, but ultimately decided  to pull the kids from her care. 

That night in the hospital, the doctor looked my daughter over, and said because there was no bruising and she was acting closer to her normal personality they didn't want to expose her to the radiation and sent us home without doing any xray or CT scans. Two days after this my daughter had a seizure and then went unconscious. After a CT scan, we find out she had internal bleeding in her head caused by the fall and we stayed at the hospital with her for the weekend.  


We THEN later find out that she also had bilateral retinal hemorrhaging  (via her discharge paperwork, the doctors for whatever reason didn't think it was necessary to share with her parents). This hemorrhaging is almost always seen with babies that have Shaken Baby Syndrome. It is possible to be seen with other cases of head trauma, but most often is a sign of abuse. Obviously CPS is involved and has been looking into the sitter. She has not once changed her story or made it seem like she was lying. But has more recently began to act very differently, especially towards my daughter.  But i am truly at a loss. I can't continue to be friends with someone who may have given my daughter Shaken Baby Syndrome but i have no way to know if she was lying unless she admits to it. It also puts my husband in a very difficult position because he is such close friends with her husband. If we still had a normal babysitter/ mom relationship this wouldn't even be an issue since the kids no longer go to her, but because we have gotten so close, cutting off all contact seems extreme if this really was just an accident.

My baby rolled over at 2.5 weeks and continued to do so until about 2 months. Now he's 3.5 months and will barely turn his head at tummy time.,Parenting,2,dgjyil,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dgjyil/my_baby_rolled_over_at_25_weeks_and_continued_to/,10,1570850734.0,"Hi everyone,

So like the title suggests, my baby had been rolling over during tummy time all on his own since he was tiny. I was pretty surprised after having read that it wasn't until 4 months that they usually start doing this..

My baby seems pretty strong in his neck, he has no problem holding it up on his own when he sits on the potty (he wouldn't poop in diapers so he goes on the potty multiple times a day), and he even jolly jumps and has pretty good neck control except when he gets tired, and even then it's not ""flopping"". He arches his back but only lifts his legs and gets mad when on his tummy. 

Maybe I haven't been doing enough tummy time since he's only up for so long and we've been doing other things to play instead (working on holding rattles now, or jolly jumping, or sitting in his exersaucer).

Any tips on how I can get him to start using those muscles during tummy time? Are his arms weak? Is it weird that he used to do it every time when he was only weeks old and now can't or is it just because he's a chubazoid now?

Thanks for all the advice!

Maybe I haven't been doing enough tummy time since he's only up for so long and we've been doing other things to play instead (working on holding rattles now, or jolly jumping, or sitting in his exersaucer).

Any tips on how I can get him to start using those muscles during tummy time? Are his arms weak? Is it weird that he used to do it every time when he was only weeks old and now can't or is it just because he's a chubazoid now?

Thanks for all the advice!

Tldr; looking for tips on how to get my baby to use his arms to lift his head and chest off the floor during tummy time, which he hates."

AUTISM PARENTING IS HARD. IT‚ÄôS OK TO SAY IT.,Parenting,205,dg1gcr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dg1gcr/autism_parenting_is_hard_its_ok_to_say_it/,53,1570757640.0,"Regardless of special needs or not, haven‚Äôt all parents said this at some point? Mine sure did! This isn‚Äôt some new revelation focusing solely on autism itself, but with the increasing number of children being diagnosed, it‚Äôs a reality for millions of parents. Parents who are reaching out for help and just trying their best to educate themselves.

Unless someone has walked a day in your shoes, he/ she has no right to tell you how to feel. Just like with any struggle you‚Äôre having, reaching out for help and admitting it is the first step to finding peace.

As of late, I have been puzzled by the recent controversy I‚Äôve been seeing on social media. More specifically,, within the social media online ‚Äúsupport groups‚Äù geared towards parents of children and adults with autism. I scroll through reading comments of desperate parents reaching out for help or just wanting to vent about how hard some days can be only to be met with parent shaming and criticism.

While thankfully there are supportive comments, as well as very supportive groups, there are still groups that have comments calling out these parents for admitting that it‚Äôs tough. The comments can be shocking and downright horrible, calling out parents and scolding them for sharing their feelings and going as far as to screenshot their posts and re-sharing them to other communities just to shame them. I‚Äôve personally been through this, and lucky for me, I‚Äôm almost 19 years in and have grown a thick skin. I can ignore it. However, there are many new parents who are emotionally fragile, isolated, and depressed. They already feel as though they are failing as parents, and these comments are only making them feel worse. Many people retreat, already questioning their parenting, and become even more depressed and too vulnerable to reach out.

It‚Äôs funny; parents of newborns will be the first to tell you that the sleep deprivation from waking at all hours of the night is tough. They have to deal with colic, reflux, formula, the diapers, the bottles, pack- ing diaper bags, strollers, pediatricians, the lack of sleep, and don‚Äôt forget the LAUNDRY!

As a parent of two young men on the spectrum (both born in the same year), I remember those days vividly, and while yes, it was a lot of work, I expected it, I knew what was coming. I listened to those stories and took notes, ‚Äúnap when the baby sleeps,‚Äù etc. Those stories helped me out! Taking care of two babies was exhausting, but I savored those days knowing they would be short-lived (or so I thought). With all the advice I had been given and continued to receive after their arrival, I felt prepared knowing that I could handle it and that this was the norm, and that eventually, life would become much easier.

By the age of two and three, both of my boys had been diagnosed with autism. I was on my own. My husband (at the time) was deployed to Iraq for over a year and would then be deployed for the next few years to Afghanistan and Korea. Given that I had only been in the US for a few years (I had moved to the US from Canada), I had made a few friends at work, but my social circle and support system was nonexistent.

Those years were the toughest years of my life. My boys didn‚Äôt sleep for the first eight years. Both were non-verbal, both had extreme sensory issues, and both eloped. My younger son was in diapers until the age of four and drank from a bottle until seven. The tantrums were daily and all through the night. My days had no beginning and no end. Going out was hard; restaurants were impossible unless we could drive through them. My eldest was progressing so fast it was as if his au- tism traits were disappearing. He began to realize his brothers‚Äô special needs and kept asking when his brother would talk or even play with him. He took on the role of protector, causing him to grow up much too fast. We were all overwhelmed.

Finally, I decided to stop worrying and just embrace it. You choose your mood, and we needed to be happy. 

Rather than being depressed about not going to restaurants, I looked on the bright side and got excited about getting takeout and enjoying it on the couch with a movie.

We stopped feeling sad just because my son doesn‚Äôt come out when we have people over or may not want to be a part of the party. He‚Äôs very happy in his room knowing that everyone is here and will come out and ask them to stay when they leave. It‚Äôs just the way he enjoys it. The repetitive behaviors and loud vocal tics are hard and take a toll, but similar to him having to adapt to the sound of the bathwater running, we have adapt- ed to this. I often tell myself that if it bothers me, imagine how he feels?







Going out is hard and requires a great deal of plan- ning, but I refuse to just stay home. How will he learn? What kind of life would that be? 

I want him to be used to this so he‚Äôs prepared as an adult. I have found that traveling brings out the best in him and it‚Äôs usually when I see the most progress. 

People asked me why I put myself through all this stress, but for me, it wasn‚Äôt an option. I have two kids. I never wanted autism to dictate our life and have his brother miss out on things and end up resentful. This life is exhausting and stressful, but it‚Äôs amazing the strength and patience you can have when having strength and patience is your only option. Over time I‚Äôve learned to follow his lead. A behavior that seems odd to me doesn‚Äôt always need correct- ing. It‚Äôs amazing when you open your mind and go with the flow; there is often a ‚Äúmethod to the mad- ness‚Äù and a perfectly reasonable explanation for that supposedly odd behavior...we just may not see it right away.","AUTISM PARENTING IS HARD.

He wets the bed almost every night. He's managed to go a few nights without incident, but never more than a week at a time.

I've mentioned it to his pediatrician, who assured us it is a common problem and not necessarily a symptom of an underlying illness. It's just frustrating at this point. Son is embarrassed that he still has to wear ""bedtime underwear"". He can't go to sleepovers because he's worried his friends will find out. If a friend comes to our house we have to make sure all the evidence is hidden away. It's so stressful for him and it breaks my heart.

I need to stress here, that we absolutely don't shame our son for his accidents. We know he's not doing it on purpose and have told him so. We limit drinks in the evening and use the bathroom multiple times before bed. Doesn't help. We've tried mattress pads under his sheets, thinking that if he feels the wet eventually his body will start waking up when he has the urge to go. Still nothing. We've woken him up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom. Still wet come morning.

I guess I'm not really looking for solutions, because I know this is an issue only time can solve. Just wondering how many of you have gone through a similar situation.

My son just turned 17 and is a junior in high school. He's going through a lot of that I think I'm adult but don't want responsibility thing that teens go through. As a freshman he wanted to go to Notre Dame, a real elite school. I think he quickly realized that probably wasn't gonna happen but he still wanted to go to college....then this year started. He signed up for CTC which is career technology center, it's basically a work training program for the morning at school. He had always told us he wanted to be a mechanical engineer....but he doesn't sign up for that program, he signs up for the auto mechanic program. He likes doing stuff with cars and all that so ok...  


6 weeks later after being an overachiever at school, he is failing classes, but not just failing, dramatically failing like a 17% in a class failing. He's in advanced prep for college classes and is not even trying, last night he told us he doesn't care about his grades and we shouldn't either because he's not going to college. This came about because we got an email he needed to sign up for a test to get college credit to which he said he didn't need that.  


Nothing against auto mechanics but it's super frustrating to watch him flush every goal to the point of not even caring about passing classes anymore because of 6 weeks of a auto tech class. I just don't really know what to do here, if he wants to be a mechanic I don't want to crap on him but I also feel like what he's doing is really not acceptable either. 

We've had some issues with him over the years where he is manipulative, thinks he's the smartest guy in the room.

TIFU by punishing my daughter even though she did what I wanted,Parenting,21,dg85wv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dg85wv/tifu_by_punishing_my_daughter_even_though_she_did/,9,1570787260.0,"(TLDR at the bottom)

I have a 3 year old daughter, and like most toddlers, has issues with listening.  She's not horrible by any means, but she's a toddler.  We've been getting a bit stricter about enforcing consequences for not listening i.e. usually if we do A then B then C and she won't listen and do B, then C doesn't happen.

So our normal bed time routine is PJ's, read 3 books while drinking a bit of milk, and then bed.  Lately we've been reading books in our room.  While I was getting her three month old brother (who decided to not sleep last night so I am functioning off of maybe 3 hours of sleep) ready for bed I asked her to go up to her room and get three books to read.  She didn't listen and climbed on the bed instead, so I again tell her to go get the books.  She goes up to her room to get them.  I'm trying to get her brother's PJs on and he's screaming and crying, and then I hear HER crying.  She comes down without books, and upset that her necklaces are all tangled up.  Today was one of those days where she was just being very emotional and crying over nothing, so by bed time it was getting on my nerves.

I calm her down and tell her again to go up and get her books.  While she goes to get the books I go to get a couple things from the kitchen.  I hear her crying again, and she comes to me and is crying because now she can't find a ring that she has, and she needs this, and she needs that... etc... etc...  Finally I get her back upstairs to our room and ask if she brought down the books.  All she brought down is a little fabric box with a bunch of her toys in it.

I had it.  That was it.  I asked her three times to get her @(\*@\*#\* books and she didn't do it. I just ran out of patience. So no books.  Straight to bed.   Of course, that caused a huge meltdown.  Got her in bed,  and she looks devastated.  I went into my room to pick up the box and as I do, the toys shift a bit and I can now see the darn books at the bottom of it.  She wanted to bring some toys down too so she had grabbed a box, put her books in it, and then some toys.  But I didn't see the books because the toys were in the way. F. Me.

Cue the guilty walk back up the stairs and a loooong apology.

The kicker:  We reset and do the normal bed time routine.  As I'm tucking her in she says ""wait wait.  I left my toys on the floor.  I need to pick them up.  I'm sorry I left them on the floor.  I shouldn't have done that.  I'm sorry""  she picked up her toys and went to bed.  I give her a hug & kiss and leave the room only to hear her politely calling for me again.  She wanted just ""one more hug and kiss because I love you"".  God darnit kid... you really know how to pull at my heart strings.

TLDR: I f'd up because I thought my daughter didn't get her bedtime books like I had repeatedly asked her to, so I sent her to bed without reading any, causing her to have a meltdown.  Only to later find out that she had in fact done what I had asked - I just hadn't noticed.  She then said some very sweet things that made me feel even more guilty than I already did.","TIFU by punishing my daughter even though she did what I wanted(TLDR at the bottom)

I just wanted to share something that might help out folks finding balance between becoming being a spouse and a parent. I have to admit what might work for my family may not work for your.
My wife and I have one daughter (16f) and one son (14m). 

Our family takes always three trips a year of 4-5 days. However the twist we don't go  as a family. First trip wifey and I take our kids on separate vacations with one parent and one kid starting around the same time. Next trip we switch kids. The third and final trip is a couples only trip usually for our anniversary. Yes we do family vacations but once every two years.

We've doing this ever since they were five years old and it was worth it. Around the time we realized we as parents we do alot of things with our kids but we don't ""actually spend time with him"". Doing homework with them or taking them to soccer practice isn't spending time with him as going through our daily routines. I connect much more when we are playing SMASH BROS and talking about life than doing anyone of those things previously mentioned. I also connect with my daughter when I taking her out for lunch. My wife has got their own thing going with them. By finding common ground with our kids we found being parent was less of a burden and more of a relationship. We also do little to make them feel inclusive like if they like our clothes what music are the listening to.

We have also seen so many positives outcomes of this. Both kids are straight A students because they feel more comfortable asking us for help when it comes to tutoring or further practice. They also put more work in their academics because of they have faith in us in not punishing them frequently but pushing them foward. They are well mannered and very compassionate. They both respect we aren't just parent but many other  thing. They respect when we make time for ourselves or with someone because we value time with them. They are less argumentative and are willing to discuss thing if we have opposing points. They help out in the house.

The point I'm making is that don't make parenting be all about the daily chores that comes with being a parent. Find a connection with each child so that when they hear how you unconditionally love them.

Nanny and Parent clash??,Parenting,0,dgfsf3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dgfsf3/nanny_and_parent_clash/,29,1570832082.0,"I am needing advice. 
So I am a 20y old female who has worked with and been around kids my entire life. I have my preschool education degree and have almost completed my special education degree as well. I taught in a preschool for three years and have seen nearly every type of behavior and child. When I was 14 I had basically raised my younger brother and my mother had a new baby. Fast forward to now I basically raised this younger younger brother as well. I have babysat and nannied since I can remember. 

I currently have this nanny position and I am struggling just a little bit on what to do. 

I have worked for this family for about 5 months now and this issue is becoming more difficult to deal with. They have 2 kids- 3year old boy  and a 1year old girl. The 3 year old had water in his ears until 1.5 yrs old so his speech is delayed- but he goes to ‚Äúschool‚Äù and works with speech therapists, so it is being worked on (he is making GREAT progress). 

Now, let me make it clear that I fully understand the stage that the 3 year old is in. He is into saying ‚Äòno‚Äô and having tantrums. I understand that is just him being a kid. 

But I arrive at 7:30 each morning. Usually he has been up since 3:30-4:00 a.m., watching TV playing the iPad when I get there. His parents are not authoritative at all. Just this morning he began to have a tantrum when his mother took the iPad away to serve breakfast. He was screaming, hitting her, spitting on her, throwing himself on the floor, the whole deal. She just let him do it. After about 20 minutes she got tired of it and took him to his room. But she stayed in there with him and bribed him to stop crying with candy and iPad time. Which is NOT AT ALL what should be done. She lets him act like that and it makes my insides burn when she is around and he acts like that. Note: he DOES NOT act like that for me. I truly feel like they as parents are push overs and do not discipline him enough. 

What do I do????

 I don‚Äôt step in when she is here because I feel that is crossing a boundary and overall, she is the parent. But I can no longer sit back and watch her and her husband allow him to act like that and then reward him just so he is quiet. 

Any serious advice will be greatly appreciated. I am at a loss on what to do.

EDIT: I want to add that this behavior is not all the time. 70% of the time he is the sweetest, silliest, most loving child I have met. I wrote this post after about 5-6 tantrums he has has the last 2 weeks with her home.","Nanny and Parent clash??I am needing advice.

Now, she's at that 6 month mark where doctors say you can (and should) start sleep training. I get nothing done, hardly any cleaning and any freetime is spent on school work...which isn't much. In short, I need her to sleep on her own so I can get daily life stuff done.

I cant read my baby's mind, but if I felt that way there's a good chance she's feeling the same way but has no way to express herself or tell me.  This is what makes me question post partum because I'll do anything to just keep her happy even though I'm a complete mess and barely holding myself together.

I've had plenty advice from people who put their baby down from day one.  I'm looking for advice from those who can relate.  I know its unhealthy for my baby and myself to be so depend on each other.

So my wife (31) and I (M31) live in my hometown in Indiana with our two kids (6, 8). We lived in Alabama for a time, which is where both of our kids were born, then we moved to Ecuador when they were 1 & 3, then to Indiana when they were 3 & 5, so they‚Äôre no strangers to moving. My parents And two of my siblings live in my hometown, but I have 3 more siblings, as well as all of my nieces (3) and my nephew in (southern) California. Should we relocate? 

My hometown (>30k people)  has very few job opportunities, and I would need to drive easily 40 miles to a city big enough for a significant amount of job opportunities (as well as variety). The public schools are...typically bad. I‚Äôve been personally connected to two people that overdosed on meth, this year alone. The weather for ~6 months of the year is very miserable and depressing. Our town is rundown and there are few opportunities for entertainment (like, we have a movie theater and once a year we have an antique car show and once a year we have a War of 1812 festival...that‚Äôs it). However, housing here is very cheap, like some of the cheapest in the nation (my nice house in a nice part of town for 2000sq ft is ~$80k). My parents And two siblings that are here are only kind of helpful as far as babysitters go.

In SoCal, I know the price of housing is ridiculous and I would likely have a long commute as well. However, it seems like there a opportunities for education, employment and entertainment like nowhere else. You‚Äôre also near the ocean, mountains and desert. We‚Äôd be starting over as we have a network here but only a very tiny one out there.

Hmmmm. A list of things I should not have to lecture my brilliant, wonderful, teenaged children about:
1. Brush your teeth.
2. Wash up. In fact, general hygiene. If you have not bathed in a couple of days, your hair will look nappy and people will justifiably criticize you. Take a shower.
3. You do not have a maid because your father is not a wall street tycoon. Wash your own clothes at lest once a week if no angel has done it for you. You are not mentally deficient. Read a tag and do laundry.  If the pile of clothes is spilling from the hamper, or your nasty butt does not use a hamper, you've already gone too long. Do a load now. No phone, no games, no TV or YouTube. Do. Your. Laundry.
4. Clean up after yourself AND OTHERS. Dishes on the table? Stuff on the floor? Looks like a bomb struck East Providence? Pick it up, return it to its rightful place, tidy it / wash it, and put it away? Not yours? Who cares!? Do it! This world gets better when we do more than just look after ourselves. Be part of a better world!
5. Time to get Biblical: HONOR THY FATHER AND MOTHER. Your moms is at her goddamn breaking point. Do you love her? Do you want her going to FB and Insta saying how beat up she is? THEN STOP ACTING LIKE SELFISH LITTLE SAVAGES, SWALLOW YOUR TEENAGED LAZY REBELLION, AND REMEMBER THAT YOU OWE HER RESPECT. Please, I LOVE my kiddos. Honor that by being good and help a mom out, okay?

Girlfriend's child is extremely difficult. Have to pick up at school all the time. What can we do?,Parenting,20,dg3gwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dg3gwd/girlfriends_child_is_extremely_difficult_have_to/,21,1570765771.0,"I've been with my girlfriend for about a year. She has two children, one is 7 the other is 6. Let's call the 7 year old Billy.

Billy likes to be violent. He loves not listening and doing whatever he wants to do. He has a very hard time keeping his hands off of people and treats his teachers with complete disrespect to the point of possible harm.

I've tried working with him in every way I can think how. He's currently on 4 medications because of this. Now before I get anyone commenting about over medicating, if he's not on the medicine he's 1,000 times worse. To the point of being uncontrollable at home.

When he's at home and I'm there, he's usually fine. When I'm not there he does the same stuff to his mother that he does at school. His mother is a very non-disciplinarian when it comes to her kids. She was brought up in a home where violence was commonplace, she hates to discipline her children but will do it if the event is extreme. I've tried to help her become stronger when it comes to her children, but this usually ends in a fight about her skills as a parent.

When we discipline we do not spank, we only talk to take things away. He has a corner he sits in when he's bad. 

He has a child psychiatrist that he goes to every couple of weeks. But when he's there he does none of these things. He also does not respond truthfully. He lies constantly there and at home. We've shown the psychiatrist the reports from school to which he stated we should start involving religion. We are not religious people and do not believe this will help in any way as he wouldn't care one way or the other.

We're at a loss as to what to do anymore. The school calls us daily because he's being terrible to other students or staff. When we get on the phone with him he usually calms down the rest of the day. But, sometimes we have to go pick him up. It's to the point where our jobs are at stake because of it. We do not have the money to put him in martial arts or sports as I believe that would help the situation.

We've read every article, every book on difficult kids and all of the suggestions are the same. Talk to him, make things he can get if he's good, put up a chart for days he's bad/good, etc. None of this works. Talking to him does nothing. He says he understands but then goes right back to being violent and/or angry. 

His biological father had some major issues with violence. He went to jail because he beat up my girlfriend with Billy in the room. I believe genetics and/or seeing this has something to do with the problem.

We're out of options. We have no idea what we can do. We cannot survive if we're leaving work every single day to go and get him. The school has him in special ed, but the teachers at this new school cannot control him. 

My girlfriend and I's relationship is very strained because of this. I care for both her kids and I want them to succeed. But at this point I'm completely out of ideas.

If anyone has any advice, I'm all ears. Thank you.","Girlfriend's child is extremely difficult. Have to pick up at school all the time. What can we do?I've been with my girlfriend for about a year. She has two children, one is 7 the other is 6. Let's call the 7 year old Billy.

Billy likes to be violent. He loves not listening and doing whatever he wants to do. He has a very hard time keeping his hands off of people and treats his teachers with complete disrespect to the point of possible harm.

I've tried working with him in every way I can think how. He's currently on 4 medications because of this. Now before I get anyone commenting about over medicating, if he's not on the medicine he's 1,000 times worse. To the point of being uncontrollable at home.

When he's at home and I'm there, he's usually fine. When I'm not there he does the same stuff to his mother that he does at school. His mother is a very non-disciplinarian when it comes to her kids. She was brought up in a home where violence was commonplace, she hates to discipline her children but will do it if the event is extreme. I've tried to help her become stronger when it comes to her children, but this usually ends in a fight about her skills as a parent.

When we discipline we do not spank, we only talk to take things away. He has a corner he sits in when he's bad. 

He has a child psychiatrist that he goes to every couple of weeks. But when he's there he does none of these things. He also does not respond truthfully. He lies constantly there and at home. We've shown the psychiatrist the reports from school to which he stated we should start involving religion. We are not religious people and do not believe this will help in any way as he wouldn't care one way or the other.

We're at a loss as to what to do anymore. The school calls us daily because he's being terrible to other students or staff. When we get on the phone with him he usually calms down the rest of the day. But, sometimes we have to go pick him up. It's to the point where our jobs are at stake because of it. We do not have the money to put him in martial arts or sports as I believe that would help the situation.

We've read every article, every book on difficult kids and all of the suggestions are the same. Talk to him, make things he can get if he's good, put up a chart for days he's bad/good, etc. None of this works. Talking to him does nothing. He says he understands but then goes right back to being violent and/or angry. 

His biological father had some major issues with violence. He went to jail because he beat up my girlfriend with Billy in the room. I believe genetics and/or seeing this has something to do with the problem.

We're out of options. We have no idea what we can do. We cannot survive if we're leaving work every single day to go and get him. The school has him in special ed, but the teachers at this new school cannot control him. 

My girlfriend and I's relationship is very strained because of this. I care for both her kids and I want them to succeed. But at this point I'm completely out of ideas.

If anyone has any advice, I'm all ears. Thank you."
Speech problem with 9 yr old,Parenting,2,dgbzg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dgbzg0/speech_problem_with_9_yr_old/,10,1570810121.0,"My (49M) youngest son (9M) has problems with speech. At least, that's what I think.

He has had several issues ever since he started speaking.

He doesn't pronounce words the way they should be. He speaks either too softly, too loud or too fast. He even sometimes makes up his own words for things.

He has an older brother and sister. Since he started speaking, nobody has had trouble understanding him. Everyone knew what he meant and never tried to correct him. Except me.

Me and his mom took him to a speech therapist and she worked a miracle. His speech greatly improved. It's also not a dental problem.

The issue I'm dealing with is this: somehow nobody seems to care about his speech! No matter what he says, he knows we understand him, so he really doesn't put in any effort to continue his new way of speaking and he's back to where he was, sometimes even worst. It's not normal to have a conversation with a 9 yr old and really have to concentrate to be able to understand him.

I know he's young, but he's about to reach that age where kids are going to judge him by it and/or make fun of him. Kids can be cruel. I also don't want him to lose his confidence. It worries me that the longer he keeps this up, the harder it will be to retrain his speech mechanisms. He's a great kid and deserves a great life.

I feel so alone in my effort to help him. His teacher doesn't see the problem, his class mates don't, his siblings don't, my ex doesn't. Only me and sometimes it makes me feel like the asshole.

I try to help him by asking him to slow down, speak up, speak more clearly, etc. All in a very respectful and relaxed way. I don't want to make this a huge issue for him.

Having a tough time with the baby,Parenting,34,dfxkia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dfxkia/having_a_tough_time_with_the_baby/,26,1570740703.0,"Stay-at-home dad of two girls, 2.5 and 6mo.

Our oldest had a feeding aversion that got bad enough she had to get a feeding tube. She eats good now, but her doctors still make us use the tube to build up her weight. We might have it out by the time she is 3 though.

Youngest is a much better eater, but still nothing near what other parents talk about. She is like 30th percentile, which is fine, but we'd love her to be higher.

Both kids were fed expressed breast milk in Dr. Brown bottles, as per the recommendation of every doctor we've ever seen. In addition to working an insanely demanding job, my wife sacrifices much of her sleep and time with the kids pumping.

When I'm out in public, and I see someone with a baby, and then they whip out a bottle and just hold it in the general direction of the baby's face, and the baby just guzzles the whole thing down in a minute or two....I want to strangle someone. I get so irrationally angry.

Neither of our kids would touch a bottle in public. If they weren't swaddled, in their room, in the dark, rocking, being held a very specific way, with the bottle pointed at just the perfect angle, they wouldn't eat. And our oldest still wouldn't eat enough even then. Both of them would thrash their heads side to side, trying to get away from the bottle.

What makes me even angrier is when I see other parents making posts like this one, worrying that their kid isn't eating enough. Because it's almost always like "" I'm so worried! Our baby only ate 48 oz of milk today, instead of her normal 64! What am I going to do!!!!"" Or ""Our toddler hasn't been eating well. This morning she only hat two porterhouse steaks, a baked potato and a gallon of milk!"" Man, I had days where our oldest at 7 oz of milk the whole day. And even when she was getting some solids, 1 tsp of baby food per meal was a hard-fought victory. We'll see how our youngest does with solids. She's about ready.

Nothing is medically wrong with either of them. Keep your suggestions to yourself. We've tried everything. If I get another suggestion, I might explode.

Anyway, our oldest eats great now, like I said. She has healthier eating habits than any toddler I know. She loves olives, cottage cheese, pecans, pasta, taco meat, so many other things. She eats some things even adults are picky about. If it were up to me, we'd quit using the tube immediately, because that Boost formula suppresses hunger. It's not supposed to, but it does. She eats better without it. But the doctors won't let us. So we're just staying the course a little while longer.

Our youngest is better than her older sister. By a mile. And I count my blessings every day for that. Most days she's cooperative. Some days, she's just impossible. Some days she will eat in her rocker, which I wouldn't do, but she HATES to be held, unless she's in the swaddle, in her room, in the dark, etc. I can't just feed her anywhere in the house, like a normal parent. And I always have to make sure to time our outings around her feedings, because she will not eat in public, and if she misses a whole feeding, there goes the whole day.

This is just a vent. I don't need anything. We'll keep pushing, and we'll get there. If we could survive our oldest, we'll survive this one.

But I don't know if I will ever get over the anger I have when I see another parent calmly and easily feeding their child. And even the thousands of parents and children who have it much, much worse than us, at least they have a diagnosis they understand! At least there's an explanation. Not so with us.

I know we're not literally the only people who have kids that refuse to eat for no good reason. But it definitely feels like a very small group of us. And there's really no help. Just keep the kid clinging to life by their fingernails, and one day they'll just grow out of it. The end.

"One, 18 month old kid and I can't seem to handle it. Is it me?",Parenting,3,dg7upd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dg7upd/one_18_month_old_kid_and_i_cant_seem_to_handle_it/,22,1570785734.0,"Let me preface this by saying that I'm relatively priviliged and lucky. I don't want this to be a big whine, but I'd really appreciate some third party perspective on where I'm at and how I'm feeling.

My partner and I have a one kid. He's about 18 months old and I think fairly normal? He runs around a lot, gets into trouble, etc. He's in a throwing phase right now so that's fun. But he's a toddler, I'm pretty sure this comes with the territory.

I am absolutely freaking exhausted the last few weeks. To the point where as soon as the kid is in bed, I get ready for bed too. He sleeps well most of the time, going to bed between 8 and 9pm, and waking up anywhere from 6 to 8. Even when I get a full 8 hours, I am exhausted when I get up, and exhausted at the end of the day. I am less exhausted while working, possibly due to coffee, or maybe just that I have some relative alone time.

Both by partner and I work from home. I work ~40h/week, they work ~20h/week. Our kid doesn't go to daycare, but we have grandparents come a couple of times a week to help out (which sometimes ends up not being super helpful, as our kid is still pretty clingy).

Our weekdays go like this:

* Get up with kiddo between 6 and 8
* Coffee, kiddo play time while I make breakfast
* Feed kiddo
* Clean up after kiddo
* Hand off to partner and get to work
* Work until lunch, then help feed and clean kiddo
* Work until done, take over from partner while they work
* Dinner (usually leftovers/meal prep), clean up after kiddo
* Play time, if time, bath, kiddo bed time (between 8 and 9pm). Partner is working until kiddo bed time
* I usually handle overnight wakeups, which are rare at this point (yay!)

Weekends I'm usually primary parent for the most part. Partner's parents often come for a few hours one day, which I use to clean or do some other minor house task.

Repeat forever.

It's been this way for months now and I am absolutely running out of energy. I have very limited time to myself, and have to stop attending a class I used to go to because kiddo's bed time runs right over it.

I certainly knew life would change a lot with a kid, but this is more than I possibly imagined - pretty much no part of my life before our kid was born has remained at this point, unless you count work.

I guess what I really want to know is: Is this normal?","One, 18 month old kid and I can't seem to handle it. Is it me?Let me preface this by saying that I'm relatively priviliged and lucky.

Problems with School,Parenting,2,dg92gj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dg92gj/problems_with_school/,0,1570791810.0,"Hey everyone - back again. I don't have a link for my previous post. The issues that we were having with my six year old have mostly resolved, I'm happy to say. 

Here's what's going on now: 
My six year old son is very social and likes to talk. We're working with him on not talking out of turn and not talking while his teacher talks. She's moved his seat, but the kid has never met a stranger and will happily make friends with anyone. He hasn't come up for air since he learned how to talk. 

Since he started kindergarten, I've been really side-eyeing how they do things (I do have a degree in education, so I'm not completely uninformed). He mostly has good days where his ""clip"" isn't moved at all - or is moved once at most. However, he's had a rough few days this week. His teacher has kept him out of PE several times for talking too much in class, which I feel is extremely counterintuitive considering it's really the only time of day these kids get to be physically active and burn off some energy. Outside of PE, they have 30 minutes allotted for recess which is folded into nap time, and if they take too long to eat their snacls (right before recess which also has me asking questions), then they lose time at recess. 

I've spoken to the teacher regarding my concerns about this. I teach his Sunday school class, and between that and having him at home, we've noticed that he does a better job of listening, staying quiet, and following directions when he's had time to go run around and expend some energy. Still, though, she takes PE away and things get worse throughout the day (shocking, I know). 

Today, his clip was moved twice for excessive talking. He and two other boys in his class were sent to see the principal who told them that if he heard them getting in trouble for this again, that he would ""bring the paddle"". Now, I'm in Alabama. I was raised in Texas. I knew that some places still had corporal punishment, but in every school district I've worked in, parents were required to opt into that if that's a discipline option that they're ok with. My husbamd and I are 100% not ok with this (especially used as a punishment for talking). What's worse is that one of our friends is a police officer and he warned us this afternoon as we were talking to him and his wife that in Alabama, they can paddle once without parental permission. 

At no point during the year have we gotten a phone call or text expressing concern. We just get a note on the back of his folder that says how many times his clip was moved and the reason. Today is said ""talk to principal"" with his transgressions listed (excessive talking) and no other information. We've spoken to the teacher numerous times, and we're still dealing with the same issues and have the same concerns. Now I'm concerned that since the principal is telling kids that they're going to be paddled for talking too much that this is a top down problem that likely won't be resolved by moving to another classroom. 

That said, we're very seriously considering taking him out and homeschooling for the remainder of the year until we move in May. Thoughts?

My 2nd son was born August 27th. He was a scheduled c section at 38 weeks due to my pregnancy induced hypertension (blood pressure was 160/110 so drs didn‚Äôt want to wait.) 
We had no indication that he wouldn‚Äôt be fine, but he wasn‚Äôt fine. He was grunting after being born, so they took him to the NICU thinking that he‚Äôd be there on oxygen for a night then back down with us.
His condition deteriorated quickly. 
Long story short, he had severe respiratory distress and a surfactant deficiency. He ended up with a large pneumothorax (hole in his lung and escaped air) which was causing his heart to stop beating. He had 2 needle excisions of air and ended up having a chest tube placed to pull the air out. He was on a ventilator for about a week. He had an umbilical line into his heart to monitor blood gas. He was tpn fed and sedated on fentanyl. He went through withdrawal at about a week old. Once he was extubated he was on oxygen for a while. He was remarkably only in the NICU for 12 days. 
Now he‚Äôs healthy and doctors say that his sickness at birth is over. It won‚Äôt affect him. He‚Äôs as healthy as any baby and we‚Äôll never know that he had such a rough start.
Problem is, logically I know this, but I‚Äôm terrified. I‚Äôm terrified that he‚Äôs not ok. I keep having flashbacks to him almost dying. To watching him on life support. To all the alarms. I don‚Äôt know who to talk to. I‚Äôm sad and I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôm having panic attacks. 
My husband thinks that because he‚Äôs fine now, I can just forget what happened. I can‚Äôt.

But I‚Äôm just not grasping this, that he‚Äôs fine.

I sometimes panic so much that I drink and feed my son a bottle, but many times this ends up with me worse than I was.

My son would have been 10 today. I miss him as much today as the day I lost him.,Parenting,2567,dffpna,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dffpna/my_son_would_have_been_10_today_i_miss_him_as/,15,1570649549.0,"(Sorry for dragging the subreddit through my healing process.)

A decade ago in a world that seems so far away, my son Aiden was born with a rare version of a rare Congenital Heart Defect called Unbalanced Atrioventricular Septal Defect (Unbalanced > AVSD > CHD). Despite the best efforts of a world renowned pediatric cardiovascular team of surgeons, doctors & nurses, he died hours after a hybrid Fontan surgery in the CICU as I watched, unable to do anything. 

Words do no justice at describing the pain, sadness, anger and mixture of other emotions that come with losing your child. No amount of friends, family or well wishes make it any better. For years following his death, I spiraled deeper and deeper into depression and alcohol addiction, which was my way of numbing the intense feelings I had every single day.

Within 6 months of his death I'd lost everything. Not only my son, but my career, my house, my cars, my savings, friends, family and my marriage. I was homeless and for a while, unsuccessfully tried drinking myself to death. Historically today, and October 23rd (the day he died), I was always at my worst. Drinking more (if that's possible), caring less, etc.

For almost 5 years, I had no empathy for anyone or anything. I emotionally hurt, took advantage, manipulated, lied and stole from people, being drunk 90% of the time and blacked out the other 10. Important to note that prior to his death I didn't drink or behave at all like this. I'm lucky I didn't kill anyone for having drove intoxicated so many times before I got a DUI. Luckily for me, I actually stayed off the road after that. 

Around my lowest point, I was approached by a man who served me with child support paperwork. Turned out that a year prior, a night of promiscuousness with a woman at a bar I met ended up in pregnancy and I was never told. In complete shock, I stopped drinking long enough to power on a laptop and run some backgrounds. Turns out I fathered a child with a convicted child abuser (multiple times even -- with bodily injury). 

All I could think about was a promise I made before my son died that I would protect him from anything for as long as I had breath. I reeled myself off the edge, slowed the drinking, got a software engineering position & started studying family law. In  6 months I was stable enough, had established enough of a relationship with my son and had collected enough evidence that directly related to my son to reasonably file for custody myself (no attorney).

I kept working on myself, quit drinking entirely and had met a woman through a support group who was recovering from the death of her first born daughter from a similar heart defect as my son. While I wasn't looking (at all) for a relationship, the connection I had with this person who went through something as terrible as I was something I couldn't ignore. 

Within a years time I was awarded sole physical and legal custody of my son (he was a little over a year old at the time) and I'd  started dating the woman who lost her 1st daughter. Turns out she has a daughter now too, 5 months younger than my son. 

Today, we're married and in addition to having a son of our own, we've legally adopted each other's children. We've both done a ton of work on ourselves to process and cope with the death of our 1st born in healthy ways. It is not easy. Even today, many years sober with no relapse, when I think about him, I choke up and hold back tears. 

After 10 years I've convinced myself that had my son lived his quality of life would have been awful. I've also convinced myself that even if I relived the moment 100 times, no decision I made would have resulted in a different outcome. (I was moving to having him flown to the East Coast to have an operation with a mitral valve specialist & the worlds #1 cardio surgeon but he had a heart attack before the flight and I opted for surgery in Denver). Even so, when I come across something about an advancement in leaky mitral valves being repaired with higher success rates, it's bittersweet. 

No matter how much I love my 3 living kiddos and all that we do together (which is a lot), I will always have a missing piece of my heart. What I'm sad about the most is the life I wasn't able to give my son and that he never got to understand how much I love him. I base my parenting off of that fact though and not a day goes by where I don't show & tell my kiddos how much I love them. Life can be here one moment and gone the next. 

\[Pic: [Me & Aiden, October 9th 2009](https://i.imgur.com/mJaYoWS.jpg)\]","My son would have been 10 today. I miss him as much today as the day I lost him.(Sorry for dragging the subreddit through my healing process.)

A decade ago in a world that seems so far away, my son Aiden was born with a rare version of a rare Congenital Heart Defect called Unbalanced Atrioventricular Septal Defect (Unbalanced > AVSD > CHD). Despite the best efforts of a world renowned pediatric cardiovascular team of surgeons, doctors & nurses, he died hours after a hybrid Fontan surgery in the CICU as I watched, unable to do anything. 

Words do no justice at describing the pain, sadness, anger and mixture of other emotions that come with losing your child. No amount of friends, family or well wishes make it any better. For years following his death, I spiraled deeper and deeper into depression and alcohol addiction, which was my way of numbing the intense feelings I had every single day.

Within 6 months of his death I'd lost everything. Not only my son, but my career, my house, my cars, my savings, friends, family and my marriage. I was homeless and for a while, unsuccessfully tried drinking myself to death. Historically today, and October 23rd (the day he died), I was always at my worst. Drinking more (if that's possible), caring less, etc.

For almost 5 years, I had no empathy for anyone or anything. I emotionally hurt, took advantage, manipulated, lied and stole from people, being drunk 90% of the time and blacked out the other 10. Important to note that prior to his death I didn't drink or behave at all like this. I'm lucky I didn't kill anyone for having drove intoxicated so many times before I got a DUI. Luckily for me, I actually stayed off the road after that. 

Around my lowest point, I was approached by a man who served me with child support paperwork. Turned out that a year prior, a night of promiscuousness with a woman at a bar I met ended up in pregnancy and I was never told. In complete shock, I stopped drinking long enough to power on a laptop and run some backgrounds. Turns out I fathered a child with a convicted child abuser (multiple times even -- with bodily injury). 

All I could think about was a promise I made before my son died that I would protect him from anything for as long as I had breath. I reeled myself off the edge, slowed the drinking, got a software engineering position & started studying family law. In  6 months I was stable enough, had established enough of a relationship with my son and had collected enough evidence that directly related to my son to reasonably file for custody myself (no attorney).

Trying to figure out how to deal with relationship with my Brother concerning my kids.,Parenting,14,dfyu3v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dfyu3v/trying_to_figure_out_how_to_deal_with/,9,1570746666.0,"I (35m) have two kids 3M and 6mo M. My older brother (39M) recently as in 2 weeks ago just had a child. My brother is a perennial fuckup. He's been a drug addict since he was probably 16 or 17. He's been in and out of jail all over the country for the last 15 years. He recently married a girl whom I knew growing up. She has 2 kids from 2 fathers and this baby is now the 3rd from a 3rd father. The first 2 kids are in the care of her parents. Currently they do live on their own, but I do know what the were fairly recently living with my parents.

Currently Im pretty much no contact with him as I do not agree with the way he mooches off my parents and I believe lies to them about the state of his sobriety. I don't have any proof he still uses but he's lost the benefit of the doubt with me.

My sons have never met their uncle and I intend to keep it that way until I know he's cleaned up and is living a semi-normal life. But now they have a cousin, who's done nothing wrong and has been born into, what I believe to be a pretty bad situation. My oldest loves his only other cousin, from my wife's side,  whom he gets to see about 5-6 times a year and he talks about her constantly. I don't want to deprive him and my youngest of having a relationship with another cousin, but I don't want them exposed to my brother. And honestly I don't want to deprive myself of a relationship with my new niece.

Another wrinkle in this whole deal is that I have sinking feeling this child is either going to end with her parents, or my parents. Her parents are ok but also not the kind of people I would want raising kids. My parents are great, successful people who have tried their entire lives and spent probably 10s of thousands of dollars over the years to help my brother. But they are almost 70 and I don't think they have the kind of energy to raise a child.

I cried (away, of course lol Im sooo tired.) but as soon as we lef,t she tossed it all, and is on the floor now, sleeping.

My son is 7 and in second grade. 

The basic issues are this. The administration consistently tells students not to tattle, so my child never feels comfortable asking for help when he needs it. He gets bullied or pestered with no one intervening, then finally snaps and is punished for it. Then to top it off, other children tattle and he‚Äôs punished for whatever stupid little thing he‚Äôs ratted out for. Their idea of a good consequence is in school suspension where he sits in the office alone all day. Great way to teach a lesson. 

I‚Äôm at the end of my rope. I can‚Äôt stand another day of my baby coming home in tears. Or crying when trying to tell me what happened at school that day. I feel like the adults are being lazy and have no empathy for the children. It‚Äôs more important to them to be left alone and not be bothered than it is to take a stand against bullying and make school a safe place for the students. 

If you want specific examples I will add an edit. I left them out for fear of going on a total rant.","My son is having a terrible time in school again this year.

6 year old son made a sarcastic comment in class yesterday,Parenting,7,dfzmvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dfzmvk/6_year_old_son_made_a_sarcastic_comment_in_class/,15,1570750016.0,"My 6 year old son has high-functioning autism and some severe speech, communication, and social delays. He was nonverbal until he was 3 (although he could communicate using sign language before that). To this day, his communication skills are very delayed. He is unable to express his own original thoughts and cannot apply social skills to new and unfamiliar situations, and becomes disregulated when faced with this kind of situation. Because of this, he communicates entirely through scripts and is only able to say something if he hears someone say a similar comment immediately beforehand.

My son is in a classroom for delayed children (although most of the children have primarily academic delays, which he has no problem with). Yesterday, his teacher made a sarcastic comment to the classroom aide in a voice the children could hear. My son enjoyed the presentation of this comment, so, using scripts, he pasted together his own sarcastic comment about another student in the classroom. For the record, we have never used sarcasm at home in front of him, so this was entirely new for him. The teachers were so shocked by his mature use of sarcasm that they suspended him for two days. I think this suspension is very unjustified because, first, he has never had behavior problems like defiance and bullying. Second, he didn't know that sarcasm can be hurtful, since he has never seen sarcasm before and was only scripting. However, the school wouldn't have any of this and insisted that it was due to a behavior problem, which I (and my son's therapists) know it isn't. What should I do?

I've tried talking to him. Reasoning with him, taking toys away, promising toys if he behaves.

So I was originally thinking this is a phase and that he will grow out of it, but it‚Äôs been about a year and is showing no signs of stopping. When I tell him to get his hands out of there he just looks at me with the cutest little face and giggles and then the hands go right back.

He is too young to understand that he should only do this in private and I don‚Äôt want to give him some kind of complex about his penis. 

The other problem is that when trying to get to it he frequently takes off his diaper, he pees in restaurants and other public places and all over the house (hence the new pajama policy).

What do I do? do I go ahead and try to potty train him so at least he isn‚Äôt peeing everywhere? What do I do about preschool next year?

What to do with a 1st grader who might have a special aptitude for something (math) but has no interest in pursuing it?,Parenting,10,dfxf7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dfxf7i/what_to_do_with_a_1st_grader_who_might_have_a/,16,1570739961.0,"Basically the jist of my problem is what do I do if I want to guide my child through her journey of self-discovery - help her know what she's good at and what she wants to do - but at the same time not wanting to thrust her into anything excessively that she may genuinely not want to do?


See my kid is a 1st grader and in her school, they are given aptitude tests for various subjects. It turns out that after taking those tests, the faculty has determined that she has a knack for doing math. So they want to include her in a special program for advanced math that would eventually be parlayed into math competitions where she is part of a team that represents the school.


The problem is that my kid has no interest. She doesn't *hate* math, but, I mean... she's in first grade. In her spare time, she wants to play and watch stuff, not study anything more than what she needs to.


How to go about this? Because forcing her any more than our current level of encouragement doesn't feel right. I'm thinking of trying to talk her into a deal where she focuses on the math stuff for this year - try as hard as she genuinely can and see what comes of it - then if she really doesn't like it, then we won't push her in that direction any more.

How do you sustain encouragement in this situation if she keeps saying that she doesn't want to join. She just wants to do normal math. She can't do the advanced math.

School called us out to talk about our child (7/M) behavior on Monday; it doesn't look good,Parenting,1,dg7mnb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dg7mnb/school_called_us_out_to_talk_about_our_child_7m/,11,1570784629.0,"First some background: last summer we decided that our seven-years-old boy was not going back to the public school he was assigned to for various reasons; overcrowded, he wasn't learning much and he was constantly scare of a pack of bullies that apparently the school could do nothing about.   He was really unhappy and told us about it and luckily we got a spot for him in a local private school.

The first couple of weeks didn't go really well, as he was called out a couple of times for misbehavior and play-fighting; that was really bad for us, but more for his mom who was afraid that he was going to be spelled.  We had a meeting with the school counselor and explained our son background and the issues he had at his last school and pleaded with them for patience and to give us some time for him to adjust.

We had serious conversation with our kid and made him understand that if he liked the new school (he did) he had to do something about that; we basically spent half a weekend talking and explaining the situation to him and he seemed to get it.  For the last few weeks he was the model student, doing all his assignments and following the teachers instructions.  However, today he had a ""relapse"" to his bad boy behavior that involved throwing some object that ended up  hitting another kid after being told specifically not to do that.

My understanding (given that I was told all this by his mom) is that they spoke with him and told him that this was unacceptable, but he ended up the rest of the school activities without any more incidents.  They also told us that they want to talk to us on Monday on a meeting with the teacher, two counselor and the school director to discuss ""what's going to happen next"".  

I fear the worst, that they're going to kick our kid out of school as they've been very adamant that physical contact of any kind with other students is ground for expulsion.  I understand their situation, they have a reputation to uphold and they are very strict when it comes to unruly students who put the safety of others at risk even if not intentional.

I really don't know how to approach this with them as they already gave us an opportunity and our kid seemed to be doing so well until today.  I of course will speak on behalf of my son; his mom (we separated a few years ago) if more combative and already told me that she will let me do most of the talking as she's afraid that she might become very emotional advocating for our child.   

I really need any advice that you can give me about this; like I said, until today the kid was doing really well and I'm not saying that the school is very strict (my ex seems to thing so) but is it reasonable for us to ask them for a litter more time given the issues he had at his last school?  My ex seems to believe that this is it, that they're going to expel him.

I spoke with her pediatrician before the school year started because of the behavior concerns. She was talking incessantly, refusing to do tasks, and complained that when she wasn't running around her legs hurt. She wasn't unmanageable and we could mostly manage her behavior through positive reinforcement and the occasional loss of privileges. 
The doctor said the school would handle my daughter's assessment for ADHD. Good to hear. Well school started and my daughter became very aggressive and started having major meltdowns. It got so bad that she got kicked off the school bus to the charter school she was attending and I couldn't drive her. So we disenrolled her from that school and put her into the school that is easy walking distance from our apartment. 
 The same problems are happening at this school, but now her behaviors are escalating at home. She has these meltdowns and says really mean things to me. She throws things and yells and is just generally really rude and cruel to me. I've tried various forms of discipline but nothing really works. The only thing that has even a little bit of success is taking away her screen time, but then when she does get screen time it makes her behavior so much worse. 
 Her behavior at school is shocking. She's been violent, and tries to get the other kids into trouble, even going so far as to give herself a paper cut and blame it on a boy who upset her. She has meltdowns when there are loud noises and tries to eat foods she knows she's allergic to. I'm scared for her. They said we would have a meeting with the health and wellness team this week, which I was looking forward to because it seemed like something may finally be done for her, but it never happened.
  I've got her on the list for behavioral health services, but they're saying it's going to be eight weeks before they have an appointment available. With things escalating the way that they are I'm at a loss of what to do. My mom says this is just the way kids are so she's no help. Our friends don't always like being around us because of the way my daughter behaves. It's so incredibly frustrating. I guess I'm just looking for advice.

My son's girlfriend wants to come and live with me.,Parenting,3,dg1sxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dg1sxu/my_sons_girlfriend_wants_to_come_and_live_with_me/,11,1570759126.0,"My son Danny is 14. He lived with me up until the age of 11 until he went to live with his father. His dad is from quite a different background to myself, much more well off and could afford to provide the best possible education. 

Although he was sent to a very good private boys school, Danny eventually got frustrated with living with his father and asked to come back and live with me, which he has been doing for the last eight months and has been attending the local school. 

Danny has a girlfriend called Lucy. She's from the same sort of background as Danny's dad. Parents very well off and also attends a prestigious girl's school. She has come and stayed with us a few times and is absolutely lovely. Very smart and pretty, and wants to be a lawyer when she's older. Her parents are in the same social circles as his father which is how they met. 

Danny and Lucy don't get to spend much time together since her family live miles away. The last time she was here, she told me that she wants to live here with Danny, move to the school he goes to etc, and was wondering if it were possible. Apparently her parents are extremely controlling and pressuring (much like Danny's dad), and are also cold because they wanted a boy so they could ''continue the family line'' and have always resented her for that. 

I was pretty floored and was sure that this was just teen hormones talking. I'd be happy to have her since she's lovely, but the problem is we're basing this off a teenage relationship. Don't get me wrong, I've seen them together and I know these two adore each other, but we all know teenage relationships don't always work out, which would make things awkward if she's living with us. 

More importantly there is all the legal stuff to it. I'm sure her parents would fight it if I tried to become her guardian. I'm not even sure what the process to becoming a guardian is in the UK, but I'm sure it will be a thousand times more difficult if her parents are fighting it (especially as I don't doubt they can afford much better lawyers than me). 

A more minor point: Lucy moving here would mean a big lifestyle change for her. I make a decent income and can afford to live comfortably, and could probably afford one more mouth to feed, but Lucy has lived in the lap of luxury since she was born. Danny, at least, spent his formative years here and so when he moved back here it was just returning to normal rather than a jarring change. Lucy is used to a very different lifestyle to me. I've been out shopping with her, and while she's never been snobby or rude, she was genuinely surprised that I buy clothes from the supermarket. She and her parents have only ever gone to high end stores, and the kind of clothes she wears every day just aren't what I can afford on a regular basis. She gets driven practically everywhere which I certainly can't do with my work commitments. She's also always been to schools with people from her sort of background. We live in a fairly open minded community, but I'm worried that Lucy won't make many friends here because there won't be many people she has a lot in common with. I'm just concerned that Lucy might have a miserable time here and grow to resent me and Danny for it.  

Danny himself is all for it, but then what 15 year old boy doesn't want his girlfriend living with him. I'm not against it but would need some more info first.

Is it possible my breast milk is no longer enough?,Parenting,2,dg39yk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dg39yk/is_it_possible_my_breast_milk_is_no_longer_enough/,28,1570765009.0,"Hi everyone!

So after 2 weeks of sleepless nights,  I decided someone here might have good tips :-)

Our 6 months baby was never ""good"" with sleep. We had to battle every nap, and each nap was no longer than 40 minutes (exactly one sleep cycle). It looks like his always over stimulated because his very curious and if there is something to look at, he will. So most of the time they go him to sleep, we had to put some sort of blanket on his eyes or else he won't close his eyes. We got to an OK spot where we would sleep 2-3 hours between the time when he wakes up to the night sleep (and those also require fighting him). The night sleep would be feed (breast feeding) -> 5-6 hours of sleep -> feed time again -> 4 hours before his hungry again. 

It was far from perfect (it seems like everyone around me has sleeping babies), but it worked :-) But something changed two weeks ago. Where previously he was able move between one cycle to another (most cycles anyway) he know wakes up every 1 cycle (40 minutes ) or two cycles. He won't get back to sleep, unless rocked or fed. 

I was checking online and read about the 6 months feeding growth sprout that takes a week. So I went diving down into it, feeding him more often. It just it's already 2 weeks now, and it's not improved - and it seems worse.  The baby will now won't go to sleep in his normal hours in the evening, and will be very crunky. He will cry when put on his cry, cry when I hold him on sleep position, cry when he enter his room even. But when taken to the living room - looks all smily and happy. So I'm not sure it's a medical problem and the Doctors says the same. It's like he refuse to go to sleep. And I know his very tired because he keep pulling his ears and itching eyes. We tried to sleep training (we avoid it because it used to work without it) and this only makes him hysterical. After 10 minutes of sleeping, his all out of air, and screaming/shaking in crisis. His taken it so hard, It's take me couple of minutes to snap him out of it even on my hands. So I'm trying to avoid it for now (or maybe I shouldn't?).

In the last 2-3 days he started to moan and cry on my breast. This was the only thing that was ALWAYS make him relaxed and sleepy. Like his being bothered. I'm starting to think that after 6 months breast milk is not enough for him. His very tall, and weight around 9 Kg (19.8 pounds). We started a week ago with solid food, but only for testing allergies, so it's not big portions.  Maybe it's time to mix in formula?","Is it possible my breast milk is no longer enough?Hi everyone!

My 3yr old boy seems to be a normal young lad. He‚Äôs been going to daycare twice weekly since he was 18 months old however he‚Äôs been described to me as a bit of a loner and doesn‚Äôt do well in group settings.

He‚Äôs been doing what I found to be strange since he was 2 and I thought he would just grow out of it. When we meet a child at a park he‚Äôll approach them and stand in front of them until they meet his eyes and stare a them wordlessly. This is usually followed by both sets of parents asking their respective toddler to say ‚ÄúHi‚Äù or ask each other their names. No matter what happened with the other party ours won‚Äôt say anything. He‚Äôll get in between children and their

What if she is like my mom, dad or brother? What if I don‚Äôt like my own daughter? OMG I wake up in the middle of the night terrified I‚Äôll be toxic towards her or she will be toxic. And then she‚Äôll do drugs and run away and marry some bum and never talk to me again!!! My mind is ruminating, as you can see.

2. I was an ugly duckling. I turned out pretty nice looking, but boy was I ugly when I was a pre-teen. Even before pre-teen. And I wasn‚Äôt athletic. I was just so awkward, and I was severely bullied. What if she looks like me and is bullied?  I wouldn‚Äôt wish my life on anyone, and the thought of her looking like me terrifies me.

We put this one in bed at around 7/8pm and she will make 1000 excuses as to why she had to get out (had to pee, forgot to put something in my backpack, random pains, hunger, etc.) and/or will stay awake in her room and not sleep until 10 or later. If we get fed up and let her go to our bed, she is out like a light though.

As you can imagine this makes the mornings pretty unbearbale as she is always cranky. She's so tired that we end up having to brush her teeth and wash her up and dress her. She's 6, she should be doing this all herself.

Any tips are greatly appreciated. Also, anyone have any ideas as to the underlying psychological causes of this? Anything to pay attention to or be concerned about?

Advice needed - which school district is best?,Parenting,1,dg0d0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dg0d0x/advice_needed_which_school_district_is_best/,2,1570753064.0,"I live in a moderately affluent suburb of a large US midwestern city. My city does not have its own school district - it actually feeds into four different school districts, depending on where you live. We purposely chose to buy in an area of the city that feeds into a school district that is less-desirable. Our school district also draws from more working-class suburbs and is much more racially and socio-economically diverse than the other three in our city (one of which is widely recognized as the best district in the state). Our son‚Äôs elementary school is the highest performing in the district and has a higher concentration of affluent families than the other elementary schools in the district due to its location in the ‚Äúaffluent‚Äù city. While the district‚Äôs academic record is less-stellar than others, we figured that we could always supplement his academics, but it would be more difficult to provide him with the kind of racial and socio-economic diversity that his school/district offers. He‚Äôs gone to this school since kindergarten and is now in 4th grade. We have a great community of families at this school and we‚Äôre also deeply involved with our local little league. We really have a great community here. 

My wife and I both went to the same large public high school in another state in a district that was very affluent. There were definite pros and cons, but overall, we both felt like little fish in a huge sea and since you had to be the best of the best for almost any activity or academic area, we both felt mediocre, despite being bright, talented people. This sense of self has been pervasive into our adult lives and we didn‚Äôt want our son to have that same experience. 

The high school our son will attend in our district is good enough, but it‚Äôs not outstanding. There‚Äôs a real opportunity to stand out, even if you‚Äôre not The Most Amazing Ever. Our son is a bright kid - he catches on to concepts really quickly and can move through curriculum at a rate that‚Äôs faster than most of his peers. He‚Äôs also a pretty talented athlete who LOVES baseball and it‚Äôs looking like baseball will always play a big role in his life. He‚Äôs in his school‚Äôs gifted and talented program and while I think he‚Äôs bright and motivated, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs exceptional. Still, in order to be actually challenged academically in elementary school, he relies on the one hour a week of gifted and talented programming he gets. The rest of the time I feel like he‚Äôs just treading water. I believe he should be receiving the same level of challenge most of the time in his regular classroom. I‚Äôve joined my district‚Äôs gifted and talented advisory committee and the district is planning changes that I see as positive, but it‚Äôs slow-moving and I‚Äôm not convinced that their efforts won‚Äôt ultimately fall short of what I know my son needs. 

So here‚Äôs my conundrum. The next town over has a school district that has a really stellar baseball program and is much more academically rigorous than our current district. Their gifted and talented program is incredibly well thought out and meets the needs of a diverse range of learners. I know we‚Äôd be able to find the appropriate academic challenge for him in that district. And since their baseball program is so strong, I know he‚Äôd be well-positioned to really grow in that area too (I should note that we have him in a private baseball development academy which he‚Äôd attend no matter where we live). As for the community, it‚Äôs VERY affluent - more than where we are now. We can afford to live there, but I understand that there‚Äôs a pretty clear divide between the ‚ÄúHaves‚Äù and the ‚ÄúHave-nots.‚Äù We‚Äôd for sure be in the ‚ÄúHave-nots‚Äù camp. Plus they have one high school and it gives me flashbacks to my own experience. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. Do we stay where we are, embedded with our community and all his friends, continue to be involved to make things better for my son and for all the students in the district, or do we leave and go where our son can be appropriately challenged in both academics and athletics, but will likely struggle more to stand out and risk him developing a feeling of never being enough? What harm is there in not providing him with the challenge he needs? Is it better to be a big fish in a little pond? Or a medium fish in a huge ocean? Might he have more opportunities if he can really stand out as an athlete? Or will he become a better player if he‚Äôs playing in a well-funded program with a team of talented players?

We just have one kid and I‚Äôm acutely aware that we get one shot at this parenting thing. I want to do right by him and help him be his very best self, I‚Äôm just struggling to know how to do that. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? What choice did you make? Would you make the same choice again?","Advice needed - which school district is best?I live in a moderately affluent suburb of a large US midwestern city. My city does not have its own school district - it actually feeds into four different school districts, depending on where you live. We purposely chose to buy in an area of the city that feeds into a school district that is less-desirable. Our school district also draws from more working-class suburbs and is much more racially and socio-economically diverse than the other three in our city (one of which is widely recognized as the best district in the state). Our son‚Äôs elementary school is the highest performing in the district and has a higher concentration of affluent families than the other elementary schools in the district due to its location in the ‚Äúaffluent‚Äù city. While the district‚Äôs academic record is less-stellar than others, we figured that we could always supplement his academics, but it would be more difficult to provide him with the kind of racial and socio-economic diversity that his school/district offers. He‚Äôs gone to this school since kindergarten and is now in 4th grade. We have a great community of families at this school and we‚Äôre also deeply involved with our local little league. We really have a great community here. 

My wife and I both went to the same large public high school in another state in a district that was very affluent.

Currently my little guy is 8 weeks old. He sleeps in my room in a bassinet. We live in Canada so it's already pretty chilly here and we've got the heat on.

Here's my problem. We currently have our little guy in footie pj's (cotton), a swaddle wrap and then a muslin swaddle on top. He does sleep this way but does a lot of grunting relatively frequently so I don't think it's a restful sleep. And, of course, I wake at every single noise he makes so I'm not getting a good sleep either.

On occasion I've also swaddled him with all of the above plus a fleecy blanket. He sleeps much more soundly BUT when I wake him for feeds, he is sweaty which isn't good (right?).

Just looking for suggestions, or other parents' experiences with keeping their little one warm but not too hot. TIA.","How to keep my Little warm during the winter without overheating!?Hi everyone, first time mom (31) here. Just looking for some general advice re: the title.

She's a very hard working girl and she's very talented in running. I'm just so worried about her health. During the summer she was going to 9th grade, she told me she probably only slept 1 - 3 hours on average... and she never took naps. She had to wake up at 5:45 AM for morning practice and then she'd have to go to SAT prep from 12 PM - 6 PM. When she comes home she wants time to herself to relax, so she said she didn't start on her SAT homework until 3 AM, so usually she'd sleep around 3- 4 AM then wake up an hour & 30 mins later for practice. This all happened when she just turned 14 years old. I don't know how she was even able to run so well like this. They have races in the summer and she's running 2 miles in 13 minutes and is already one of the fastest girls in the team. I'm just scared that her horrible sleep schedule has stunted her growth. Her sleeping schedule hasn't gotten any better at all. Sometimes I wish I can pull her out of high school but her dream school for college is very hard to get into and she told me she has to sacrifice sleep just to get into it. But lately, she has been complaining about how she thinks she stunted her growth and I would tell her that she didn't stunt it (but I don't know the real answer to this)

I know I shouldn't be worried about her growth, but it is worrying me. I don't want her to regret this later and feel bad about herself later. She is already regretting it. If it matters, she got her growth spurt from age 11 - 12 where she grew 4 inches. She got her period 3 months after turning 12. From age 12 - 13 she grew 2.5 inches. From age 13 - 14 it seems like she didn't grow at all, half an inch at the most, but she had a normal sleeping schedule at this time.  From age 14 - 15 when her sleeping schedule was absolutely messed up, she didn't grow at all.

Experience with encopresis/accidents,Parenting,5,dfsu7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dfsu7t/experience_with_encopresisaccidents/,1,1570710593.0,"Hi all, throwaway as really very lost about what to do with my daughter and her potty training.

I've been told what we have been experiencing is encopresis, but I've also read that only gets diagnosed after 4, she is 3.5, so wondering if this is true encopresis or can we just put it down to accidents during training?

Basically we struggled immensely at the start, pee no problem but small poo accidents several times daily. Withholding, associated constipation, potty refusal, the works. We dropped it and eased off the pressure and suddenly she has turned into a star, will tell us when she needs to do a poo, and has had an amazing run of two weeks with only the occasional poo accident. This is after about 3 months of training.

The problem now seems to be that the accidents start up again when she misses a day, we are finding if she does one big poo a day then she is fine. Which makes me inclined to think it is encopresis, and not just an accident.

I suppose I wanted to know if anyone has gone through a similar experience and how did you handle it? Did they eventually just come good and no more accidents? I know people promote medical interventions for encopresis but she seems to be doing so well that I don't think she needs any help.

"Kid ""shopping"" in our house - talk to her or parent?",Parenting,32,dfith4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dfith4/kid_shopping_in_our_house_talk_to_her_or_parent/,15,1570664471.0,"My 8 yo daughter has a friend ""Sierra"" who comes over from time to time. Her mom asks if she can come here before or after school sometimes when school schedules change, and I'm glad to help. However, my kid is getting soured on Sierra because of this behavior: she sorta ""shops"" in our house. 

By this I mean she asks for things. Random things she likes. She is pretty pushy, too. Once it was a button box that belonged to my great aunt. She said she really liked it and asked ""Do you use this??"" I said it's a decoration and usually has buttons on it but my toddler dumped them. She said """"I would play with it all the time. Do you need it?"" I said it was my aunt's and I'm not giving it away.

After that visit my kid complained that Sierra asked for many things. My kid is pretty generous, though, and she made it worse I think by offering her a few toys. I told my kid not to offer to give Sierra anything bc it would encourage her to keep asking.

Next visit my kid forgot and Sierra asked again for other things, so my kid said no. I reminded her afterward to stop giving things away bc it encourages Sierra's asking. 

The last one was the last straw. My kid didn't offer her anything. But she got fixated on this little rock my kid got as a souvenir. It was on a shelf. She kept going on and on: ""I love rocks. I don't have one like that."" My kid said no, then asked Sierra to come in her room to play. Sierra said ""I'll only play with you of you give me that rock.""

I intervened and told her no, my kid said no, and it was her souvenir from x place so it's not ""just a rock ""

I would like to try dealing with this more directly before I give up. First off should I just talk to the kid next time she's over, or go through her mom? 

If I talk to her I was thinking of saying ""Sierra, it's not really nice to come over and ask to take people's things. I'm telling you this because we really like you, and I'm glad you think we have nice things, but when you ask and don't accept no for an answer it makes it hard for (my kid) to play with you. Please stop asking.""

Is that to much, not enough, etc?

So my daughter is 5 and has a terrible time sharing my attention with anyone else (just mine and not my husband's/her father). I assume this is because I'm with her almost everyday, all day. I'm a stay at home mom and will be until she starts kindergarten next year. Today I watched one of my nieces and my daughter just couldn't stand that I was paying attention to anyone but her. They did great until about 2 hours in and we were at a trampoline park to burn off some energy. After that it was a fight for attention (I should say my niece, she's 2, has a brother my daughter's age, when I've watched my nephew this wasn't a problem). I'm just unsure how to handle this since I only have 1 kid to contend with most days and honestly I'm mostly worried about how this will play out once she goes to school. She will most definitely not be the center of attention (which I've explained to her) because the teacher and or/ the aid will have about 20 other students or so to contend with. She interacts with plenty of kids in our neighborhood and also sports activities, and having them over tonplay with, this is not a problem for her, other than being bossy because she's stubborn and wants things her way (she has gotten much better about this and letting this roll off her shoulders), she does great. The problem seems to be she's not the center of my attention, mostly with family, even though I've explained to her that her aunt put her child in my care and I'm responsible for her safety. What would you say is the best way to handle this? I'll admit for the first couple of years I was a helicopter mom, not knowing really how to deal with a kid. I've backed off, let her fall down and hurt herself after I told her something was dangerous. First hand experience is a good thing for kids to live through. I guess after this I'm questioning how to deal with the jealousy of me watching her cousins and if this behavior will bleed into her going to school for the first time.","Only child dealing with sharing attention.Hey guys.

He‚Äôs started talking in three word sentences Or putting together multiple small phrases to tell a story in the last few weeks. So far he‚Äôs only told stories that he was involved in or stories from a show that he‚Äôs watched. He goes to an in-home daycare run by an older woman.

And he hit himself on his chest while doing this. This was concerning so my wife has been trying to get more out of him.

I work M-F, 7ish to 5ish, she works a variable 7a-7p with some weekends.  It's a great schedule for us, as we only have to worry about child-care for those weekdays when she's working, and my MIL watches him on those days.

The problem lately though is the housework.  See, on the weekend days she's working, I am constantly picking up behind the kid to keep the house somewhat straight...of course there are messes, but I never let them get out of control.  When she's home with the kid, though, she just lets him run amok and trash the place to the point where, I roll up to the house at 5:30 and it's like a bomb went off inside, not just in the living room and the other play areas, but the kitchen has the remnants of the entire day's worth of meals all over the counters, dirty dishes stacked to the ceiling.  Like every toy the kid owns (and he's got **a lot**) dumped into a pile in the living room, legos and and markers and shit everywhere, strewn about the whole house.  We eat dinner about when I get home, give the kid a bath, read him a story and lay him down...then both end up having to spend two hours every night just getting everything picked up, vacuuming cookies off the rugs, sweeping and mopping the whole house, etc.  It takes the two of us until after 8pm to get everything put back the way it should be and cleaned up, and then it's pretty much bedtime for us...rinse/repeat.  I've mentioned to her that it would be nice to come home from work once in a while and *not* have the house look like the morning after a frat party, but her argument is that ""he's only going to be small for so long, and I don't want to waste time cleaning when we can be playing together, we can just do it when he goes to bed.""

Here and there is one thing, but this is almost *every single night*.  It's seriously starting to get to me as I feel like I'm literally working all day, every day.  She's watching the kid all day and I know how exhausting it can be, but I'm working all day too.  I'm not going to sit there and let her clean the whole house by herself because I'm not an asshole, but just once I want us both to be able to sit on the couch together after we put the kid to bed and enjoy a TV show or something...we never can.  Leaving it is *not* an option, either...my wife won't rest until the house is cleaned up.

Every single night is like this.

I guess I'm just curious how most households handle this kind of shit, because I feel like the way we're going is not sustainable, and it's stressing me out.

Its painful and it hurts, but if our story can prevent another death it brings me a little peace.

Isabella was born today, 7 years ago.  I was 24 and she was my first child.  My pregnancy was easy and so was labor and delivery.  She was born healthy and perfect in every way.  We had 7 wonderful weeks with her before she died.

She was a terrible sleeper, she would sleep for 40 minutes at a time and be awake for two hours after day and night.  We didn't know about swaddle Sacks back then, and I didn't know about safe sleeping.

On her last day of life in was desperate for sleep, so my husband stayed up with her so I could sleep.  She was propped up on the couch with pillows and her homemade tinkerbell blanket made by my grandmother.  I woke up at 230am and thought I should go check on them, but I was so tired I fell back asleep.  I'll never forgive myself for that.

At 430am I woke up to my husband screaming he couldn't wake her up.  We called 911, we did CPR for what felt like forever until EMS arrived.  Revival attempts were unsuccessful, and we left the hospital without our precious daughter, to go home to our apartment full of her things with nothing to do but grieve.

My husband fell asleep watching TV sitting up.  He woke up at 430 laying down with his legs on her chest.  The weight was too much for her little body and she suffocated because she couldn't breath.

We have had two other beautiful children since and another little girl due any day.  All my girls have been born in October, a sign I believe from above from our tiny angel to make this month a little easier for me.

So to all you new parents who think it would never happen to you, get the monitors that detect breathing.  If your tired, put the baby in the the crib or bassinet.  Be neurotic and crazy and listen to your instinct.  I pray you never go through what we have, and you never have to bury your child.

He no longer asks for play dates with his real friends from school, or hangs out with kids in the neighborhood.

All he wants to do is play minecraft.  When he's told to practice his musical instrument, it's a fight.  When he has to go to his sporting practice, it's a minor battle.  When I want to do something outside the house, it's stomping around.

I realize I have created this monster by allowing access to electronics and never had  a strict limit on usage.  Yes I know I'll be judged for that, but the reality of it is, the entire household is tied to some for of electronic addition.  So, what do I do now?  I'm not asking him to give up his game, it's not affecting his school, but I just wish he would want some actual human interaction.

Last night, after another sports practice, he tells me he doesn't want to do it anymore.  Even though his coach recommended him to move up a level because he's shown improvement.  Then he kept stalling in practicing his music....I just broke down.  I don't know why but the tears would not stop falling.

Toddler Atypical Speech Patterns,Parenting,11,dfbvm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dfbvm2/toddler_atypical_speech_patterns/,14,1570623657.0,"This is a bit long, but I would love to hear from any parents or speech therapists with experience with the these particular atypical speech patterns mentioned below:

My son will be 3 soon. He speaks in full sentences but is very hard to understand. He uses filler sounds (usually ""hnn"" or ""ng"")  for words he can't say and has trouble with some vowel sounds. For example, he pronounces ""car"" as ""cnng."" And ""two"" is ""tnn."" He recognizes letters and numbers up to at least 11, but he doesn't actually say most of the numbers--he'll say ""one, tnn, tnn, tnn, hnn, hnn, hnnn, eight, nine, tnn, eleven!"" But he can easily identify the written numbers. This is just mentioned as an example--his speech is filled with these substitutions/filler sounds. His intonation/number of syllables is correct though.

We've been working with a speech therapist through the county since he was about 20 months, and recently had an evaluation with private insurance. He tested extremely behind his peers (in language) but too young to say for sure if he has a motor planning disorder such as apraxia. 

His receptive language skills are very high and he loves to eat. I haven't noticed any unusual sensory issues. He can use a straw, spoon, etc. He enjoys being with other children but is generally more quiet and reserved. 

He's getting very discouraged when I try working with him at home. We've been working on the long ""oo"" sound and he tends to pronounce it more like ""ee"" in isolation and then cut out the vowel completely if it's paired with a consonant like ""t"" or ""c."" But he can say ""moo"" and ""boo;"" they just sound a little more like a blend between ""oo"" and ""ee.""

He was starting to stutter (but seems to be subsiding), cover his face, and say he can't do it or doesn't know how. He doesn't like making mistakes or being put on the spot and would rather not try at all. I really don't want him to be discouraged but also want to help him as much as possible. 

He also almost always refers to himself in the third person. 

We have had him evaluated for hearing issues and by an ENT. Everything is fine. 

I would greatly appreciate any insights/experiences. We are working with a lot of people but I would love to just have an answer and figure out how I can best help him.

Edit: Thank you so much to all who responded! I should add that everyone we've worked with has been wonderful; I am just trying to seek out all avenues of information possible--you never know what might help. He's been responding really well to low-pressure therapy snuck in throughout the day. I also have been supplementing with a fun YouTube channel called Yak Back Pack.

Anyone have advice about 9-10m old hitting/scratching?,Parenting,2,dfh2ri,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dfh2ri/anyone_have_advice_about_910m_old/,2,1570656664.0,"Pretty much title. 

My 9 1/2 m old has a major problem with hitting and scratching. It is constant when I hold her, which makes me not even want to hold her anymore.


I've tried multiple things such as ""yelping"" when she hurts me, but all she does is lean back, giggle, and do it again. I've tried sturn ""no"" and redirect her to something else, but she will just either smack me with whatever it is, or keep going.

She's been doing it for awhile, its been constant. Its kinda driving me nuts because I just want to hold and play with her but I guess her version of playing is smacking the crap out of me or scratching me (I cut her nails on a regular basis, but they still hurt!!). I try my hardest not to let her, especially my face because my glasses are old and will break within a second in her hands (they are literally held together with gorilla glue) and we can't afford new glasses and I'm nearly blind without them. 


Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.","Anyone have advice about 9-10m old hitting/scratching?Pretty much title.

To preface; My kids father, he passed away about 3 or 4 years ago now, he was a mean piece of work to me and my boy whom is 7 (Captain). Though never physical, it was all mental and emotional, mostly towards me, but he saw A LOT of it, which has made him protective of me, and his little sister whom is 5 (Tiny). We moved away from him in a sudden move, and we are doing a lot better, but the kids father, in between the 2 years we moved away and he passes away he saw the kids 3 times, and made no attempt to see them either, THEY DO NOT KNOW ANY FULL DETAILS. What came up yesterday while he was in school has me so confused I don't know what to do.

What happened: While in school Captian shared this ""My father died, he was a soldier who was fighting for Canada, and he died while fighting for Canada!"" 
Now hes increadably proud of this story, the problem is, it isn't true in the slightest. I have been seeing someone, who in the Air Force, so I think poor Captain has gotten the 2 of them confused and is trying to make up reasons why his father wasn't around. 
When I told him that he maybe getting my Boyfriend and his father confused (not the part of trying to figure out why his dad wasn't around) and that his father was just a regular person, it was like I broke his heart.

I'm having trouble trying to process all of this, as I have NO idea on how to break all this to him, obviously with this story coming about, I need to tell him, in an age appropriate way as to WHY his father was never around, and potentially why we moved away the way we did.

How can I do this? I wanted to protect him from the truth just a little longer.","How to break the truth to my 7 year old.First off I'd like to apologize if this a bit all over the place, I'm trying to get my thoughts straight and figure out the best way to do this.

In 3 seasons, he's never had a ""winning"" season - always lost many more games than won. He's reasonably skilled and understands the importance of playing positions and strategy.

He's starting to get disillusioned and has been expressing that he doesn't want to go to soccer. He's frustrated that most of the kids on his team have no clue how to play (which is true cause of the club's approach). I keep telling him to focus on being a leader and setting a good example of teamwork... but he's done hearing it and I'm getting done saying it (though I believe in those ideals).

I can't afford to move him to a more competitive club/league at this time but I'm worried he's going to hate soccer over this. We both want him to learn and develop his skills but we're both losing hope with this club/league.

BTW, I coached for two seasons and most of the parents couldn't give a crap whether their kid wins or loses. Most sit in their cars during practices and games.

EDIT: I posted below but his friends had online world building like D&D but they made a micronation. In there people would create threads and one asked what role they would have in the nation and gave options: sniper, general, army, navy and why they should get the role. My kid responded sniper and said things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be the sniper, tell me who your enemies are and they‚Äôll be gone. I‚Äôll use a gun(can‚Äôt remember what kind he said)...‚Äù etc. this was on his school computer. It was reported as a threat so he has been suspended for it. I agree that it was a colossally stupid thing for him to do and I also understand that any gun threat has to be taken very seriously, but I don't know if its send him away bad.

Also, this is the only Disney trip we're planning on taking. We've never been and don't plan on doing this again."

A study on how I ruined my 14 mo‚Äôs life,Parenting,81,dexnr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dexnr1/a_study_on_how_i_ruined_my_14_mos_life/,40,1570556246.0,"My daughter is an amazing eater. She eats pretty much anything, anytime. She loves oranges and tomatoes and apples the most. I‚Äôve never had to encourage her to eat anything or try anything new. She just loves to eat. 

She‚Äôs also a decent sleeper and never takes more than an hour to get down and that‚Äôs a rare, bad day. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, we still have our sleep challenges like waking up in the middle of the night and taking a couple of hours to go back down, but the initial laying down is usually pretty smooth. 

So tonight we took her to a buffet so she could have many different things. She loves this. The last thing I get her is a plate with some cantaloupe, lychee, a jello cube, and an orange slice. She loves oranges and doesn‚Äôt want help eating so I was trying to be hands off but she kept eating the peel and so I thought I would peel the slice for her. 

I. Ruined. Her. Whole. Life. 

She got very upset and cried and wouldn‚Äôt touch it. She didn‚Äôt want any of her other food. She didn‚Äôt want a new orange slice. She didn‚Äôt want to be held by me. She didn‚Äôt want a cookie for the ride home. She cried so much. 

When we got home she fought her bath, which she loves, she fought her jammies, which is normal. I offered her a banana. No. An apple. No. Leftover lasagna, a favorite. Nope. 

We play baby shark and try to play with her. It‚Äôs a complete no go and makes her cry harder. So we read her a story through her tears and laid her down. She wouldn‚Äôt stop crying. I suspect at this point that she is pretty hungry. I offer her apple sauce pouches (strawberry and the coveted cinnamon), I offered her graham crackers, fruit snacks, gold fish, I cut a tomato, I cut an apple, I sent daddy out for strawberries, I offered her a clementine (peeled, what can I say), yogurt, popcorn, everything in the house she could have. It was all a no.

I tried Tylenol, she has almost all of her baby teeth and is only missing 6, 4 of which are 2nd molars that are trying to poke through. She still cried. I took her temp, inspected for diaper rash and just generally started to panic because she has never cried like this before. Daddy is doing bicycles even though she farts on her own like a grown man. 

Finally, while I‚Äôm rocking her, I take a sip of water and she wants it. She drinks some water. Good start. We are 4 hours into bedtime and 6 hours past the orange incident at this point. So I have daddy bring me a cheese stick. And I eat it. And she asks for some. So I give her some and we get her another for herself. She asks for more. There are no more cheese sticks but I start offering more of her favorites. She accepts a banana. Then she wants another one. Ok. After the second banana she wants a third. We are out of bananas, besides I‚Äôm not willing to send my spiraling life down the course of giving an angry constipated toddler her first enema. I offer an apple. Nope. 

Mom has once again ruined her life. She cries. I cry. We try everything again. Nothing. She‚Äôs sniveling in my arms as I rock her and daddy brings offerings of peace to the goddess of no sleep. Two more hours pass and she finally passes out in my arms. I laid her down and she didn‚Äôt wake up, very unusual but I‚Äôm not complaining.

I'll get straight to the point, my 7yo is constantly sad or upset. She's such a sensitive soul and takes everything either literal, or to heart. If I tell her off (even simply just telling her nonchalantly) she thinks I hate her and cries. She gets jealous of her 3yo sister so it can be difficult to be loving with her infront of my 7yo, because she accuses me of loving her more than my 7yo and will then cry. If I say anything remotely negative (correcting her when we learn her spellings for example) she will cry. I put them both to bed tonight and my 7yo was singing and my 3yo was asking her to stop so she could sleep (they like sharing a bunk bed/room even though they have seperate rooms), I asked her to please stop and she again cried. You can't play games with her because if she loses, she cries. I love to play Roblox with her but if I do something she didn't want me to do she will cry. 

She gets quite upset with our family situation too. She will stay at our house half of the week and her grandparents the other (her father/my ex still lives with them). She has a really strong bond with me and her grandparents. The thing is she cries whenever she is at one because she misses the other. Today she cried as her grandparents dropped her off because she wanted to stay with them but does the same for me when she goes to their house. I hear her cry in bed at night because she misses them and has mentioned that she cries because she doesn't want them to die (as far as i'm aware they are completely healthy 50 somethings!). 

She's cried a few times the past few days because she feels like she doesn't get enough time to see everyone she loves because of school (which can't be helped). 

I'm not sure how to handle it all in the best way for her. Atm when shes upset she asks to cuddle so tonight we lay in my dressing gown and cuddled chatting about school etc. Because we are so close we usually cuddle anyway but when she's sad I tend to take time out just for her. Apart from that i'm stumped on how to help her. I don't know if she's hormonal or what, but my heart aches for her. 

I've taken her to her GP in the past few months for symptoms I thought were pointing to procotious puberty, but was told she's a healthy normal 7yo. I don't know how else to help her so any advice is welcome","7yo always upset/cryingHi all, looking for some advice for my 7yo..

You can't play games with her because if she loses, she cries. I love to play Roblox with her but if I do something she didn't want me to do she will cry. 

She gets quite upset with our family situation too. She will stay at our house half of the week and her grandparents the other (her father/my ex still lives with them). She has a really strong bond with me and her grandparents. The thing is she cries whenever she is at one because she misses the other. Today she cried as her grandparents dropped her off because she wanted to stay with them but does the same for me when she goes to their house. I hear her cry in bed at night because she misses them and has mentioned that she cries because she doesn't want them to die (as far as i'm aware they are completely healthy 50 somethings!). 

She's cried a few times the past few days because she feels like she doesn't get enough time to see everyone she loves because of school (which can't be helped). 

I'm not sure how to handle it all in the best way for her. Atm when shes upset she asks to cuddle so tonight we lay in my dressing gown and cuddled chatting about school etc. Because we are so close we usually cuddle anyway but when she's sad I tend to take time out just for her. Apart from that i'm stumped on how to help her. I don't know if she's hormonal or what, but my heart aches for her. 

I've taken her to her GP in the past few months for symptoms I thought were pointing to procotious puberty, but was told she's a healthy normal 7yo. I don't know how else to help her so any advice is welcome"

Fast forward to last week. She takes me aside at pickup and tells me that my sweet 5 year old who wouldn't hurt a fly is being physical with other kids and that he is being defiant with her. I told her we were experiencing a little defiance at home too and that we were working on it. She tells me she is putting him on a behavior plan. I still don't know what the end goal of this is.

Today I was talking to her, and she said that I seemed frustrated with the situation. I told her yes I was because I hadn't received any communication from her about this behavior and I was frustrated. She then told me it was my responsibility to be asking about his behavior. The problem is, I feel I opened the door by asking about his behavior early on. She could have told me about his behavior at that time but chose not to.

 She also dropped the bomb after I told her I was frustrated with her lack of communication that he hit an adult last week?

I feel like 12 is getting a bit up there in age and I don't really want to shell out money for a costume since I have two other kids to buy for. I never trick or treated at this age. Will most people still give candy? Does it come across as disrespectful, greedy, or trashy at that age?

Drop sleep sack for 14 month old,Parenting,3,df2qvx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/df2qvx/drop_sleep_sack_for_14_month_old/,17,1570582493.0,"I am the mother to a very sweet 14 month old girl. She is a GREAT sleeper and has been for a long long time. I was kind of a freak about keeping her crib safe when she was a baby. No bumpers or blankets or pillows. She never slept in bed with us even accidentally. I even installed a ceiling fan in her room before she was born because I read an article that the air circulation drastically reduces the risk of SIDS.

Now that she‚Äôs a little older I‚Äôm thinking about getting rid of the sleep sack.

She has fleece footy pajamas that she can use for winter and we also have cotton footie pajamas but I‚Äôve noticed she doesn‚Äôt sleep as well without a sack and I worry she‚Äôs cold. Also her room can get cold as she has a humidifier and a ceiling fan. Once we turn the heat on her room will get comfortable but it‚Äôs one of those things where when the heat is actually running it‚Äôs warm but once it clicks off it gets chilly again. That being said she‚Äôs always kind of leaned towards cold-natured and she‚Äôs not a particularly hefty kid. 

So my question is what should I do? Just put her down in footies and call it a day? Offer a blanket?

All of a sudden, I my oldest belly laugh. I look up and he and the dog are playing with a stick together, dog is going for the stick and oldest is giggling. It was a super sweet moment. They get along so well. 

My oldest goes to put the stick in his mouth to get the dog to take it. I'm totally fine with my boys getting dirty, but putting a dirty stick in their mouth is where I draw the line. So I go over to take the stick. Then I scream.

You may be asking why I screamed. I suggest you not ask that and stop reading now. 

You freaks still here? Fine.

The stick was actually poop. Poop that looked like a stick. I scream and go to take the poop (which has split in half at this point) away. Oldest thinks mommy is SO FUNNY. He starts running, a poop in each hand. So I'm running after him, screaming at him to drop the poops. He's laughing and bolting, dog is barking and chasing me. It's a disaster. 

I finally catch him, run inside and throw him in the tub. This is where he will stay until he's 18.

There are baby gates everywhere. He pulls them down. We are about to start bolting them to walls. I am a SAHM, and at my wits end. No baby toy in this house can distract him. A potato is normally a go to (for whatever reason it's the only thing he'll play with for more then a minute) He's learned to push things to get on furniture and tables. And if it shakes and makes a noise. It gets shook until something falls. 

I get down to play with him. Play with toys, play peak a boo, sometimes I put a sock on my head and he takes it off, that game tends to last awhile. But then hes off again to make trouble. He can't walk yet but the boy can climb. 

I don't know how to burn all this energy. Everytime I'm around someone else's baby they will sit and cuddle. Not my son, if you sit down with him on the couch he off to the races to try and grab anything previously out of reach. The only time he stops is the one nap he takes during the day. And putting him down for that nap I pretty much have to bear hug him to get him to stop moving. Then after a 5 to 10 minute fight he'll pass out. 

What can I do? Am I just gonna have to buckle down and push through until he has a better grasp of no? Is there some activity I can do to wear my little man out? At this point I feel so frustrated with him. I love him so dearly and he doesn't deserve a mom who gets upset as fast as I do.","My (11mo) son has NO CHILL.Since he has learned to crawl he will get into EVERYTHING.

He is in a Kinder and Gr1 split class. One day he mentioned to me that in the bathroom, another boy in his class put his mouth on his penis and his tongue in his mouth. I was shocked to hear that but don't know the best way forward. Is my son imagining it? Did he misunderstand or misrepresent the situation? If it did happen, it's hard to believe that the behaviour of the other boy is malicious or predatory at Gr.1. It would likely be curiosity. I don't want to villainize the other boy but I also want to protect my son. The thing is that my son did not have negative feelings towards the boy (so it seems) and he still played with him. We thought things were fine, just a momentary blip. But this event does seem to have occupied space in my son's psyche and memory. What to do? 

How many people do I bring this incident up? I don't plan to name the boy until we can all figure out who needs to know. Do I include just the principal or vice principal? Do I include the teacher? Also, if the boy does have inappropriate behaviour, it will be important to help him early on.

To all parents, it's important to talk to your children about these things and to probe for negative experiences to make sure they are safe.","Negative Body Interactions - Thoughts?My son in Kindergarten told me something surprising recently and I'm still processing it. He is in a Kinder and Gr1 split class. One day he mentioned to me that in the bathroom, another boy in his class put his mouth on his penis and his tongue in his mouth. I was shocked to hear that but don't know the best way forward. Is my son imagining it? Did he misunderstand or misrepresent the situation? If it did happen, it's hard to believe that the behaviour of the other boy is malicious or predatory at Gr.1. It would likely be curiosity. I don't want to villainize the other boy but I also want to protect my son. The thing is that my son did not have negative feelings towards the boy (so it seems) and he still played with him.

Wanted to share an experience I had with my toddler (long),Parenting,197,delr2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/delr2d/wanted_to_share_an_experience_i_had_with_my/,25,1570494187.0,"My (31M) toddler (almost 3M) has been having trouble with hitting when he feels frustrated.  We've talked and talked about how hitting is not okay, and that he should stomp his feet or yell in his room if he's feeling angry or frustrated.  He is getting better, but regulating emotions is a struggle for even the best 2 year old's.  

A few nights ago, we were winding down for bedtime while watching a show on TV.  We told him before we turned the TV on that we would be watching just one show, then off to start the bedtime routine.  He agrees, saying ""Okay, Daddy.""  We do this often if he's been a good boy in the later part of the day.  

Fast forward to the end of the show, I say ""Alright bud, time to go brush your teeth.""  Toddler announces very rudely and angrily that he wants to watch another show.  I decline and restated what we agreed to before the show began.  Toddler proceeds to yell and closed fist hit me in the leg.  Not hard like an adult, but toddler hard, and he definitely reacted out of anger.

I was fuming.  Getting hit is never pleasant, but it's especially bad when this is something we've been working on for some time now.  I roughly picked him up and we sped through the teeth brushing and book reading process.  He usually gets to be interactive with the bedtime goings on, not this time.  Dad was not allowing any pleasantries here:  ""No, we don't get to find letters in the book, when we hit"" and ""No, you don't get to help brush your teeth, when we hit"".  Normally, there's some cuddles, songs, and conversations about our respective days before I leave his room. This time, as soon as the book was finished, I just said good night, tossed him his blanket, and turned the light off.  

This is a pretty big breach of our bedtime ritual, and bedtime is something I hold to be very sacred.  I always am comforted by the dialog my little person and I have at bedtime, but this time I was still angry, and toddler could tell I was angry.  I always say ""I love you, see you tomorrow, buddy."", as I leave his room at night, but not tonight.

As I was leaving his room in a huff, and as the door was closing, I hear my little guy barely mumble something under his breath.  I poke my head in the door and sharply ask what he was mumbling about.  He was curled up in a ball, probably cold because he had no blanket.  He replies, ""I love you"", in a meek voice.  

My precious little boy shared the acknowledgement of love that I typically do as a parent, because I wasn't feeling very parental.  At that moment, my son was a bigger person than I, and it caught me completely off guard.  I just lost it. 

I went back in his room, sat on his bed, held him, and ugly cried with him for what seemed like forever.  I told him over and over how he's still a good boy, that I'm so proud of him, that I love him too, and that it makes both of us sad when we hit.  When we both regained our composure, he fell right asleep.  I laid him down with his cuddle bear, then I went to my wife who had just laid our newborn down for the night.  I proceeded to sob all over her as I shared what had just happened.

I'll remember this moment forever and I still tear up writing this.","Wanted to share an experience I had with my toddler (long)My (31M) toddler (almost 3M) has been having trouble with hitting when he feels frustrated.

I‚Äôm just too tired to concentrate on organizing everything so I just let it be and supervise off the corner of my eye. Sometimes she will take a lipstick and I show her how I do mine and joke by pretending to put some on her. She is most interested in opening and closing it. Also I have perfumes on a tray near the sink which I let her smell. I try to teach her not to put near her nose too much. And to be careful with them since they are encapsulated in glass, still catching any possible accidents and discipline again and so forth. She likes taking the tops off mostly.

Help us discipline our possibly adhd/spd/anxious son?,Parenting,7,dexzpj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dexzpj/help_us_discipline_our_possibly_adhdspdanxious_son/,15,1570558640.0,"How would you handle this?

Our son has gone off the rails.  He started kindergarten a month ago and got dismissed from the school (private) because of violent behavior towards teachers.  That violent behavior is now present at home.  We don‚Äôt know where to put him in school because we worry he will just be kicked out again.  Also, our local public schools are notoriously bad.

We also had a baby four days ago.

Our kid is not fully neurotypical but we are still working on figuring out exactly what.  Pediatrician thinks adhd and anxiety and we started adderall a month ago, which seems to help him pretty obviously.  But the anxiety piece is still clearly there.  He also has dyspraxia, a motor coordination disorder.  Caregivers have been flagging him as different since he was a toddler.

Right now his behavior is insane.  He refuses to do things, then runs his mouth, throws things or is violent if he doesn‚Äôt get what he wants.  He will rage in his room while in time out for literally an hour.  He worries about everything - will not walk down to the playground because he is worried about getting run over.  Worries something bad will happen to his stuffed animals.

My wife and my mom think we should go scorched earth with this type of plan:

1) ‚Äúschool at home‚Äù (while we look for another school for him): all toys and books disappear each night, he gets them back upon completion of the school day we design for him (say, 3-4 hours of school).

2) no tolerance to violence: violent or threatening behavior loses all books and toys, literally all, until the next day.

3) continue with 123 magic regardless of punishment status - instant time outs for violence / threats.

I am worried about this plan because it is so absolute - once he receives the punishment there‚Äôs no incentive to behave for the rest of the day.  It also requires us to put up with him for the rest of the day when punished: with the new baby here as well.

I am also worried because we don‚Äôt know how much of this behavior is related to neuro / psych issues and how much is him playing us like fools.

We are so stressed and tired.  Any insight or similar situations would be incredibly helpful.","Help us discipline our possibly adhd/spd/anxious son?How would you handle this?

Rewards, consequences, nothing works with them. My daughter was in therapy a year ago and we stopped because all the therapist could recommend was rewards. Now we're trying another one...

They're adopted, who knows what their birthparents' mental health was like, but their biological brother (also adopted) is very strong willed as well.

I feel the need to add some background to this- the twins were born at 25 weeks gestation and have had delays their entire life. We also think they are on the spectrum (we are on the waiting list to get them tested). They are in a great classroom and I like their teachers.

But here is my issue. One of the teachers in the room next to my kids classroom goes to church with my grandfather (small town issues). His wife, my step grandmother, has brain cancer and breast cancer. My grandparents were not a huge part of my life, my dad oded when I was young and wasn't part of my life before that. My entire life the only time they were involved in my life was whenever I reached out first. Also, last time I went to see my grandparents was in August and they didn't ask about my kids and talked about her great grandkids nonstop. Then I was told by someone that my step grandmother said not very kind things about my twins.

Okay, so back to the daycare teacher- today I was walking down the hall to pick the twins up and she stops me and ask if I was still working at _____ and I told her no but that I had been working at _____ , I was being friendly. Then she has the nerve to tell me that my grandfather's wife isn't doing well and questioned me the last time I went and saw them. She was a complete bitch to me. She also said more, I was in shock i don't think i even comprehended what she said. 

So obviously what she did was out of line. My family disfunction has nothing to do with her. Should I go see my grandparents- idk. But I know it's not her place to tell me I need to. 

Should I tell the daycare director or should I just drop it and avoid the teacher? What would you do?

I definitely see a receptive delay where he doesn't fully comprehend some things i tell him or others. But i just don't see autism in him. He looks completely normal! If he could just comprehend & speak clearly you wouldn't even be able to tell he has anything. Now I'm not trying to sound in denial or ignorant but it's really how i feel about it but i keep getting told otherwise. I'm very open minded & willing to accept facts when its clearly in my face. 

While raising him I'll admit i was a shit parent because i did nothing to teach him things as i was going through an extreme amount of stress. My son was basically raised being enclose inside an apartment with not much interaction which i feel had a big effect on him. 

I just want my son to be ok & live a normal life. Any advice on this? I feel like I'm not getting proper answers for him."

I have been sleeping on the floor of her bedroom, and this morning I wake up and am watching her sleep and all of a sudden she rolls over in her swaddle. So obviously we are done with swaddling her with her arms in. I have no idea what to do now. We have tried wearing mitts, but she still wakes herself up with rubbing. Also, we have tried special soaps and lotions in case she was rubbing due to sensitivity, but nothing has worked.

She started at 2 with terrible temper tantrums where her dad would physically have to hold her in his lap with his arms around her to keep her from destroying her surroundings. It has gradually escalated. 

It‚Äôs like she has 2 personalities. She‚Äôs one way at her dads house, and one way at my house.

Tonight she was told to brush her teeth and she stomped off and pouted. I told her I was taking away her iPad and phone and she simply said, ‚Äúok‚Äù. I currently have a list of chores that she is to do in the morning with a cheerful attitude.

4 Month Old Sleep: The Depths of Despair,Parenting,2,dey8sf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dey8sf/4_month_old_sleep_the_depths_of_despair/,6,1570560399.0,"Short but sweet here! 
My four month old daughter does not have a consistent sleep schedule, and wakes during the night multiple times and cannot self soothe. I am so sleep deprived and frustrated with the crying and whining, I am seriously wishing that I could win the lottery and have 24 hour a day help. I‚Äôve dreamt about it. Twice. 
This is my first and last child... I initially thought I wanted two, but I can‚Äôt do this again. No, I won‚Äôt change my mind.
She is starting daycare in two weeks, and the daycare promised to help establish a firm schedule (for $2,000 per month, they had better). I also retained a sleep consultant, we are beginning 10/20.
Until then, can anyone please provide a short list of proven sleep solutions?
The main issue is: wakes twice during the middle of the night, is starving. Eats a little, then will NOT go back to sleep. Sometimes she falls asleep in our arms, but once placed back into the crib (we bend all the way and hold her tight to our chest while placing her), she immediately flails and starts whining. Rinse and repeat for about 3 hours.
It is pitch black in her room, correct temperature, sound machine (you get the idea). I‚Äôve tried a ‚Äúwedge‚Äù to prop her up because she likes the car seat. She also likes walking, but I refuse to start putting her in the stroller at 3:00am and taking a stroll around the block in the NYC winter.
She is fed before bed if she wants it, and usually takes it.
She is a tall baby, about 27‚Äù and 17 pounds.
I‚Äôve tried every single swaddle (magic Merlin, love to dream, halo), nothing helps.
Bedtime routine as follows: bath, stories, bed.
I feel like I‚Äôve tried EVERYTHING. I know she won‚Äôt go to college like this... but maybe she will.

My 4 year old son is developing an unhealthy friendship,Parenting,12,deqzt7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/deqzt7/my_4_year_old_son_is_developing_an_unhealthy/,20,1570516480.0,"My 4 year old is a very sweet boy. He found himself a best friend in pre-school a year and half ago and the two have been inseparable since then. But, unfortunately, my child is making his own life uncomfortable at the hands of his best friend. The other kid while sweet on many occasions, is also exhibiting an unmistakable mean streak and more often than not, it's my child that's at the receiving end. It upsets him to no end that his ""best friend"" is being mean; he follows him around crying and demands an apology. I suspect that my child's desperation is giving this other kid some kind of a power trip because not only does he refuse to apologize, he justifies his bad behavior. 

The aggravating thing is that my child gets into this type of situation with only this ""best friend"". He is pretty assertive with all his other friends. I don't want my child to internalize that abuse comes along for the ride in special relationships. I have been teaching him that best friends are never mean. I'm not sure it has registered to him. It almost seems like he'd rather have the comfort of friendship than confront his friend about his horrible behavior.

Because these two kids picked out each other as best friends, as parents, me and wife have become good friends with the other kid's parents. They are really good people and they do their best to discipline the rouge kid, but his bad behavior persists. For instance, yesterday, my wife was baby-sitting these two kids and they got into an accident during play time; my child tried to reach for a toy his friend was holding, and his friend refused to hand it to him and swung the toy away and ended up hitting my kid on his face. My child got a scratch below his eye and it started to bleed slightly, but more importantly to him, his friend didn't apologize and it made him all the more miserable :( I heard the crying and ran inside to see my wife comforting my child and asking his best friend to apologize to put the matter to rest. My jaw dropped when this other kid said he didn't mean it and that my child grabbed the toy and hence he didn't have to  apologize. 

My first instinct was to call this other kid's parents and ask them to come get their kid right away, but once I calmed down I decided against it because I didn't want to lose their friendship. I also haven't yet thought about the best way to approach this topic with them.

this morning, we woke up minutes after the nurse left to see our baby in the crib with two blankets on (not the swaddles we specifically always use and in a certain way so the fabric is never above shoulders and is always snug. well, this AM we were shocked to not only see blankets in the crib, but our baby was completely covered (her face was) by the blankets. my wife happened to wake up out of nowhere because her intuition told her to check on the baby. we are thanking God because she walked in to see the blankets over the baby‚Äôs face. the baby is fine and hadn‚Äôt been struggling to breathe yet, but we all know the horror stories.

so, we are deeply concerned, of course. at first we thought we were overreacting but now processing this we realize, wow, that is pretty much the worst thing a night nurse could do, and it should be obvious that newborns and blankets in the crib don‚Äôt mix.

this morning, we woke up minutes after the nurse left to see our baby in the crib with two blankets on (not the swaddles we specifically always use and in a certain way so the fabric is never above shoulders and is always snug. well, this AM we were shocked to not only see blankets in the crib, but our baby was completely covered (her face was) by the blankets. my wife happened to wake up out of nowhere because her intuition told her to check on the baby. we are thanking God because she walked in to see the blankets over the baby‚Äôs face. the baby is fine and hadn‚Äôt been struggling to breathe yet, but we all know the horror stories.

so, we are deeply concerned, of course. at first we thought we were overreacting but now processing this we realize, wow, that is pretty much the worst thing a night nurse could do, and it should be obvious that newborns and blankets in the crib don‚Äôt mix.

1.	we are firing the service and letting them know we won‚Äôt have them by again
2.	is that an overreaction? or an under reaction? meaning, should we also report this person to the businesses‚Äô owner? we don‚Äôt want to hurt her livelihood and she has been great so far and we like her but we can‚Äôt imagine this kind of negligence happening again.

what would you do fellow parents?"

I bit my tongue at those comments. He came to me yesterday and said that she has asked him several more times when he will be getting a haircut. 
   He is confused why his teacher cares so much about his hair, as am I, and doesn‚Äôt really know how to respond to her. 

   I have told him to tell her that if she has any more questions about his hair she can come to me. 
   Is there any advice that anyone has?

Four year old written up for insubordination.

The complaint from the teacher is that he often refuses directions in favor of doing his own activities. The directions he refuses are things like coming to sit at story time, at the craft table, and so on. He‚Äôd rather continue playing with his blocks or at worst, pouts with his arms crossed in the corner or drops to the floor and just lays there. He is not the best with expressing himself verbally.  He‚Äôs not hyperactive or violent, he just wants to do his own thing. 

I get this can be frustrating and it‚Äôs not uncommon behavior for him. We‚Äôre struggling with his stubbornness at home right now, too, on top of him waking up several time a night since school started last month, so he‚Äôs also exhausted and extra cantankerous. He doesn‚Äôt like doing crafts or sitting during group storytime. He‚Äôs a picky eater and often refuses the snack. I get there are rules and routine, but I feel I pay the preschool to help me teach him the rules and routine, no matter how frustrating he can get, without the threat of a write up (they‚Äôre suspended after three write ups, kicked out after four) for a four year old laying on the floor and refusing to do the craft.

Last year when he was in the 3s class he had the same teacher. During the Christmas performance he refused to put on the hat and tried to hide behind his teacher because he was shy and nervous. The teacher got very frustrated with him and yelled loudly and angrily during the performance ‚Äú(his name), go sit with mom!‚Äù I don‚Äôt take the attitude that my kid is a perfect angel. I have always been very receptive and open to any concerns over his behavior, but that incident was the first time my mom spidey sense tingled that something isn‚Äôt right about the whole situation.

Today as I was walking into pick up, one of the assistant teachers, who has been very nice to me in the past, was very short with me, treating me noticeably different than she has in the past and as she did the other parents she was interacting with today. i knew something was up at that point. It left a very bad taste in my mouth because if she felt it was appropriate to be that cold and short with me, how does she treat my son?

As soon as the lead teacher saw me she immediately launched into a tirade (in front of all the other parents) about how he has been written up for laying on the floor today and refusing to participate. She was very hyper, I almost felt like she was barking at me. I told her I would talk with him about his behavior. 

I got into the car, but I began to mull over what just happened. I walked back in and requested a meeting with the teacher.

How would you handle this meeting? Does it sound like the teachers were out of line? I want my son to feel loved and wanted, even when he‚Äôs being difficult. He is only four.

On the last play of practice my son(7yrs old)ran toward the sideline and got tackled no different than anytime before and got up and both the bones in his lower left arm were broken. At first I thought he was crying because he got bumped and cried like little kids will but as soon as I saw it I knew it was broken. We took him to the hospital and he was so brave and strong. It was amazing to see. The whole time we are there though, I have never felt so helpless. It hurts me in ways I never knew could hurt to see my kids get injured. 

How do other parents deal with their kids getting injured? 

For any parent dealing with more than a simple broken arm I‚Äôm so sorry you and your child are suffering.

Recently the wife and I have been pretty exhausted, because the dinner bath and bed routine with our 16 month old is getting to be less manageable as he gets older.

By the time we get to eventually sit down, it‚Äôs 9pm and it‚Äôs usually straight to bed üòÇ

We‚Äôre not messy people, and our house is tidy, doing chores whenever we have spare time, but after work is really the only ‚Äúfamily time‚Äù we get together.

Hard hit to the face followed by uncontrollable giggling from him. Nobody has taught him this either. 

He also has been screaming. Loudly..For no reason. Not crying. Just screaming and laughing. 

Lastly, he still wakes up 3 times to eat.  And chokes on little bitty food pieces I give him like eggs, rice, or puffs or yogurt bits. He has 2 bottom teeth and he has 3 top ones all coming in at the same time. I‚Äôm trying to get him to eat more through the day and sleep at night. 

Doctor said he is meeting all his milestones, he‚Äôs about to walk, and his heights and weight are good.

Some disorientation, headaches, vomiting, a trip to urgent care followed by the ER, and a clear CT later we were left to go home and told, among other things, to keep him home from school and follow up with his Pediatrician in a day or two.    


This is where it gets infuriating.  My wife lost her job about a year ago and with it our health insurance.  In order to have access to health care for our son we started to enroll him in a clinic in our town which specializes in offering assistance to those without insurance.  It's not a free clinic associated with a medical center or anything like that.  It's a regular doctor's office who is well known for being the best at finding a way to get people access to healthcare.  We started the enrollment process with them because that was their advice, filled out some paperwork etc, to see what could be done.   Partway through they figured out we were eligible for a free insurance program through the state that his old doctor accepts.  We called the old doctors office and verified with them that they accept it an he could stay as a patient with the new insurance and never finished the enrollment at the new place.  I just called up the office to schedule the followup and was informed me that they listed him as having transferred to the new doctor and they aren't accepting new patients so we cannot be seen there, period.  I called the place we started to fill out the paperwork, but they don't have his records and won't see him as a new patient until he has a well visit first, which of course we cannot do because he isn't well.    


So, we have no doctor to follow up with and all I really want to do right now is strangle somebody.  I'm going to keep calling pediatric offices until someone takes pity on me or, barring that go back to urgent care on Tuesday.

While I want to intervene and speak with the teachers, I feel that he's going to have to learn how to deal with things like this in life and i would like him to learn how to figure it out while he is still in a relatively safe environment like school (dealing with relatively harmless kids). Other kids seem fine saying no and pushing back, and are not as fearful when they are harrassed.

While I want to intervene and speak with the teachers, I feel that he's going to have to learn how to deal with things like this in life and i would like him to learn how to figure it out while he is still in a relatively safe environment like school (dealing with relatively harmless kids). Other kids seem fine saying no and pushing back, and are not as fearful when they are harrassed.

Lately I have been thinking about how hard it is for me to relax, and I think I have processed out that a lot of what I used to do befe kids to relax was house projects and/or unstructured time around the house, which have all but disappeared since having kids.

Weekends are filled with family time, but even when my wife is managing the kids they take up the whole space. After bed time is a nice time, but then I have to be quiet and I only have the energy to stay up 90-120 minutes after they're asleep.

The other day work was quiet, so my boss encouraged me to work from home, but I spent whole the day bouncing between coffee shops and the library knowing that at home the kids are going to be all up in my business.

I would like to take a day or two off from work for a little staycation to recharge my batteries, but I am not sure what I would do, as the kids are at home nearly all the time.

I love them deeply, and have so much fun hanging with them, but need some time/space to recharge, and I am having trouble finding that. Has anyone else experienced something similar? Any advice on what to do?","Advice for how to relax when kids are always at home?Father to a four and one year old.

First time poster here.

I‚Äôve had my sweet boy for 12 years. Having no children up until recently, I‚Äôve always thought of him as precious to me as a human child would be. I‚Äôd sing to him, dance with him, and in general, loved him to pieces.  I‚Äôve been so lucky to have him. 

Fast forward to today. I have a 3 month old baby girl. As I‚Äôm sure all parents experience, she has completely changed my world in the best way possible, and I love her more than anyone or anything, more than my cat . I could go on and on about how much we love her, but she‚Äôs not the subject of this post. 

My sweet boy has recently started pooping all over the house...always soft surfaces like beds, furniture and rugs. He has done this before when he‚Äôs been stressed, such as when we got a second cat and when we moved across the country. Ive always just cleaned it up. I never have punished him in any way, not even got angry at him. I‚Äôve taken him to the vet and there‚Äôs nothing physiological causing this behavior. I think he just feels neglected with the new baby getting a lot of attention.

I‚Äôve tried a lot of stuff like CBD oil, comfort zone plug ins, extra love and attention, citrus sprays to deter him (cats don‚Äôt like citrus), etc. Nothing is helping 

My baby girl isn‚Äôt mobile yet of course, but she will be soon, and I‚Äôm terrified she will get into cat feces. We clean it up as soon as we see it of course, but what if she gets there before we do?

I don‚Äôt know what to do! I don‚Äôt want to give up on him but I also need to keep my daughter safe.","Pet Cat Possibly Endangering Infant

Question About Daycare vs Stay Home Involving Toddler and Newborn.,Parenting,2,depfgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/depfgt/question_about_daycare_vs_stay_home_involving/,19,1570509721.0,"I have a 2 year old son, who will be exactly 2.5 years old when his little brother is born. I will be taking maternity leave for 12 months. 

I'm having a hard time deciding whether to keep my older son home with us or whethet to keep him going to daycare at maybe 2 days a week. Here is my pro and con lists so far:

PRO Daycare:

- We have no family or friends in our city, so after my husband goes back to work, it'll just be me and the two kids alone. I won't be able to give either kid the attention they are used to/deserves.

- My oldest son is ACTIVE. I've had days at home with him (I work part time in office and part time from home) where I've tried to keep him home while I finished up chores, he usually only makes it to noon before he's bouncing off the walls and we have to go to a park. I don't use screens to entertain him as I've learned the hard way that even just half an hour of Blippi or even Khan Academy Kids will give him the ""post video game adrenaline rush"", so I don't use screens for him at all now. 

- My son enjoys going to daycare. He has friends there. It's also become his routine and he's learning better there because it's a group environment. 

AGAINST Daycare:

- The biggest concern is obviously him catching bugs and bringing them home to the newborn. We're a very cuddly family overall so I do expect that we won't be able to avoid newborn getting sick somehow by either direct contact with his brother or contact with me/dad after we've had contact with older son. My older son literally did not get sick until he went into daycare at 8 months. By then he was old enough for it to not be so miserable on him or on us. 

- Despite him enjoying daycare, if anybody asked my son whether he wants to go to ""school"" or hang out with mum all day, he still chooses mum. Mini Pro Daycare: But I suspect that might change once he realises that mum can no longer do fun stuff with him all day (we literally play all day when I get a whole day with him now). His newborn brother is gonna have me strapped to a nursing chair every couple of hours, so our adventure times are pretty much over for a while until baby brother can crawl/walk. 

- We do have the option to have a ""mum's helper"" (a baby sitter that comes by for a couple of hours to help me out while we're at home) come a couple of days a week. This person can probably take my older one out to the park for an afternoon here and there. Mini Pro Daycare argument: Daycare costs are still subsidized here even when I'm on mat leave, so I'd be paying less costs in daycare to have my son there for whole days while in-home care is not subsidized, meaning the mum's helper who would only be here for half days a couple days a week would end up costing more than (2x the amount) whole day daycare for the same amount of days a week. 

Over all I feel selfish for leaning towards keeping son in daycare, as it looks like I'm just trying to make things easier for myself. My oldest not getting to play outside as much as he's used to though (even at 7 months pregnant now, I take him outside to the beach or the park at least once a day and sometimes twice a day) is a huge concern of mine. And him losing that social interaction at daycare is a concern as well. When we go to parks he's usually so happy if there are other toddlers there to play with. 

And a question I have for parents with multiple children who've had to make this choice before: what did you end up doing? If you kept the older in daycare, did your newborn get sick all the time? If you kept the older home, what did you do to entertain them while still nursing the newborn?

We asked if he wanted to play this fall, and he said yes so we signed him up again. It's like night and day - he cries, whines, and basically will just stand there. Literally no amount of bribary, begging, or asking what's wrong will budge him. He stubbornly only does it when he wants. Which is frustrating for us bc he says he wants to play then he does not once we actually get to the field. 

I understand he's almost 4 but every other child on the team participates except mine. (All of the kids are about the same age, none of them knew each other prior to this season.)  I don't know what to do. Is it ""lol he's 4"" or is it ""he's got an issue"" - I'm so at a loss.

Son's Birthday Party (Low RSVP Count),Parenting,2,den8yx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/den8yx/sons_birthday_party_low_rsvp_count/,7,1570500545.0,"Hi everyone!

We recently moved to a new town and my son wanted to invite his (kindergarten) classmates to his birthday party (which occurs next Saturday). Our new place isn't big enough for more than a couple kids and with the uncertainty surrounding mid October weather, we opted to find an indoor facility.

I surveyed some parents and despite this Saturday being a long weekend, the response was very positive in terms of availability and willingness to join the celebration. So we booked a venue (which unfortunately isn't cheap, but that part is beside the point in this case, because we agreed to do it).

""All of his friends"" have told him that they will be coming. He's named about 10 of them. However, the reality is only 3 parents have rsvp'd yes, some have rsvp'd no, and the majority have neither responded to my email (or last night's follow up email) or viewed the electronic invitation. I'm concerned he will have fewer than rsvp'd yes actually show up, because that's what tends to happen in my experience, as last minute things come up for people.

Any advice on how to head this off and temper my son's expectations? The money spent and parents (hopefully well intentioned) inability to make it after originally giving the thumbs up is not my son's responsibility and I want to make sure he doesn't feel like his friends abandoned him. He's at the age that promises mean the world (do you blame him?) And he is very sensitive to what he interprets as a broken promise.

Thanks in advance.","Son's Birthday Party (Low RSVP Count)Hi everyone!

My wife and I have an awesome daughter and for the past 6 months my mother-in-law has been driving to our house to take care of the baby while we're at work. She's not old enough to retire and she quit her job to take on this role. We pay her slightly more than what we would pay for daycare. Unfortunately, there have been multiple times this year where she has texted us while we're getting ready for work to say she can't make it that day (shingles, migraines, urinary tract infection, etc.). This has caused a ton of anxiety for both me and my wife as we're being forced to call out from work with short notice in addition to paying my mother-in-law for that day. 

We're now trying to decide if we'd be better off having our daughter in daycare. I feel guilty because our daughter loves her grandmother and lights up when she comes in the door. My mother-in-law is also great with our daughter and takes care of a lot of the household chores while the baby naps. I know that my daughter won't get the amount of attention there as she does at home which kind of bums me out, but I also think she might benefit developmentally by being around other kids.

Toddler Boys hugging my daughter,Parenting,0,den739,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/den739/toddler_boys_hugging_my_daughter/,28,1570500323.0,"Probably shoulda wrote, Kid boys hugging my daughter.

Happened today, and find myself evaluating if I'm being ridiculous or not. Figured why not seek out other parental advice?

I went to pick up my 4-year-old daughter from school and as she was putting on her backpack, 3 boys jumped up to go in and hug her saying ""Hug me, hug me!"". She just froze and stood there and didn't say or do anything. I gently blocked two of the boys from hugging her and said, ""She's putting on her backpack, no hugging please."". While I was paying attention to the two, another one got in there before I could prevent him. I had a quick snap of thought to pull him away from her, but stopped myself and allowed it to happen. It felt very uncomfortable for me, but I have no idea how my daughter felt about it.

One of the kids snapped to me and said: ""You're not my daddy or my mommy, shut up"". Told the kid to get out of here, but admittedly had the thought to toss him across the room. Lil' shit.

Overall, I guess I'm wondering if I'm overthinking this thing or not. I don't want my daughter hugging boys in the class and letting kids invade her personal space because she doesn't know how or understand that it's okay to reject. I wonder if she even cares, or thinks anything of it at all. My wife agrees that she's uncomfortable by it, and we've tried telling her that it's okay to say no to hugs. What is the general consensus to this thing? I get that the boys are too young to place any sexual connotation to the action. Maybe it's my being an adult placing the act of an unsolicited hug in a negative light? I probably wouldn't care if a little girl hugged her, so it's definitely about it being a little boy. Now I wonder if the teacher is allowing this during the day? Should I talk to her? All I know is that it made me feel uncomfortable at the moment, and I don't want random boys putting their hands on my kid.","Toddler Boys hugging my daughterProbably shoulda wrote, Kid boys hugging my daughter.

Stressing myself silly - skin rash,Parenting,3,dehfx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dehfx0/stressing_myself_silly_skin_rash/,15,1570471869.0,"Let me start off by saying clearly: I am taking her to the doctor first thing tomorrow morning (its 8pm at night here right now), regardless of any responses I get here so Im not asking for medical advice. But I am 25 weeks pregnant and my stress levels are through the roof and I just need to talk to other parents. 

Last monday my 2.5 year old had some mild cold symptoms, runny nose, mild fever and she had conjunctivitis, cough here and there but not persistent. She was better by Thursday. Saturday night I noticed she had a few red bumps on her shoulders. I thought it was just heat rash because its been really hot here the last few days. The next day I could find anything on her so I dismissed it. Tonight bathing her I noticed the rash on her shoulders is back and has gotten worse. Large red splotches made up of smaller bumps. It doesnt seem to bother her at all. But she has been acting funny the last few days, extra whiny, needy, lots of attitude. But I just thought thats normal ‚Äúterrible twos‚Äù mood swings. 

Of course dr google has made me stress about measles. And the hormones are driving normal stress into ‚Äúpalpitations and dizziness‚Äù levels of stress. She is fully vaccinated too. 

Someone tell me I can calm down for now and that the dr will get to the bottom of it tomorrow. Or the opposite and tell me I‚Äôm right to stress. Im driving myself crazy here.

Edit: this morning there was no sign of the rash and she seemed 100% like her usual self. Thanks for all the responses!

‚ñ™Ô∏é we lost our previouus dog not too long ago and we're really missing that connection

‚ñ™Ô∏é our daughter absolutely loves dogs- totally obsessed with dogs. She has had interactions with other dogs recently but only for short periods of time. 

My only hesitation is that I have a 2 year old. She's a good child, not anymore rowdy than your average 2 year old. We've been working on how to pet doggies, to be gentle, where their no- no spots are (ears, tails, butts, and privates) and she's doing well. 

So here are my questions: 

Have you gotten a puppy with a toddler? 
How did they do together?

We are looking at German shepherds because that is what my fiance is familiar with. I've done a lot of research on it and they are one of the top most dog friendly breeds so thatis comforting. 

Does anyone have any experience with that specific breed?

I've told her that we have debts in the bank, at my work and with my mother (about USD 7K in total) and that her job (at a private school) only gets a scholarship for 2 children (where I live, public education is a no go). For the third child we would have to pay full tuition, which would leave us in more debt.

She does all the finances on the house, I give her all the money I earn and keeps her earnings to later spend it on the house, services, kids, my share, etc. I have no problem with that at all, thats how we work and I trust her with that 100%.

We currently have two jobs each and can barely (in my impression, because sometimes at the end of the month we have no money and have to get money from wherever we can to pay services, etc.) support our lifestyle.

*My jobs are 9 to 5, and 8 to midnight, so I can be with my kids from 6 to 8 and all weekend, her jobs are 7 to 4 and saturdays, so I don't think we spend as much time as we should with the kids*

So... I told her that if she wanted another kid, all debts would have to be gone, and we should have at least 1k in the bank in savings so I could be at peace and agree with her.

Today she brought the ""do you want a baby brother/sister?"" to the kids, which I didn't really appreciate, but  brushed it off as something  childish. I reminded her of the conditions I had to have another kid and she asked me ""Why do I have to do everything? Why do I have to pay the debts and get the savings?"" to which I answered ""Because YOU are the one who wants another kid!""... well apparently that was not the correct answer, she flipped out, and told me that she might aswell find it elsewhere!

I kind of feel awful right now, I'm at my home but feel a heartache... I don't know what to do.

**TL;DR:** Have anybody been in this situation? where you're not totally opposed to having another kid, but you KNOW you're not going to be able to support your current lifestyle and don't want it just for that reason? is it a valid reason not to want another kid?

First time mum here. My son is 15 weeks old and his feeding has changed in the past week.

I try to change positions around, which works for a couple more minutes. I try stopping to burp him and start again, which again, works for a couple of minutes. I try changing breasts.

Is this normal behaviour for breastfeeding as time goes on? I suspect he‚Äôs going through a developmental leap at the moment, so I‚Äôm sure his inquisitive nature is somewhat responsible, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs entirely to blame.

How to handle jealousy,Parenting,5,dee5kp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dee5kp/how_to_handle_jealousy/,2,1570448772.0,"So I was an intensely jealous kid. I always chalked that up to being a second (and unplanned) child.

In all seriousness, thought, too much jealousy is not a good thing. It really held me back in my childhood and teens; I don‚Äôt want my kid to struggle like I did.

So it came as a a bit of a shock for me and her father when SD called and told him she had the door removed because she slammed it and yeah. My husband tried asking more but the mother quickly told her she was out of time and couldn‚Äôt speak anymore and cut the call. Now, I‚Äôve been a teen And also the daughter of divorced parents and I get that she calls to tests her moms rules and role by calling my husband. But when he called to ask if all is ok she didn‚Äôt answer and just texted that all was fine.

But it‚Äôs been some time now that the kids have all their phone calls with my husband always on speaker phone. And we‚Äôve been getting some off comments about the partner of their mother and how he treats them and what not. 

Now I know kids, specially entering puberty can be dramatic and stretch out the truth but am I crazy to think that taking off the door is a bit too much?! Like is this normal? I come from a Latino family and this wasn‚Äôt the case at all. I just don‚Äôt know and neither does my husband. So my question; is taking off a door because slamming normal? At 10?!

Caught my 12 year old having cybersex,Parenting,25,de4fli,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/de4fli/caught_my_12_year_old_having_cybersex/,32,1570403311.0,"Throwaway Account.

I don‚Äôt even know where to begin. My 12 year old son came out as bisexual the other day. We were supportive of his decision and gave him no grief at all. We let him know that nothing about anything has changed and he can be attracted to whomever he pleases.

My son has a bad habit of sneaking on his phone and devices after he‚Äôs supposed to be in bed. I get alerts when his phone is on, and last night it pinged at 1am, way past his bedtime. 

I snuck downstairs to see what he was doing, but he had apparently heard me and had placed the phone on his desk and played dumb when I asked him why he was on it. Upon touching the phone, I could tell by its warmth that it was recently on, at which point he fessed up to being on it. I scolded him a bit, and told him his phone was mine for the time being.

In what might go down as my biggest mistake thus far in life, I opened his phone to find some GRAPHIC pictures from a google search for ‚Äòmicropenises‚Äô... dumbfounded I told him that his phone was gone for good, and that he knew why. He apologized and laid back down.

Now, my kid ARGUES. I found it really strange he didn‚Äôt have anything to say to attempt to vindicate himself, and that prompted me to dig deeper on the phone. Within a few seconds of searching I found a discord chat he was in which included an hours long sexting session that went way beyond the norm. The other party was very domineering but also calling my son ‚Äòdaddy‚Äô and other unmentionable shit that still has my stomach turned.

I looked even further and realized that he is in a bunch of servers that are for roleplay and cybersex. Needless to say, I‚Äôm still in shock. Prior to this, the worst he had done on his phone was look up ‚Äòboobs‚Äô on YouTube, now he‚Äôs engaging in conversations with what could very well be adults.

I grew up on AIM, Yahoo Messenger, Limewire, etc. I know full well how depraved the internet can be, especially towards younger children and creepy ass adults. Hell, I‚Äôd be lying if I didn‚Äôt say that I used to absolutely defile my parents computer growing up. My parents were just never savvy enough to catch me.


I‚Äôm at a complete loss at what to do here. I know that he‚Äôs going through a lot of changes and trying to find his identity, but I can‚Äôt just look the other way when potential grown men are sexting my son. 

I‚Äôm less concerned about legal recourse against the other parties as I am finding the least damaging way to deal with this with my son. He‚Äôs obviously punished and has no phone or computer for a LONG time, but I‚Äôm not even sure to have a conversation with him about this.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

She has started to wake up in the middle of the night about 3 or 4 hours into the night screaming at the top of her lungs that she is hungry.

If we deny her food and we just offer a drink she will only continue to cry she is hungry. When you walk away she then says she is thirsty since that is what you offered. After that she has been biting her cheek (I think because of how tired she is) and crying about the immense pain. She will do this process for hours. Unfortunately we have a 4 month old she like to wake up with this act. We have tried ignoring what she wants and just cradling her and rocking her but then she just cry‚Äôs she is lonely once she calms down and we put her to bed.

Dealing with a 3 year old who is/thinks she is the boss,Parenting,5,de9r7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/de9r7a/dealing_with_a_3_year_old_who_isthinks_she_is_the/,7,1570426349.0,"My daughter is 3 and a half and generally brilliant. She is polite and kind and funny. But she is sooooo stubborn and it seems to make it really tough for us not to let her get her way all the time.

For example, as I write this it's quarter past ten at night and she is still awake - she is usually asleep by quarter to eight. The reason she is still awake is because she decided she wanted to go to sleep in our bed tonight (which she has done maybe 5 or 6 times in the past year when she has been ill for instance) and we said no and enforced this. This resulted in tantrums, hitting, arguments about the lights being on (she says she is scared of the dark), several 'essential' trips to the toilet and a general refusal to even attempt to go to sleep in her room. I think we coped with it fairly well at first but after an hour and a half I resorted to shouting and threats to turn all the lights off and make her sleep in the dark (which I regret now and feel pretty shitty about :( - needless to say it only made things worse).  


This is one example, but another example was the other day when we had cooked banana cake in the day together. We had said she could have some after she had finished her dinner. She flat out refused to even try the dinner - to which we tried to make it not a big deal with 'ok, that's fine - you can go and play then but no dinner - no cake'. At this she had a meltdown and refused to try her dinner but also refused to get down from the table demanding cake - for maybe just over an hour. She never did get any cake and eventually just wandered off to watch telly or something - but that hour and a bit was stressful.  
Basically anytime we tell her she can't do something she really wants to do, she pretty much just ignores us and trys to do it anyway and if we really enforce it she has an absolute meltdown and there seems to be no reasoning with her. Her stubbornness is so strong that it can feel like the impasse is never going to end.   


I'm not sure the best way to approach this - or if there even is a best way? Maybe it's just her age and all kids are a bit like this (she is our first so we don't have much experience in this regard). But it can be pretty demoralising and depressing as I just want to have fun with her and don't want to spend hours at a time in a battle.","Dealing with a 3 year old who is/thinks she is the bossMy daughter is 3 and a half and generally brilliant.

He constantly beats us by smacking us in the face or anywhere possible. Recently he learnt how to punch. A few days ago he punched me in the eye so hard I started tearing up and it was swollen for a while. That eye hurt for 2 days. 

I‚Äôm shocked at how strong he is but I guess it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs very active and full of energy 24/7. We don‚Äôt even like taking him out because he wouldn‚Äôt sit on a trolley and would run around or scream while other families have well-behaved kids. Very frustrating. I don‚Äôt know where he gets the aggression from but I‚Äôm thinking the way his father plays rough with him may be a factor. They pretend fight each other and I always told him to stop playing too rough with our kid. Maybe he sees it on TV too? Maybe he‚Äôs bored at home? I don‚Äôt know. 

We scold him every time he hurts anyone but this has no effect and he doesn‚Äôt care. When he throws tantrums we don‚Äôt give in at all and let him finish. I‚Äôve tried speaking calm and nicely, it doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôve tried being ‚Äúangry‚Äù he‚Äôs unbothered.

I‚Äôm just fed up at this point since we‚Äôre already in a really bad situation and he adds up to my stress by being naughty. I know he‚Äôs still small and doesn‚Äôt understand cause and effect but I‚Äôm desperate. It doesn‚Äôt help that his dad‚Äôs mother would tell me to do something about it. I‚Äôm trying??? 

I already resent being a young mom sometimes and I‚Äôve been depressed about how my life changed since he was born. I have breakdowns every now and then but I‚Äôm trying so hard because he deserves to be loved and it wasn‚Äôt his choice to be brought into the world. 

I don‚Äôt even know how I feel because it‚Äôs just a mix of emotions. He‚Äôs a good boy, he understands a lot, knows how to ask for what he wants, and he‚Äôs also independent except the aggression is too much and he doesn‚Äôt listen when it comes to the bad things he does. He doesn‚Äôt hit other kids though but I‚Äôm worried he won‚Äôt get rid of his habit of hitting others and it would become worse in the future. 

I‚Äôm researching for books that could be helpful. I‚Äôm thinking maybe he should attend activities or have more interaction with other kids?

I did not try to keep them apart, but I honestly don't think I tried enough to bring them together.  I am far from the perfect parent.  

So, when he graduated high school (we lived in the Austin area), he was going to attend KU and I was going to move back to Kansas City, where my family lived.   I moved up to KC and he wanted to stay in Austin for a final summer with his friends, but would come to KC and move into the dorms in August.  He reluctantly agreed to stay with my ex, which I thought would be a good opportunity for them to spend some time together.  

So, a week after I moved, he called me and told me he decided not to go to KU and he was staying in Austin to go to community college.   I am sure his dad convinced him that this would be best.    I was pretty upset that day, but decided to suck it up and just tell him to do what he thought was right.    He has a girlfriend that also lives in Austin.   

So, he has been living with my ex and going to community college.  We text and I ask him about his classes and girlfriends, etc.  I read over all my texts several times to just make sure they aren't passive aggressive, but I feel like I have to walk on eggshells.  We used to be very close, but we aren't now.     He texted me that he wouldn't be up for Christmas, but that could come up after the new year.   I texted back "" I am disappointed, but will have to get solid dates from you as I can't always take off work after the new year.""  He told me I was being ridiculous and that I overreact to everything.  He told me to stop texting him.   I am just heart-broken.    I understand he is getting older and needs to have his own life, but I let him know that I expected to at least be a part of the conversation about the holiday trip.   I have to buy his ticket and I need to make sure I can be off work.     

He is my only child and I love him, but the last few months have been pretty miserable.  He is selfish.  He is disrespectful.   I sort of dread when I see him text me.   He is coming up on Thanksgiving, but I am not excited.  And that really makes me sad.   I just don't know exactly what to do.   I don't want to be some narcissistic parent, but I feel like he makes decisions without consulting me and then gets super angry when I say that might not work for me.  

I just don't know.  I am depressed about it.   I know this just sounds silly, but I don't know exactly how to manage a difficult 18 year old boy.  My ex just says he is 18 and that I should get over it.   I want to have a good relationship going forward, but I don't want to be a doormat.   How do you balance those things?  Any advice?

Tired. Depressed. Or both?,Parenting,1,ded4vl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/ded4vl/tired_depressed_or_both/,9,1570443140.0,"Now this will seem like a rant and that‚Äôs partially true but it‚Äôs to set the scene for my questions. 

I am a 33[m] married to my 34[f] wife for 4 years now and been together for 15 years total. So this way you know this isn‚Äôt a new relationship.  Our son is going to be 3 in two months time. Now you have our bio info. 

To jump back in time to pregnancy.  From the moment your doctor confirms you are pregnant a whole slew of things happen. But most importantly there is a network of doctors, nurses, midwives, technicians, friends, family, etc that are there to support you and make sure you and the unborn baby feel okay and are doing okay.  Once that baby is born.....that team you relied on for 9 months to help through every concern you had, every ounce of stress that was mitigated to put you at ease, your bank of knowledge that you could pull from day and night.......POOF......gone as fast as it came.  

Now you‚Äôre at home, with your partner, with your crying child and can‚Äôt figure out if he is hungry, tired, lonely, dirty diaper and your stress builds and builds until you start snapping at your partner and they are snapping back at you all the while creating this feedback loop of misery and fatigue.  Where is your help now????

You think ‚Äúoh I‚Äôll tell my mom friends who have been through this....they‚Äôll understand‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôll find an online support group of moms or parents in general...they‚Äôll understand‚Äù. While some groups, like this one, do understand, a lot of the time all you hear is ‚Äúwelcome to parenthood.‚Äù  These sane people that were asking you ‚Äúhow are you doing today?‚Äù And ‚Äú how is the unborn child today‚Äù or ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get an ultrasound to make sure the unborn child is fine‚Äù are now telling you to ‚Äúsuck it up buttercup‚Äù.  Like somehow your feelings don‚Äôt matter anymore just because the baby is now outside of you instead of inside of you. 

Now you and your partner hear these things over and over and over for days and days turn into weeks and weeks to months and finally almost 3 years have gone by and it seems nothing has changed.  You wake up at 7am because your son woke up before you and shook your pillow to wake you up. The day has started you think to yourself. But you are still tired. You got 8 hours of sleep though. You wake the wife up. She‚Äôs tired and doesn‚Äôt want to wake up so you are forced to figure out how to change the child, feed the child, let the dogs out, get showered, get breakfast for yourself and try to get some work done (work at home job) all the whole you have to remember to wake the wife up again. 

I make it into my office. I‚Äôm awake now and ready to work. Work day goes by and the 3 yo is coming and going in and out of my office up and down my lap sitting on my desk until finally my work day is done. But now......it‚Äôs 5:30. The wife asks what‚Äôs for dinner. I don‚Äôt know everything is frozen still. I get told that I should have pulled something out of the freezer this morning.  Apparently that‚Äôs also my job while the wife was playing with our son all day long. 

Nighttime routine for child comes around.  I take home to bed because if I relied on my wife the child would never have a schedule and he would go to bed at midnight instead of 8pm-9pm. I get him changed and into PJs and my wife comes in and hands him the toothbrush and leaves when he is done. It‚Äôs my job to sit with him until he falls asleep. 

Now I know if you are still reading this you‚Äôre thinking my wife wants very little to do with our son or being a good wife. While that may be true or it may not be that‚Äôs up for a couples counselor to decide. But I will say that my son is my shadow. Literally. I can‚Äôt walk from the living room to the kitchen without him asking me where I‚Äôm going or even following me. It‚Äôs the daddy show for sure. So even though my wife doesn‚Äôt put him to bed or get him up in the morning. It‚Äôs not because she doesn‚Äôt want to (maybe) it‚Äôs because our son won‚Äôt let her and wants me instead.  Psychoanalyze that however you want but that‚Äôs the long and short of it. 

My question is since I‚Äôm doing this same routine day in and day out I have the feeling of being tired ALL of the time. From when I wake up until I go to bed. Why am I so tired?  Is this depression?  Is depression causing the lack of ambition and tiredness.  Or am I just at that point in raising a child that makes you want to say ‚Äúscrew this. I‚Äôm going back to the circus where it‚Äôs quieter.‚Äù

Tl;dr. I can‚Äôt take a step without my son following me.  No time to myself. Always tired now possibly due to depression???","Tired. Depressed. Or both?Now this will seem like a rant and that‚Äôs partially true but it‚Äôs to set the scene for my questions.

Who is right about feeding our daughter?,Parenting,277,ddr1l8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/ddr1l8/who_is_right_about_feeding_our_daughter/,262,1570328438.0,"So I am looking for insight from other parents who may have been in similar situations with an infant or newborn. 

Our daughter graced this world with her presence about 8 weeks ago. Outside of not wanting to get rid of some lung fluid initially, she was super healthy and everything was great. Came home at 6 lbs 8 oz

My fianc√©e wanted to breastfeed. Which was great at first until the baby started to just NOT like the boob. Left boob is a hard no, right boob was okay sometimes, other times was an on off on off for hours. Doctor said it‚Äôs okay to pump and switch to a bottle, so we did. She still takes the boob occasionally but she prefers the bottle

Now here‚Äôs the current situation. Doctor gave us a chart showing how much she should be eating at what age. At 6 weeks, she should be around 2oz and be full. But that is not the case. Fianc√©es first daughter was formula only, would eat 2.5oz and pass out. This baby, not so much. Eat, spit it out, eat, doze off for a few minutes then wake up and want to still eat. At her 6 week checkup, I brought up to the doctor that 2oz isn‚Äôt enough for her. She can eat sometimes 3 and still be hungry. He says that 3 is the max, she should be eating it all and then falling asleep. He gave us another sheet to show us how to tell when the baby is hungry. 

Fine. I took the chart. She‚Äôs showing every. Single. Sign. Listed. All of them. She can eat 3 oz and show me every sign of still being hungry. But fianc√©e says we should try to listen to the doctor. So we tried it. And she would wake up, get her 2.5oz and then fuss and cry and squirm and cry for like an hour or so until she fell back asleep. For maybe 30 minutes and then would be on and off the boob until she was actually full. 

I was on complete dad duty one day as my fianc√©e was out with her mother. Baby was hungry. I put 3oz in the bottle. She downs it. She is still showing me signs that she is hungry. So I decided to make another 2oz bottle and see how that works instead of this whole fight and fuss and cry battle we have been doing. 

She ate another 1.5oz and was knocked out. Happy as a clam. Showed the signs that she was done eating, so I didn‚Äôt force her and I let her fall asleep. Fianc√©e came home and said ‚Äúdid you have a lot of trouble getting her to sleep?‚Äù  Said ‚Äúnope, I just fed her more‚Äù

Now cue the debate as to whether I‚Äôm harming her by over feeding her and yada yada yada. Convinced fianc√©e to give it a shot later in the day and now she‚Äôs slowly coming around but still unsure of whether we should be ‚Äúfeeding her so much‚Äù

If I say no he just tells me I‚Äôm keeping our son from him. Am I wrong for telling him no and that he needs to get his mom to help him take the baby to her place if he wants to see Him?"
When did co-parenting stop focusing on the kids?,Parenting,0,defxov,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/defxov/when_did_coparenting_stop_focusing_on_the_kids/,8,1570460549.0,"I am the father too two children.  One of them is from a one stand and the other is from my current relationship.  The child from my current relationship is not my biological child but the child's father has never been involved from the beginning.  I would like to ask two questions from my one night stand.  Both will be brief and end with questions this community.

1. Ho do i approach this with the mother and put an end to it? 

For the purpose of this post lets refer to my one night stand child as B.  B's mother is using our child to hurt me.  An example of this would be as follows.  When i pick her up for my court order time, within the first 5 minutes i have B, B will say one of a few phrases ""Dad, why do you not want to live with me and mommy, mommy says its because you wanted to live on your own.  Mommy says you are a liar and she wants me to not be like daddy"" or my personal favorite ""Daddy, i dont live with you i just visit you because mommy says i have to""  Here is the honest reason we didnt work out, I texted a co worker some things i should of, I confessed and said I cant continue to be in the relationship.  Ya i did something i should not of but not enough to warrant those phrases from my child. 

Please to all the mothers in the world.  NEVER let you children say these words to the other parent.  And fathers, NEVER let your children believe their mothers are right.

2. When do my rights as a parent become honored by the court and other parent? 

Ok this is a little confusing but to put it frankly, I dont get a say in B's schooling because her mother does not discuss it with me.   Decides to tell me a few days before the start.  I am then pitted between what my child wants and what is right for B.  I dont get say in what functions she is in because her mother will sign her up and say to me ""she does not have to go to these activities when its you time its ok"".  But then when i get B all she talks about is wanting to go to these events.  Am i suppose to tell my child no because she has to be with me? 

Parents weather married, separated or whatever else should never use a scenario to get what they want for their child.  If you think this is okay just read what happens to me weekly and give me one reason its okay that does not come from a place of self interest and we will talk. 

&#x200B;

I know not as brief as i would like but there is so much i am leaving out because what i really need is a healthy discussion.  If you have questions please ask for more information and i will provide.

TL;DR - Why is it that co parenting has become this leveraging act.  Where a parent uses their child to inflict hurt or pain by using their children to get what they want.

When parenting books don't give the promised result,Parenting,36,ddta5a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/ddta5a/when_parenting_books_dont_give_the_promised_result/,51,1570338174.0,"So this is part rant, and part tip for other parents. 

&#x200B;

Many of us parents usually read a parenting book of some kind. Of read blog, websites and forums like this one. There's load of tips on how to raise your kid, weather through tantrums, how to talk to your kid, how to listen, how to get them to cooperate and so on. 

Now be honest, often you read something about a certain approach that should have a certain result, and you try it and...kid still does whatever it always does. Well, you know it takes some time to sink in right? So you keep trying for a few days, a few weeks, but no change. And you kind of start to wonder if that advice actually works. 

Let me give an example of my own life. I have this book 'how to talk to kids so they'll listen'. It contains a lot of little comics of examples how to handle situations with kids. One of these is a kid who wants cheese on his bread, but you're outta cheese. The 'good' comic has the mom empathise 'Yes, you really wanted cheese huh? I too wish I had a great wheel of cheese for you!' And at that point the kid smiles and decides on something else for his sandwich because he felt heard and validated. 

Reality! 

Kid: I want cheese but there's no cheese! 

Me: I understand, and I really wish I had some cheese for you. 

Kid: Get cheese now! 

Me: \*smile\* If I could I would conjure a big wheel of cheese for you! I know you want it.

Kid: I don't care the shop is closed GET CHEESE NOW! \*tantrum ensues\* 

Me: \*silently curses that happy mom and kid from the comic\* 

. 

Example 2! 

The comic version; The kid doesn't want to put on his shoes. The mom offers the choice to put on the red or the blue ones. Or a choice to put them on at the table or on the couch. Kid makes a choice and puts on shoes, because choices empower the kid! 

Reality: I offer the kid choices on which shoes to put on, and where to do it. Kid throws tantrum and throws shoes into the living room, and scream 'I SAID I DIDN'T WANT TO PUT THEM ON!' 

&#x200B;

There have been many moments that I felt lied to by those books. I know I shouldn't expect instant results, and not even quick results, but it's disheartening when after months of trying there seems to be little result. It's often made worse because such books have little real stories from people who followed the training/book/whatever, and had some great quick aha! moment with their kid where things started going better. 

&#x200B;

So fellow parents; this stuff takes months and years to sink in. It just sucks. Generally. the results are worth it though. But in the trenches, it's hard and you often feel like giving up on certain methods. But the methods which focus on empathy (and of course, clear rules, which should be the focus on any parental style) do give results. Just takes about 1-2 years. And yeah, the fact that the empathy is kinda a one way street for most of the time when kids are quite young doesn't help. Just hang in there.","When parenting books don't give the promised resultSo this is part rant, and part tip for other parents.

It's often made worse because such books have little real stories from people who followed the training/book/whatever, and had some great quick aha! moment with their kid where things started going better. 

&#x200B;

So fellow parents; this stuff takes months and years to sink in. It just sucks. Generally. the results are worth it though. But in the trenches, it's hard and you often feel like giving up on certain methods. But the methods which focus on empathy (and of course, clear rules, which should be the focus on any parental style) do give results. Just takes about 1-2 years. And yeah, the fact that the empathy is kinda a one way street for most of the time when kids are quite young doesn't help. Just hang in there."
Reaching a major transition,Parenting,8,ddyp7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/ddyp7i/reaching_a_major_transition/,3,1570365736.0,"My son turned 18 today.

It's hard to believe that the time passed so quickly. Seems as if it just *flew* by. I can't really describe the feeling, but I have a huge smile on my face - because I got him through. Well, he did most of it himself, of course. I know that I was lucky; I've never heard of **any** teen who was easier to raise than he has been. And that's despite the fact that I've been a single parent for the last three years or so. He's a good kid, and we get along great.

I've said it elsewhere, but I'll say it again: the best thing that you can ever do for your children and yourself is *read to them every night*. I hear parents complain that their teens have drifted away from them; that hasn't really happened with me and my son, except to the normal healthy extent that he's developed his own interests. But reading (and talking) every night **works**. And it's a lot of fun.

I'm looking forward to other major milestones in his life, even the ones that will be harder. I think he'll handle them well. He's ready for the world. And I couldn't be more proud of him.","Reaching a major transitionMy son turned 18 today.

My [29M] and ex [30F] have messed up my oldest daughters natural sleep,Parenting,15,ddv5c0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/ddv5c0/my_29m_and_ex_30f_have_messed_up_my_oldest/,28,1570346696.0,"Background: I am a step father to two girls and their mother and I are no longer together. I am the only father figure they have ever had, I have been in the oldest (8yo) life for 6+ years. 

My oldest has ADHD and other behavioral problems due to her biological father only contacting when it‚Äôs convenient for him. Because of her being so hyperactive my ex decided to start giving her melatonin about two years ago. Started with 5mg and it worked very well for a short time. Once her body got use to it my ex decided to go to 10mg and it started working for a short time again. Every time my daughter would get use to the new dosage my ex would bump it up. 

I finally had to step in and say something when 40mg of melatonin wasn‚Äôt doing anything to my 7yo daughter. It caused an argument with it ending in her saying that since she‚Äôs her mother, she will decide what is good and bad for her. I couldn‚Äôt do anything more since I am just the step father. 

Fast forward a few months and my ex takes my oldest to a doctors appointment to see if there is some sort of sleep aid since melatonin no longer has an effect. The doctors prescribed a low dose clonidine and has been taking it for the past year. 

Fast forward to last night...I have my girls for the weekend (typical every other weekend visit) and my ex tells me she forgot to pick up my daughters prescription. After some words I tell her that I‚Äôm sure it won‚Äôt be a big deal and that I‚Äôll figure it out. So come bed time, get my girls ready and put on a movie. My youngest is sleeping within minutes while my oldest is still wide awake. We watch the movie and she asks me to put another one on. I told her I would but she needs to close her eyes and lay down.

I fall asleep and am woken up at about midnight to her watching videos on her iPad. I tell her she needs to put it away and go to bed. She tells me she‚Äôs been trying but just can‚Äôt. I read her a book and rub her back to try and help relax her. We counted sheep, I put on sleepy time noises, nothing was working. Her body finally shut down and she fell asleep at 5am and only slept 4-5 hours. She tried taking a nap but was just restless. You can see the physical and mental fatigue it is having on her. 

She has gotten so use to sleep aids that her body doesn‚Äôt know how to naturally put it self to sleep any more. I fear this will have a developmental negative on her life as she is hitting an age where her brain needs all the sleep it can get. I am hoping this can be reversed.","My [29M] and ex [30F] have messed up my oldest daughters natural sleepBackground: I am a step father to two girls and their mother and I are no longer together.

A bit personal, but, just putting this out there.  I am 22 years old, and I am currently studying a BsC degree in Audio Engineering & Production. My girlfriend of a long time found out she was pregnant four months ago. At first, the fear and the panic and terror triggered my anxious traits real bad, and I went through a period of time where I felt very confused, about everything. But I quickly came around, and starting focussing my thoughts onto my old childhood and (without waxing into it too much) the fact that my dad, although there in person only sometimes, was never there in heart and always held his own interests more closely. I realised this fact had meant that I automatically feel swayed towards doing the opposite, satisfying for my own what I never received from my own dad and always yearned for watching other kids. 

 This is the thought that made me say to myself, dude, you have to commit your efforts 110% towards this baby no matter what your circumstances are. And I instantly clicked, my brain chemistry almost felt malleable, like it was morphing and changing, and it sounds cheesy in a way but it definitely felt like one of those important transition moments. I knew I was going to be a proper Father, not just a dad who is barely present and doesn't put in the time to establish a connection with their child. I keep picturing, even still, all those precious moments I cannot wait to share with my kid, and through the ups and downs I am so excited to try and influence this person and mould them into a decent, caring human who has compassion for others and holds good values. 

I do still have major anxieties, like will my income suffice when raising a child (*FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN MY FINANCIAL SITUATION* ¬£8995 student loan per year PLUS between ¬£6-900 per month, plus I have saved ¬£1500 for when my child is born). Also, even though I am a hard worker, I don't have any problem committing as much time as I can to anything, I also worry whether completing my degree is going to be feasible whilst supporting a child, which mine will be 3 years old by the time I complete my degree. I also worry about gaining employment in my chosen industry whilst being a parent, as I come from a working class background and everyone else I know seems to take a pessimistic perspective every time I seek advice, I always hear ""Oh that's it for you now"" or ""you'll have to work to the bone you'll have no life"" etc. etc. Please bare in mind, I am not a partygoer, I'm past all that, I do not go on lavish nights out drinking, I'd much rather commit that money towards living. Can I still succeed in what I am passionate about and raise a child?

Bottom line, I'm a 22 year old student, and my life has only just BEGUN, it is definitely not over, I am going to be a father to a beautiful child, and I swear I'll make sure this child has a fruitful life, and feels fulfilled and trusting in BOTH of his/her parents.  Thanks to anyone who bothered to read this, and also really sorry for being so personal, I just felt I had to get this out there to some folks.

Under pressure for a 2nd baby,Parenting,28,ddq47s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/ddq47s/under_pressure_for_a_2nd_baby/,53,1570324604.0,"So I‚Äôm in a little pickle with my marriage and could do with some advice from fellow parents here. 

The short story: My wife and I have a wonderful 3 year old boy who is the without a doubt, the best thing I have ever created. My wife desperately wants a second child, I desperately don‚Äôt. 

The long story: My wife is almost 38 and time is ticking for her. I said from the start that I only wanted one child. She was always non committal on numbers. 

I desperately don‚Äôt want a second child. I earn 3/4 of the family income and am already stretched. We both have our own businesses, significant responsibility and I don‚Äôt want the financial commitment, time commitment, stress and responsibility for bringing another human into the world. 

Sadly, my wife‚Äôs mother died shortly after our Son‚Äôs first birthday. The grief took a huge toll on my wife for a significant period of time and I struggled to understand or manage to be able to care for her and understand her emotional needs (a compounding factor here is that I have relatively mild Asperger‚Äôs syndrome). This meant that she now feels she has missed out on being emotionally there to enjoy our son‚Äôs early months and 1st couple of years and feels that she has missed out and wants to do it all again. She describes her want for a second child as a desperate need that comes from deep inside her that she can‚Äôt control. 

Unfortunately, due to us not connecting, we separated for a couple of months about 8 months after her mum died. It was an emotional time for both of us. I drank too much and smoked too much and was a bit of a mess for that period of time. My wife clearly didn‚Äôt want to call it quits and we agreed to get back together. At the time my wife made it clear that if we did then a second child would be part of the package. Foolishly, I agreed and I understand that I‚Äôm a bit of a jerk for doing so when deep down it wasn‚Äôt something I wanted. 

Shortly after, my wife had a miscarriage. I felt like I had dodged a bullet. She felt she had lost everything. 

Then after that, due to my health issues, I had to go onto HRT and in doing so lost my fertility to the extent that we would have to spend tens of thousands for IVF+ICSI to have another child. All in the meantime, I am thinking that I desperately don‚Äôt want. 

So we‚Äôre at a bit of a stalemate. We are having counselling but haven‚Äôt fixed anything yet. It seems as if there are really 3 possible outcomes: 

1. We divorce and I lose being there for my son every night and morning. 
2. We stay together and have another baby for which I take on the extra stress, pressure, financial commitment and end up resentful. 
3. We stay together and don‚Äôt have the child for which she is resentful. 

What on earth is a boy to do?

Then after that, due to my health issues, I had to go onto HRT and in doing so lost my fertility to the extent that we would have to spend tens of thousands for IVF+ICSI to have another child. All in the meantime, I am thinking that I desperately don‚Äôt want. 

So we‚Äôre at a bit of a stalemate. We are having counselling but haven‚Äôt fixed anything yet. It seems as if there are really 3 possible outcomes: 

1. We divorce and I lose being there for my son every night and morning. 
2. We stay together and have another baby for which I take on the extra stress, pressure, financial commitment and end up resentful. 
3. We stay together and don‚Äôt have the child for which she is resentful. 

What on earth is a boy to do? 

Thoughts and advice from parents who have been in a similar situation would be most, most appreciated."
I want another baby but should I?,Parenting,1,ddyv62,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/ddyv62/i_want_another_baby_but_should_i/,3,1570366893.0,"I love my son and he's so adorable even in his mean toddler age. But lately I've been thinking that at some point I want another baby and hopefully a girl but that's complicated.
When I had my first son there where complications and I'm very lucky to be alive right now. The doctors told me how close and bad it got and recommend I never have another kid.
But they dont know why it got complicated or anything... Should I risk it later in life? Idk this seems stupid and I probably won't but I can dream I guess.

Edit: 
Some ask what happened well all was going great till 4 days before predicted due date. His heart stopped for a moment so they induced me but even then it took 2 days before anything changed. Even then I never fully dilated so we had to do a csection. During the csection I hemorrhaged and lost nearly 3 times as much blood is normal. I was litteraly bleeding out and they had to fulling knock me out so they could fix me. When I woke up I was told I had needed 2 blood transfusions and even then they thought i would need a 3rd due to how dead I still looked. 
They dont know why I suddenly just gushed blood that seemed impossible for someone my size to loose and live. And informed me that trying again I might not be so lucky.

But y'all are right, the risk seems to high and I think I'll just have my tubes tied. Not risk my life and my son being alone in the world.

Potty-trained 3yr old who refuses to use the potty for NO REASON AND I AM LOSING MY MIND,Parenting,7,ddw2o2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/ddw2o2/pottytrained_3yr_old_who_refuses_to_use_the_potty/,9,1570351030.0,"Hi smart people of reddit, I'm new to this sub but I'm hoping someone has some great advice for me.

My son will be three in a few weeks. He has been potty-trained for about 4 months. At first the potty-training went well, and he was telling us when he needed to go pee pretty reliably. But he gradually stopped doing that, and it has turned into a battle of wills. As I write this, he just peed in his pants after refusing to go for 6 hours -- and my husband, who normally NEVER loses his cool, was FURIOUS at him. We are both at our wits' end.

I feel like we've tried everything for a few days each -- positive reinforcement for going (stickers, etc), we've tried reminding him frequently (he always insists he doesn't have to go), we've tried having a routine (for example, we always pee when we get up! We always pee before we leave the house!) etc. We've tried putting him in big-kid underwear and letting him be in charge of it. Nothing seems to make any difference.  We've tried patiently reminding him that it's the next thing, and we won't proceed with fun activity X until he goes pee. He never admits he has to go, and he never goes of his own accord. At times he has sat quietly in his room for half an hour or more while we all wait for him to go so we can leave the house.

He goes pretty reliably at daycare, but they have to really talk him into it there too -- they've complained to us about it before. He doesn't have accidents there and wears underwear during the day (Just switched from pull-ups to underwear on their recommendation) At home he usually wears underwear during the day as well, and cloth (washable) pull-ups at night. We made a big deal of the special Paw Patrol underwear and how he needed to keep them dry, and at first it seemed to make a real impact on him but now he doesn't care.

He's not afraid of the potty. He uses sometimes a little potty in the bathroom and sometimes a potty seat on the big toilet. He also sometimes pees standing up. None of these are enticements, it's the same response to everything.

Also, when we were out about about he used to use public bathrooms relatively peacefully but now it's the same thing wherever we go -- he never admits he needs to go.

I'm worried that at this point it's a power struggle and he's doing it just to be difficult -- he's being really obstinate about lots of things lately (tantrums about everything). Plus all of us have been sick for WEEKS which doesn't help; our sleep is all messed up, he's being picky about food etc. etc. None of it good. But this is extra-frustrating because he used to do it and he stopped for no reason. Also the refusing the pee is all the time , and has been gradually getting worse for a couple months -- even when he's in an otherwise good mood, and before he was sick, it was the same problem.

I would be super appreciative of any advice or even just comforting ""our kid was like that too and now he pees in the toilet like a normal person"" type stories. Thanks!

Does it help?My daughter (6) has been diagnosed with ADHD, but as it is not affecting her schoolwork, we are just laying low and seeing how things unfold.  My son (4) is not diagnosed yet, but I am already seeing the same red flags in his behavior.  He is also having a very hard time controlling his anger, and gets in trouble a lot at school.

We have really rough weekends with lots of temper tantrums and general crankiness, even though we tend to keep our days pretty laid back.  We do not mess with their sleep schedules at all...in general, they are asleep by 8 and awake by 7 no matter what day it is.

I have been wondering if keeping a ‚Äúschool-like‚Äù schedule on the weekends would help bring more structure to those days and would ultimately help our kids to feel more calm.  Does anyone do this?  What does such a schedule look like?

I was reading through some posts and was reminded of how hard it was for me when my kids were babies. Colic. Over-tired crying. Tantrums. I can't remember if I read this somewhere or if I just made it up, but it was as if my kids' crying was pitched at a frequency that went through me like electricity through water.

Pretty early on, I started wearing earplugs, and it was a complete game changer. I could hold a baby who was crying at full volume *for as long as they needed!* With earplugs I was able to keep them right there with me, face-to-face, without getting that frazzled, fried feeling that, at least for me, always made me feel like I was at the end of my rope.   


I guess the most important thing about wearing earplugs was they allowed me to empathize more, even when I was dead tired. I think they just allowed me to be a better parent.

My fiancee blames it on him watching YouTube but I try to limit his tv viewing to only in the morning when I'm getting ready and in the evening when we get home and I need to get stuff out the car. And he only watches cocomelon because I don't really know nursery rhymes to sing to him. 

I know that television at his age isn't recommended but it's hard to calmly get dressed or do anything when he is screaming. And he will scream for an hour straight if u let him because I did tried the ""no tv"" method before and I found the screaming unbearable. 

Sometimes when the videos play he is sitting quietly in his playpen playing with his toys and other times he s dancing to the songs. 

Him viewing videos isn't a new trend. He has been doing this since he was 6 months but now that he is turning 1 and he hasn't hit his speech milestone in starting to wonder if this is just his developmental speed or is it something I am doing. He is hitting his gross and fine motor developmental milestones but this is delayed. Should I be worried?","Am I the reason my son isn't talkingHey all

I‚Äôm a younger mom and I feel like I can‚Äôt relate to anyone...,Parenting,6,ddn7b2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/ddn7b2/im_a_younger_mom_and_i_feel_like_i_cant_relate_to/,21,1570310621.0,"I‚Äôm not a super young mom, just younger than average.

It‚Äôs hard to relate to both other moms and also my friends. I love my Mom Facebook group, but the majority of them are older, and most are planning/trying for a second or third kid, and I have no interest in that yet. And they all seem so content just staying in most nights with their kids.

Would you call the police on other children?,Parenting,1,ddurat,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/ddurat/would_you_call_the_police_on_other_children/,25,1570344954.0,"Throwaway

A few minutes ago, my 11-year-old came back from seeing if a friend could play to tell me that the boy's brothers (8ish and 12ish) threatened to get a gun and shoot her if she didn't leave. I'm torn on calling the police because:

1) these kids are already constantly in contact with the police. The boy my daughter went to see is the only one of like, 7 kids that hasn't been in trouble with the law. The parents have had their kids removed a couple different times but they keep getting them back and let them run around town, stealing bikes and toys (and even the parent's own cars), and nothing has really been done about it.

2) This isn't the first time they've threatened other kids, and it won't be the last.

3) They live 2 blocks away and we see them all the time. I don't want to have to deal with any retribution because they'll be mad that I called the police.

Buuuuuuuut, they DID threaten my daughter. I don't know if they even own a gun or if they were just being little jerks, but I'm very upset about it and my daughter is pretty scared. I don't know what to do.","Would you call the police on other children?Throwaway

I(34,M) and my wife(35,F) had been trying to have a kid since 2013.
Some background of us, I have been working for a company as a salesman for the last 10 years. It's a very small company but as I live in a third world country, work is really hard to find. I do not have the opportunity to grow as the supply for jobs is much higher than the demand. My wife is a house maker and we have been married 8 years. As I said its a third world country so health care or health insurance isn't something we are provided by the company I work for. 

We were first blessed with a kid in the year 2015 but due to some complications my wife had a miscarriage. We cried every day but we couldn't do much about it. 

We were blessed with an another baby daughter in the year 2017 and she is an angel. We have had so many happy moments. My baby is the most precious thing that I have in life. She had always been a skinny kid and we didn't think much of it. We thought its just her physical appearance. She had been constantly falling sick but that is where we were wrong. We thought that kids fall sick all the time. 

A week ago we discovered that our daughter has leukemia. 
22 days ago my baby all of a sudden started swelling. Her stomach was all bloated and we didn't understand what to do about it so we took her to a doctor. Her lymph nodes were all swollen up. 

We couldn't understand what was going on, I did know that lymph nodes are swollen if someone has cancer but no parent on earth would even wish to imagine something so horrible for their kid. She was breathing heavy. My poor baby. 

We went to the doctor. The doctor adviced us for have a few tests. I was there with my kid. It was so horrible to watch. My baby. My poor baby. I wish that she would get all my life. I would trade her life for mine without thinking much. But that is not how it works. 

Yesterday I went to the governments office to seek help but they told me it takes time. My baby doesn't have that.

We talked to the doctors and they advised us that we need to go through a lot of procedures that will make our daughter live. The problem here that we have is it's extremely expensive. The savings we have isn't enough for our daughter and I feel like I have failed as a father.

My wife is blaming me if we loose our daughter, it's on me. As I have been the provider for our house. She literally told me that If I was incapable wealth wise I shouldn't have had a kid. I understand she is panicking. I am ashamed but what do I do?

Advice for nurturing my Daughter's musical talent?,Parenting,5,ddmpob,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/ddmpob/advice_for_nurturing_my_daughters_musical_talent/,9,1570307842.0,"Hi there, this is my first post. Normally I feel I have everything 'figured out', but i'm a bit stumped on this one. 

My daughter (8) has recently started taking Piano lessons. She is Autistic, normally quite shy, introverted and feels anxious easily. The teacher has spoken to my Wife about how she's doing and he basically said ""she's gifted"". She's learning a lot faster than most kids do per lesson, and he's having a bit of trouble keeping up with how fast she's learning the materials. We have a keyboard at home which she's been practicing on, but neither me or my wife are particularly knowledgeable or talented when it comes to music. 

The fact she's autistic is something we need to consider. She loves music, but she gets stressed and anxious easily. I'm asking on advice from other parents, perhaps those who also have anxious or autistic kids, how the best way to approach nurturing her talent without stressing her out? We don't want her to give up on something potentially great because she finds it too stressful, but we don't want to 'push' or helicopter parent her either.","Advice for nurturing my Daughter's musical talent?Hi there, this is my first post.

My wife and I aren't tiger parents but our daughter behaves like we are. How can we get her to not put so much pressure on herself academically?,Parenting,112,dddap9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dddap9/my_wife_and_i_arent_tiger_parents_but_our/,54,1570250901.0,"My kids are in high school and attend a highly competitive public school where everyone is focused on getting the best grades possible. It is a blessing and a curse. I love it because I think having a peer group that cares about academics can be a good thing when kids are starting to care more about what their friends think than what their parents think. We tend to be the house that all of the kids friends gather at and both have high achieving friends. My son's friends are mostly athletes but even they put school first. My son seems to have a much better balance than my daughter, though. He is a hard working straight A student who loves school, but he is also involved in sports, student government, and school clubs. He still has free time and likes to just hang out with friends at the park on the weekends or have a group over to chill. 

My sophomore daughter seems to be hyper focused on academics. The school limits kids to one AP sophomore year and my daughter has yet to stop complaining about it. She thinks she could have handled two and is worried about being behind kids at other schools. She is getting ready to take her first PSAT and has been doing SAT prep because she hopes to use this test to prepare for the PSAT next year since juniors with high enough scores can qualify for a national merit scholarship. She she is essentially preparing for a practice test to a practice test. She is someone who likes preparing and being in control. After taking a summer enrichment course, I noticed she seemed a bit down. She said she loved the course but was now annoyed because it may have changed her ideas on what she wants to major in. This was prior to sophomore year of high school. 

I know it may not seem like a huge deal but I am worried about her putting too much pressure on herself and burning out. My wife and I say that she might be the least emotional teen on the planet but she pushes so much down and that concerns me. She isn't the type to really say how she's feeling. She is super serious and moves along until she eventually kind of shuts down. You hear stories about overworked teens that develop severe anxiety and I want to make sure we avoid that. We have suggested mental health days from school but she refuses. She hates missing school for any reason. I even schedule her dentist appointments (she wears braces) for after school because she hates it that much. She does relax sometimes and has other things she enjoys. She plays an instrument for her school orchestra and does robotics and quiz bowl. She has friends over sometimes and spends time online, but almost all of her online time is spent researching something and over last weekend it was a struggle to pull her off the computer for dinner because she fell into a hole while doing honors chem homework. We are thrilled when she walks around with friends playing Pokemon-Go. 

My wife and I both feel like we need to do something but aren't sure what to do. We both value education but have never put that pressure on our kids. We do not punish or reward for grades. Pulling her out of that school isn't really an option and I don't think it would solve our issues. She genuinely loves school and looks forward to it. Our concerns are more about the next two years when school become more stressful. While the school is competitive, they are aware of that and make an effort to decrease stress levels like limiting APs. I do think the school plays a role in this but her personality (stubborn, driven, tendency to become hyper focused) and certain aspects of her life are probably more to blame. I apologize for the length of this post. There is a lot of information on how to motivate kids to do care more about school but I can't find much about doing the opposite.

Edit: Wanted to add that my wife and I have talked to our daughter about our concerns. She brushes it off and says she is fine. She knows that both of us attended public state universities for college and that didn't stop us from going to the graduate/med schools of our choice. I want to be clear that we are not trying to make her into something she is not. Being a nerdy introvert is more than fine (my wife and I both are) but being a stressed out grade student driven by letters on a report card can be an issue.

She had one of these mild little colds start up a few weeks ago, and for two weeks I kept her home from her usual activities outside of daycare (library craft and dancing), because I obviously didn't want her getting too close to any of the other kids.

Teenage daughter 101 aka what am I doing wrong?,Parenting,7,ddievf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/ddievf/teenage_daughter_101_aka_what_am_i_doing_wrong/,7,1570277693.0,"Ok. So I am new to reddit. I've never posted before but I've read plenty of other posts. I have a 13 year old daughter. She is very self-aware and has a good head on her shoulders. I am very surprised at this. I always thought I had screwed up her life after her father and I divorced. However, she has proven to be a well adjusted young woman. 
Since she was 8 we have had a code-word system to discuss some high level issues. Ie. Sex, boys, girls, emotions, period, etc. In the past 2 years we have had ""in the vault"" convos. Talks that remain just between us, unless it's very serious. Then I can discuss them with her father. He is very understanding, but will always see her as his baby girl. 
Recently some of our talks have been leading to her sexual orientation.  She looks at herself as being bi. Which is not an issue for me. I am bi as well. She has not talked to her father yet but said she will when the time is right. Then she kinda dropped a bomb on me today...""mom, I have been masturbating."" 
I kinda laughed and said that its perfectly normal to masturbate.  She started sharing details about what she has used. Nothing was appropriate.  So I told her we are going to make a stop at Walgreens on our way home. 
I walked to the aisle with tampons and condoms.  Yes. I bought my daughter her first vibrator.  I actually felt very proud of myself and I even got extra batteries. Lol. I gave her the box and told her about proper etiquette (put a sock on the door and to clean up after). We talked a little more about how men and women orgasm differently. Plus I jokingly showed her the ""Friends"" clip of the seven erogenous zones. She laughed. We hugged and went our separate ways. 
Later, I went to check on her.  I found her asleep in her room. I noticed the box was opened and left on her desk. I said goodnight and I love you. Then I simply smiled and closed her door behind me. 
There are crazy days and more crazy days with a teenage daughter. One thing is constant, you will never know the perfect way to handle anything, and nothing is ever perfect. 
But this night was pretty close.","Teenage daughter 101 aka what am I doing wrong?Ok. So I am new to reddit. I've never posted before but I've read plenty of other posts.

She was out of the house on a shopping trip, and I was looking for a charge cord in her room when I saw one of her current sketchbooks on her desk. Normally I don't snoop but my curiousity was killing me. I opened the book and to my surprise I found some pretty hardcore porn sprinkled in. It was basically lots of bondage and gay men.

Honestly, I was so taken aback by this and still can't imagine my daughter drawing stuff so... sexual. She seems so innocent on the outside. she dresses conservatively and doesn't even date. I thought I didn't have to worry about her.

Should I do something about this? I feel like I should confront her, and ask her why she thinks it's okay to draw stuff like that.

Email:

Today (my daughter) and I had a discussion on body parts and what is private. She got uncomfortable and didn't want to talk to me because I used 'bad words'

Let me be very clear:¬†


Vagina is NOT A BAD WORD.¬†


It is very important that (my daughter) feel like she can talk to me about anything. And because one or both of you decided to tell her that was a bad word she didn't want to talk to me.¬†


She will know the correct terms for her body and she will not be shamed for using them. If you can not handle that then we will have to have a different discussion. I will not tolerate either one of you undermining my parenting anymore. I love you both and I do not want to keep (my daughter) from you by any means; however, this has to stop. If you have a question about how (my husband) and I are raising OUR daughter then you can speak to us about it, do not just say and do whatever comes to mind.

 It IS okay for her to paint her nails. It IS okay for her to have blue hair or pink hair or blond hair. It IS okay if she grows up and one day tells me she is a lesbian. I will love her and treat her with respect no matter what she decides to do with her life.¬†


¬†You are no one's judge.¬†


We are raising her to have a relationship with God, to be strong and independent and to one day be able to survive in this world without us because we won't always be here to coddle her. You may not like it but that's just tough, you've raised your kids.¬†


¬†I'm not doing this blindly. I pray. I research. I reach out to professionals as well as seek advice from experienced parents such as yourselves.¬†


You may not like that I have a different vocabulary, blue hair, tattoos, piercings, and animals but none of those make me a bad person or a terrible mother.¬† I am a Christian, and I do not believe that God will deny me entry to heaven because I decorate my body. This is just a vessel. The importance is heart and soul and how we treat other living beings. THAT is what I am teaching (my daughter).


Since you are both so fond of Mayo Clinic, I've attached a link to an article from their website describing the importance of teaching your children about their bodies and also how to talk to them about sex. Both are topics that (my husband) and I are responsible for teaching (my daughter). Not you.¬†

Preschool nap time/anxiety issues?,Parenting,2,ddj8bk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/ddj8bk/preschool_nap_timeanxiety_issues/,11,1570283274.0,"My 4 year old goes to a private daycare/preschool. They have one to two hours of nap time a day. My son does not need a nap. If he takes one, he will not fall asleep at night until 9:30-10. If he doesn't take one he falls asleep pretty well around 8:30 which is an acceptable time, but he gets in trouble at daycare because he can't lay quietly for two hours. He is a super social kid and he has a lot of anxiety about keeping to himself for too long. I realize that this is something that's not perfect and we work on it, but he can't be expected to be ""fixed"" over night. 

Today when I picked him up he was upset. He didn't behave adequately at nap time so he wasn't allowed to have cake or participate in a classmate's birthday. I understand that bad behavior should have consequences, but the feeling of being left out of someone's birthday party really compounded things for him. When we got home he barfed on the floor. I can't be sure it was because of him being so upset but he didn't seem otherwise ill. I felt pretty bad for the guy. 

The most annoying part to me is that his teachers always say his day was fine and never bring up behavior issues to us. We hear about his punishments from him and he has a hard time articulating what behavior brought them on. When asked teachers seem to brush it off as not a big deal. He's not a perfect kid but he always means well and most of his getting in trouble stems from his strong desire to interact and be with people. 

I just feel like I have exhausted my advice to my son for getting over this nap time behavior and I don't know what to ask of daycare to make it so he's not constantly getting into trouble over nap time.

"Son (almost 4) will dance around holding his penis yet tell me he doesn't to pee ü§îü§® Refuses to use toilet until the very last minute. If any y'all have dealt with this, please tell me your secrets.",Parenting,2,ddixcc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/ddixcc/son_almost_4_will_dance_around_holding_his_penis/,8,1570281103.0,"My son, let's call him Dr No Tinkle, only started toilet training 4-5 months ago so it's still fairly new. I believe the reasons Dr No Tinkle doesn't want to go is because he doesn't like to wash his hands, would prefer not to stop doing whatever is engaging him and also wants to be in control of when he goes.

It's not really a big problem for me because he rarely wets himself however Dr No Tinkle will become very fidgety and agitated to the point where he won't be able to sit still. It's not nice for Dr No Tinkle and can be irritating if he is having dinner or just behaving badly because he's feeling uncomfortable.

So I've tried:

1. We do ""special"" wees where mummy does all the work so Dr No Tinkle doesn't need to wash his hands. I know, I know it's not a great solution but I figured if it made him more willing to pee then I would slowly encourage hand washing again with fun soaps etc. This strategy helps sometimes

2. I've tried to not say anything so that he feels more in control. Or if I do say something it will be more of an observation like ""you're grabbing yourself and can't sit still, maybe you need to pee. You'll feel better if you do"".

3. I've tried explaining why he has that feeling to pee-""your wee is in a big sack called a bladder and when it's full your body tells you it's time to empty it by weeing""

The only way I can get him to pee sometimes is to tell him he is going to get a timeout if he doesn't. I know not great but if we are leaving the house then he needs to bloody wee! 

If anyone has any thoughts, advice then Dr No Tinkle and myself would be very grateful :)","Son (almost 4) will dance around holding his penis yet tell me he doesn't to pee ü§îü§® Refuses to use toilet until the very last minute.

Tween: Not wanting to do anything family related,Parenting,8,ddbtgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/ddbtgr/tween_not_wanting_to_do_anything_family_related/,17,1570244613.0,"Is this a standard for tweens, to not want to do anything with the family.

This weekend her uncle and aunt, whom she loves, wants to go do a fall family excursion. She seems miffed by this.

Afterwards, I coordinated a sleepover for her and her bestie.

The next day, I planned to take her to a family function on her dad's side. They asked personally for us to attend a Dave and Buster's type of event.

She sighed again and asked, ""Do I have to go?!""

It seems all she wants to do is stay home.

If this is part of the stage, fine, but how do I handle these groans and whines and hold my schmidt? I'd love to say, ""listen kid, I'd love to kick back and sleep in but we rarely see our family and what a blessing that they ask us personally to spend time with us. There will be plenty of days for us to sleep in and not talk to each other and stare at Tik Tok.""

I just want to know if this is normal for a kid to whine and groan at anything that doesn't involve sitting on a couch and staring into their phone. Thanks.

&#x200B;

Follow up:

So she came with us. At first she sulked but then after I fed her and she got some alone time with her Aunt, she was in a better mood. I think at this stage it's just the idea of doing something out of the normal routine puts a tween off especially when it's not their plans. Once she settles, she's fine and has fun. It's just getting through that sulking phase.

I did speak to her and told her that she has the power to make a situation better or worse for not only her but those around her. I asked her to think how a person's outlook on something can bring a group up or down in her set of friends and how that can be the same in family events.

I want to take more responsibility with his milestones - not developmentally, but things like moving out of a highchair to the table, using utensils, etc. I'm an only child and didn't grow up seeing other children get raised so I really have no basis of knowing what should come next. Can you guys help me know what should be coming up?

Right now he's 20 months old. He is still in a highchair, uses utensils pretty well, drinks from a no-spill cup, and stands on a stool to ""brush"" his own teeth (with help obviously). 

Currently, we're considering changing his crib into a toddler bed in about a month. I  think that's pretty early because he'd be way too distracted to sleep. This would mainly be to help potty train him around 2, but it seems like a lot of people let their kiddos still wear a diaper at night and it doesn't inhibit their potty behavior in the daytime.

Regardless, that's the kind of thing I'm wanting to know about. After toddler bed and potty training (maybe even around the same time), what else do we need to work on as far as life/human skills are concerned? 

To add to the complications a little bit, my son was born deaf and has cochlear implants. He is doing very well with his speech, but it does cause a few unique problems. And I consider myself to be on the spectrum, exhibiting most of the classic signs of Asperger's.

Wife makes physical threats to child,Parenting,11,dda8r5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dda8r5/wife_makes_physical_threats_to_child/,33,1570237729.0,"My wife and I have a 5 year old together.

We were both emotionally and physically abused by our parents. The difference between me and her is I went to therapy, and I learned that the way I was raised was abusive, but she still views her upbringing as disciplinary rather than abusive and she's happy that she experienced it . She always defends how her parents treated her. It's a bunch of nonsense IMO and I wish I could have gone back in time and reevaluated how big of a red flag that was. 

Prior to having a kid, we discussed discipline. We agreed that we both don't agree with using physical violent, but she does believe in spanking ""every now and then."" We were divided over the issue of using physical and emotional threats such as ""imma beat your ass if you don't behave yourself."" I disagreed with such usage, and she said she's OK with it. But I told her that I needed a partner who won't use such tactics. She told me that she's open to thinking differently and will do some soul searching on the subject and eventually agreed that she'll follow my lead on this. She said she'd defer to me.

When she initially told me this, I was not totally convinced that she was sincere. I also didn't like the idea that it seems she's only agreeing because she knows I'll leave if she doesn't, which means she doesn't genuinely believe this.

Anyways, fast forward 5 years, and she's now using these tactics. I don't want to label her as an ""abusive"" mother because I don't think she is, but she started using physical threats against the child. She says things like ""You're going to get a spanking if you don't clean up right away."" Aside from threats, she's very loving and calm with the child.

I confronted her about it and repeated her words from years ago that she agreed she wasn't going to use those tactics. I also told her that if our kid repeated this outside, we'd be getting a child protective service (CPS) call, and her response was extremely unsettling to me. She said ""we'll raise our kid to have common sense."" What she implied was that the kid is going to have common sense so that he does not dare say this outside to others. I told her ""Listen to yourself. You essentially just admitted that what you're doing is wrong, otherwise you'd have no fear of him disclosing this info to others. And also, I am shocked that you are labeling something like that as common sense. The fact that you think this is very distressing for me.""

I offered that we go to therapy, and she said she's willing, but this views seem to be very deeply rooted within her, and I'm a firm believer that people rarely change. Idk what else to do, but I'm considering telling her that I'd report her to CPS if I hear that again (CPS honestly probably won't do shit).

I could file for divorce, and we can fight over custody in court, but I am certain the courts aren't going to care about her using those kind of threats on kids. I've seen much worse allegations in the court system that were side eyed by judges.

&#x200B;

I don't know what to do. I mean she's so empathetic and patient and loving (she's not violent, manipulative, aggressive, or passive aggressive), and making threats like this, empty or not, just seems to go against her character. She's also a believer in making empty threats, which I don't think is conducive.

&#x200B;

I also feel like she kind of betrayed my trust by making me believe that she changed her views when she clearly has not.

My son's bio dad (30M) has been in and out of jail of the past 5 years. He has had many opportunities to visit, but he has only met ""our"" son three times in the past 3 years. 

He and I only dated for only 5 months and he was really bad for me. Got me into a lot of drugs. My head was totally out of it.  NO EXCUSE to not use bc, but i would take plan b if he told me there was a chance of...you know. We broke up about a week before I found out I was pregnant. Typical story, he was there for 3 months. Promsed he be the dad he never had. Then completely vanished, moving in with the girl (barely 18) 250 miles away, to the town where he sold drugs (""never shit where you eat""). 

God this is hard to write. Last winter he and his gf started harassing me. After no contact for 6 months, He texted one night till 1AM horrible things. They both were. I was in tears devestated. Personal attacks on my parenting & appearance. It was 100% clear he was on drugs again.  I told him to stop contacting me, that any further communication is harassment. He stopped, gf wouldnt. Calls from blocked #s all night, all day. Police told me they couldn't do anything to prove it was her making the calls. And to change my #. Eventually after calling the police 6 times, i changed it. She has 3 different Instagram accounts I know of. Had to block, but she kept harassing me. Made everything private, but im sure she is stalking the social media of my family. At this point I spoke to Bio we agreed to be civil and only talk about ""our"" son.

She started texting ftom his phone. I didnt report this because he is on probation (parole? I forget which one) and i was NOT going ro be the reason he went to jail (15+ year sentence).

 I didnt want to inteoduce him to my son if he 1) doesnt want to, and 2) is on drugs. 

Since he only came to my house when his mom dragged, i said if he wanted to see my son the would have to set it up, not his mom. This resulted in no one contacting me until he goes to jail agan this spring.

His mom contacted me 6 months ago and we started getting together. I absolutely LOVE his family. They have been so warm and accepting. Similar to my family, they are close. Bio's mom and step dad are amaxing people. It was awkward at first, he lies so much God only knows what he told her. She was wary of me, as well she should! Its one of the reasons I think she makes a awesome grandma. She loves unconditionally and never gives up on the people.

Anyway, son loves them, they love him. His extended family are coming to town, and I am honored and thrilled they want to include my son. Issue- my son will see bio for the first time in a year. He doesnt remeber meeting him, this will basically be the first time.

Bio is going to rehab, then plans to move BACK with his gf, to the SAME place he has been arrested 5 times for serrious drug offenses. 

I wish he wasnt there, but my son shouldn't miss out, its his family too.

Bio's gf is still crazy, now that he is out she is contacting me again by making more social accounts, and found my email. I block and document each time.

Side note- he refuses to admit Theyre together. He calls her a crazy bitch. Im sure he says the same thing about me.

I dont want her around my son ever. Im afriad if we do family stuff with them she'll be there. Per court agreement, im going above and beyond for my son's sake, but him meeting her is a huge line I refuse to cross. Im worried that more leniency on my part is paving the way to family events with the gf.

Is it that hard not to get lice???,Parenting,0,ddh66e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/ddh66e/is_it_that_hard_not_to_get_lice/,28,1570270180.0,"Ok fellow reddit parents, my husband often says to ask reddit when we're in disagreement and this time I'm actually doing it. 

His 11 year old daughter,  my stepdaughter, has come to our house with lice in her hair way too many times. 

After one of the times a few months ago, I told my husband he had to check her head before coming in the house each time she comes here from her mom's or school. Already tired of having to wash sheets and everything a billion times and vacuuming like a madwoman constantly trying to prevent it from spreading, I told my husband it had to stop!

Of course, he didn't follow through, and now everyone and everything in our home is infested, again.

At this point, she is a fully functioning, healthy, smart, 11 year old, and I am of the mindset that she should be more than capable of not contracting lice. 

I've told her that she needs to be super careful about sharing hats, scarves, hair stuff etc with her friends yet I've witnessed her sharing headbands with friends and even trying on hats and stuff in stores (I flipped out on her in Goodwill). 

Each time I remind her why and what not to do but alas, here we are yet again......

I think at her age she is old enough to be responsible enough to not get lice! But she says I'm making her feel bad when I tell her she could prevent this, and my husband doesn't hold her responsible at all.

The question for you guys is, is 11 years old old enough to be able to remember to keep stuff away from your hair that could infect you with lice?","Is it that hard not to get lice???Ok fellow reddit parents, my husband often says to ask reddit when we're in disagreement and this time I'm actually doing it. 

His 11 year old daughter,  my stepdaughter, has come to our house with lice in her hair way too many times. 

After one of the times a few months ago, I told my husband he had to check her head before coming in the house each time she comes here from her mom's or school. Already tired of having to wash sheets and everything a billion times and vacuuming like a madwoman constantly trying to prevent it from spreading, I told my husband it had to stop!

Of course, he didn't follow through, and now everyone and everything in our home is infested, again.

At this point, she is a fully functioning, healthy, smart, 11 year old, and I am of the mindset that she should be more than capable of not contracting lice. 

I've told her that she needs to be super careful about sharing hats, scarves, hair stuff etc with her friends yet I've witnessed her sharing headbands with friends and even trying on hats and stuff in stores (I flipped out on her in Goodwill). 

Each time I remind her why and what not to do but alas, here we are yet again......

I am just super uncomfortable with not knowing when I can relax and when I have to perform/am on call so to speak. We had no set rules or labor division (let's be real, young children are hard work) when it came to our son so we would just sit and be exhausted the both of us all day.

Then we came up with a plan. Mom wakes up with him, gets him ready for daycare and wakes me up when that's done, my part is the walk to the daycare and dropping him off.

We split the parenting so from 15-18 I am ""on"". That means if a diaper needs changing it's by default my job to change it, we go outside and play and all of this, then I make food and after dinner mom is ""on"". That means I get to kick it (although we are in the same room). If my son requires my attention or wants to play with me specifically I don't just hush him away, neither does mom in her off time but any chores related to parenting fall on the ""on"" parent. The ""on"" time can be changed depending on plans but the aim is to split it 50-50.

We then get him ready for bed together around 20:30 and usually have a little date night at the end of the day with a movie or something the like.

My life has completely changed and I went from being completely put off by the idea of a 2nd, to actually wanting one and his brother will be welcomed to this world in March. We both have much more energy to actually spend quality time with our son too.

"""you don't love me"" and other negative statements/behavior",Parenting,4,dd8bkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dd8bkl/you_dont_love_me_and_other_negative/,10,1570229125.0,"My partner and I have two little boys - 5 and 3.  This post is about the 5 year old.  The 5 year old started kindergarten this year and is doing well.  He just got a raving review from his teacher and progress report.  So academically and behaviorally in school he is fine.  

But lately we have been having some really negative behavior in the evenings. He's been very negative - everything is terrible, we don't love him, etc.  The ""you don't love me"" thing is honestly infuriating, because of course we love him.  It hurts us, and we tell him it does.  We don't then turn around and reward it (we don't try to indulge him to prove we love him, that is).  

 WE are a two working parent household, so our time together in the evening is short - although we always eat dinner together.  I'd say we are strict but loving - we make him practice his sight words and homework every night, but we try our best to reward often.  We are very big on positive reinforcement.  

 Also, he's always struggled with good behavior when he is tired or not feeling well. He's actually pretty terrible about telling us when he is sick.  So, bad behavior usually coincides with him being sick or tired or both. And right now he's probably tired and a little sick (i had a cold last week and it is going around).  Days are long - he rides the bus to and from school, so it is a long day for him as well as all of us.  But as I wrote above, I think he gets enough sleep.

We also think part of this is manipulation ..... - he wants to test us and see what he can get out of us.  

But also, the sheer negativity has me worried.  And it isn't just occasional.  The past couple of weeks it is daily.  Every day it is the same stuff - dinner is yucky and not good (even though he is scarfing it down) - we aren't nice to him - we don't love him - yada yada yada.  

How can we get him to be more positive?  And quite frankly, it is very hurtful for us to hear these things.  We express that to him and he continues to say it.  How can we encourage him to not resort to this kind of talk?

He has a good chance of qualifying for a scholarship that is full tuition and books, and a stipend towards housing.

I believe her behavior is pretty standard for a four year old but she's very strong willed, very independent, and highly energetic. I don't want to quash these characteristics but we're struggling to find ways to channel them into positive activities. 

Many nights after when we all get home from work/daycare it feels like a chain of one thing to the next. ""Don't stand on the couch, stop pulling on your baby sister, don't put the cat in a headlock, stop throwing things, don't touch that..."" etc. 

Our biggest issue is that many of these things are things we've explained to her not to do and why she shouldn't do them. Any further correction mostly seems to get shrugged off and she doesn't actually seem to ever try to stop herself before going onto the next thing that she shouldn't do. We've recently been getting reports from her daycare provider that listening to direction and following rules is becoming an issue there, too. 

How can we effectively communicate with her these expectations in a way that will incite change in her behavior? We've tried timeouts ‚Äî¬†which I'm not a huge fan of ‚Äî and are trying to revoke privileges when appropriate but I feel like theres a communication breakdown that I don't know how to address.

We've tried timeouts ‚Äî¬†which I'm not a huge fan of ‚Äî and are trying to revoke privileges when appropriate but I feel like theres a communication breakdown that I don't know how to address. I suspect that because she's very active and gets into everything any correction from adults has just become noise that lands on deaf ears. How can we break out of this? Thank you!"

So my almost 10 month old DD used to sleep through the night most nights the odd occasion she would stir it would be a quick 5 min put the dummy back in her mouth pat her tummy and shes out again.

Now about a month or so ago she got croup really bad which resulted in her sleeping on me for about a week in the lounge because I could not get her down anywhere to sleep she would lose the plot so we stuck it out until she got better and we now have to sleep train her again
 

I have tried every method I could find CIO doesnt work she only gets more upset and so do I.(did it all night one night and she ended up bawling everytime we got near her room) 

At the moment what seems to be working is putting her into bed drowsy and sitting next to her while she sleeps but the past week she has been fighting it something fierce I can get her to sleep she will sleep 20mins and be back up again for hours! Or on the odd occasion she stays in bed she just wakes up multiple times I would lo e some advice or ideas on what I should do!!

My wife wants another child after saying she didn't want another for years. (Long read),Parenting,3,dd27ik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dd27ik/my_wife_wants_another_child_after_saying_she/,30,1570190611.0,"My wife and I are 28 years old. We had our daughter when we were 21 and she is turning 7 years old in a few weeks. She was an ""accident"". My wife was excited. I was terrified right up until she was born. But we became parents and we love our little girl more than anything. Years passed. I wanted a second kid. My wife did not. I resigned myself to our daughter being an only child, but now my wife has changed her mind and wants a second kid. I feel like it's too late. I feel like I've convinced myself that one child is best and I can't imagine changing my mind now.

Pregnancy was hard on my wife. Prior to pregnancy she was taking anti-depressants and on the recovering end of an eating disorder but was still underweight. Pregnancy made her gain a lot of weight, which she hated. Her hormones were awful due to her doctors telling her she shouldn't take her anti-depressants anymore. She had to be put on bed-rest for four months and this hurt us financially. We also were not getting along very well during this time. I was constantly concerned about money, rent, how much freedom I was losing at such a young age. My wife's moods were all over the place and we argued a lot which made pregnancy harder.

But we got through it and came out stronger as a couple and as parents and are happy for it. When my daughter turned four years old I brought up having another baby. I wanted my daughter to have a playmate as a kid. Someone she could play legos with, go to the park with, play outside with. I wanted her to have someone who would help take care of us when we got old and more importantly take care of her when we died. My wife's answer was a very hard resounding ""No."" Her reasoning was that she'd be happy to adopt a child or have another kid if I could be the one who got pregnant. She didn't like what pregnancy did to her body or our relationship at the time. She did get her figure back but it was hard work and she had to be careful not to overdo it due to her previous eating disorder. She also has stretch marks and frequently complains about her 'pouch' even though she is fit and skinny, the skin just wont ever return to it's same tightness, and that bothers her. 

My wife is of course, an independent woman. I brought it up a few more times over the next month and years because I felt like our window for having two kids relatively close in age was closing. But the answer remained the same. I spent a lot of time reading articles about only children and loneliness, depression, any other issues studies showed were associated with people who grew up an only child. I came up with all kinds of reasons why it was \*okay\* for my daughter not to have a sibling. Kids are expensive and time consuming. We could devote more time and money to our single child than two children. She would have to ""bury us alone"" but hopefully she'd be in her 50's or 60's with a husband and a family of her own by the time we died. I would occasionally ""relapse"" into thinking we were horrible parents for not giving our daughter a sibling. But in the end the result was I coped and found reasons to be happy with only one child. Adoption just seemed too daunting and too expensive and confusing and fraught with rules to consider.

Now my wife has changed her mind. She had a recent medical issue and thought it might be pregnancy. It was not, but the result was that she felt disappointed that she wasn't pregnant and just regular old sick. Nothing serious, fortunately. She sat me down and explained that she wanted a second kid now. Apparently now her desire to have a kid outweighed her fears of another painful pregnancy or any of the post-pregnancy problems that come with it.

I've spent the last four years convincing myself I'm okay with our situation. Financially it would be feasible, but not ideal. We don't have a third room for another child at this time, we rent an apartment, and our dream of owning a home would be that much further off, along with the lack of room for another child. I feel like an 8 year age gap virtually negates a lot of the reasons I wanted another kid in the first place. They wont share many hobbies. One child will be 16 learning to drive while the other one is still in elementary school. They wont really be of an age where playing at the park or playing with blocks is enjoyable for both of them. They may grow close older in life but there are no guarantees. My brother and I grew up 6 years apart and played a lot, had a lot of similar hobbies, but there was a definite divide due to our age. 8 years seems like it's significantly more than 6, and I ended up learning to really dislike my brother as an adult. What if we have another kid, they don't spend a lot of time together and by the time one is going to college the other is still home and we realize all the positives we had for having another kid passed us by years ago? What if they grow into adults who just plain don't like each other or connect on any real level aside from being blood relatives?

I'm sad and unsure of myself because I wanted this before. But I don't want it now. I feel like any answer is going to end in shattered expectations. We can't turn back the hands of time and have a kid earlier like I wanted which means having a second kid \*now\* wont address any of the reasons I wanted a second kid in the first place. And I can just imagine all the new losses of freedom that come with having an infant in the home all over again. But if we don't have a kid I feel like I'll be fundamentally stealing something from my wife, taking something she needs but doesn't really fit our situation anymore. I felt like I \*needed\* to have another kid, and learned to cope with the reality that it wasn't going to happen. I had a lot of sleepless nights over it. I can't imagine pushing those same anxieties on my wife. But at the same time I feel like all the benefit and positives of having a second kid have since passed us by like so many minutes on the clock.

I brought up the idea of adopting a toddler, someone closer to our daughter's age. But both of us feel more like we'd want our kids to be ours, even though plenty of kids do need loving parents and a loving home. I've spent so much time reworking my own feelings and quite frankly it's not been easy but I was coming to terms with it. Now I feel like nobody will be happy because I cannot turn back time, and if we have a kid now I may feel like it just wasn't the right decision. And if we don't, I'll feel like I've let my wife down and taken away her desire to grow our family. We are at a crossroads and I'm hoping to hear some input on the subject.","My wife wants another child after saying she didn't want another for years. (Long read)My wife and I are 28 years old.

One child will be 16 learning to drive while the other one is still in elementary school. They wont really be of an age where playing at the park or playing with blocks is enjoyable for both of them. They may grow close older in life but there are no guarantees. My brother and I grew up 6 years apart and played a lot, had a lot of similar hobbies, but there was a definite divide due to our age. 8 years seems like it's significantly more than 6, and I ended up learning to really dislike my brother as an adult. What if we have another kid, they don't spend a lot of time together and by the time one is going to college the other is still home and we realize all the positives we had for having another kid passed us by years ago? What if they grow into adults who just plain don't like each other or connect on any real level aside from being blood relatives?

I'm sad and unsure of myself because I wanted this before. But I don't want it now. I feel like any answer is going to end in shattered expectations. We can't turn back the hands of time and have a kid earlier like I wanted which means having a second kid \*now\* wont address any of the reasons I wanted a second kid in the first place. And I can just imagine all the new losses of freedom that come with having an infant in the home all over again. But if we don't have a kid I feel like I'll be fundamentally stealing something from my wife, taking something she needs but doesn't really fit our situation anymore. I felt like I \*needed\* to have another kid, and learned to cope with the reality that it wasn't going to happen. I had a lot of sleepless nights over it. I can't imagine pushing those same anxieties on my wife. But at the same time I feel like all the benefit and positives of having a second kid have since passed us by like so many minutes on the clock.

I brought up the idea of adopting a toddler, someone closer to our daughter's age. But both of us feel more like we'd want our kids to be ours, even though plenty of kids do need loving parents and a loving home. I've spent so much time reworking my own feelings and quite frankly it's not been easy but I was coming to terms with it. Now I feel like nobody will be happy because I cannot turn back time, and if we have a kid now I may feel like it just wasn't the right decision. And if we don't, I'll feel like I've let my wife down and taken away her desire to grow our family. We are at a crossroads and I'm hoping to hear some input on the subject."

How can I get my kid to follow instructions while playing sports or doing physical activities???,Parenting,5,dczc2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dczc2g/how_can_i_get_my_kid_to_follow_instructions_while/,39,1570175212.0,"My 3yo son is very physically active and also very well coordinated for his age, since he was 2 I've enrolled him in baby gymnastics class, early stimulation, dance and such, in all of which he has excelled.

For context, he goes to a Montessori preschool since he was a baby, I'm all for Montessori philosophy, which focuses on reenforcing the child's particular interests and habilities. I'm very happy with his education however, I'm starting to feel that this is a reason why he doesn't do well with structure and rules outside of school. 

It is very important for me that he engages in a physical activity so he can learn about team work, waiting turns, working for something, effort, competition, discipline etc. He has a lot of energy and I would rather he spent it having fun at this kind of activity that just bouncing on the couch at home. But it's very frustrating when he's the only child not following the program or just being generally a brat not to mention throwing my money down the garbage. 

I try to calmly talk to him about wanting turns and following instructions, but only works for a second or two, and he goes back to behaving like this, so it always ends up with us leaving in the middle of the class, embarrassed and annoyed.

Help - Wife may have choked four-year-old son?,Parenting,7,dcyg98,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dcyg98/help_wife_may_have_choked_fouryearold_son/,33,1570171001.0,"Hi. Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but here goes.

Today when we were headed to school my four year-old mentioned that my wife choked him. I found it hard to believe, but I don't know why he would make it up. I tried to get a better sense of what happened, but I couldn't get many details. He did say she didn't seem angry or sad or any of those ""bad feelings"" when she did it. I didn't get that much more info this morning.

This afternoon when I asked him after school, he said he ""thinks"" she choked him. I tried to figure out if she was doing it as a bad (joke) to express frustration but really couldn't get a sense of any her emotion or motivation. I asked him to do to me what he said she did to him, and he put his hands on my throat and choked me. I asked if he was scared and he said no, he just wanted her to stop. He also described the feeling before he demonstrated on me, and put his hands on his throat.

My wife is prescribed antidepressants and also has Ritalin in the medicine cabinet, but given the dispense date and number of pills, she's not adherent.

I'm not sure where to go next. My first thought was my brother-in-law (wife's sister's husband) but he is a physician and I know subject to reporting requirements (although I'm not sure if this is considered abuse per se). Without a good handle on what happened, I don't want to go too far down an irrevocable path.

Are there resources that can help extract the truth of the situation from my son? Should I call the National Domestic Violence Hotline, even if I'm not sure what happened? Do I address it directly with my wife, knowing she might deny it even if it did happen?

Any help would be greatly appreciated--I'm at a loss, but thinking the National Domestic Violence Hotline would be a good first step?

I don‚Äôt really know why I‚Äôm writing this. Maybe for some advice or maybe just to vent.

My son has started kindergarten this year. He has been sent home at least three times and sent to in-school suspension twice.

I cry every single day over the stress of it all. I‚Äôve had to ask to work from home, and God it was so embarrassing to tell my boss why. It‚Äôs so embarrassing when I go pick him up from school too. The teachers, counselors, principals look at me like I‚Äôm supposed to have some sort of answers for them.

He has been absolutely destroying the classroom. He throws books. He throws blocks. He tears things down from the walls. He throws the chairs. He has pulled down all the backpacks. He has emptied out boxes of small toys onto the floor. He yell-cries. No one can pinpoint his triggers.

He is absolutely defiant. When he was sent to in-school suspension for the 2nd time, he began throwing the blocks around. When the principal told him to pick it up, he refused. The principal told him that if he picks them up, he might get a chance later to play with him but if the principal has to pick them up, he won‚Äôt get that chance. My son still refused. After the principal picked up the blocks, my son had a smile on his face and said that he had hidden a block under his own foot. He‚Äôs frickin‚Äô 5 years old.

I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs perfect at home. Absolutely not. However, he has not thrown books or blocks or torn things down from the walls. If he yell-cries, I put him in a place where he can do that but cannot leave until he‚Äôs done. He has attended daycare since he was 7 weeks old. He wasn't an angel there, but I didn't get daily phone calls, and he wasn't a tornado causing destruction to everything in his path.

I‚Äôve had countless parent-teacher-counselor-principal conferences. And it‚Äôs only the 7th week into the school year. I‚Äôve had many at-length discussions with my 5 year old about the behavior. I‚Äôve discussed it many different ways. Yesterday, I made him throw away some of his toys, just as a way to try to get him to empathize with how it feels to have your own stuff destroyed. He cried at the time, but still had the same meltdown at school today.

I put away the tablets. I told him he has to behave at school for 7 days before he gets to see the tablets again.

I finally set up time for him to see a private licensed counselor. However, it‚Äôs only once a week. And the first session (which was this week) was just a one-on-one with the parent (me). 

I‚Äôve been put on the wait-list for the free school district counseling. I‚Äôve signed him up for the school ‚Äútesting,‚Äù where they test kids for learning disabilities. But they claim this could take 2-3 months. The school made an appointment for next week to start ‚ÄúResponse to Intervention‚Äù or Rtl. I‚Äôve heard that every meeting they decide on strategies to possibly help the student, but that takes time too because that strategy may not necessarily work (and they would implement it for 3-6 weeks).

It‚Äôs just soooo slow-going. I wish there was something I could do right now that could curb his behavior. It‚Äôs been escalating every single week. It‚Äôs just so stressful.

I guess perhaps what I wanted is to hear from parents who had similar issues with their young children. Some assurance that it gets better. Maybe what the issue was and how you were able to overcome it.","Off My Chest: Kindergartener is DefiantThrowaway because‚Ä¶ you know.

Having major behavioral issues with my 9 year old son and I need advice on what to do.,Parenting,4,dcytq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dcytq8/having_major_behavioral_issues_with_my_9_year_old/,5,1570172691.0,"So I am having some major behavioral issues with my son lately that is only getting progressively worse and worse and I don't know what more I can do to help him. My son opened up to me 2 months ago of the verbal, mental, and physical abuse he's been receiving at his dad's house for quite some time. His dad often calls him a ""fucker"", ""bitch"" and ""shit hole"", his dad gets in his face, he's been thrown against his bed and hit in the back, he is yelled at all the time, he gets locked in his room for hours at a time, he's been told not to talk to counselors because they didn't ""need strangers all up in their business"", and his brother is clearly favored over him. 

Since hearing that news I got him in therapy which got CPS involved. The report came out inconclusive because when the sheriff and social workers questioned my kids, they told them very little of what they told me. Now I'm working closely with his counselor, teacher, principal, and now the school counselor is also going to start seeing him weekly and I've made sure they are all aware of the situation. Since their dad and I have been fighting for custody for over a year, my lawyer is aware of the situation and there is a court investigation that has begun to look further into both of us, which I requested at our last hearing. I've really tried implementing open communication in our house and I document EVERY single thing that they tell me that happens at their dads house from now on. 

Since this school year started and I get calls from his principal and teacher on a weekly basis and he is going really downhill, really fast. His behavior has NEVER been an issue at school and he has definitely made up for lost time in this past month and a half. He has started getting into physical fights at school. He is lying constantly (ie: when he gets in trouble at school he will lie until he is blue in the face that he didn't do anything, then other kids will tell the truth, then he will start calling them liars. Even if you SEE him do something, he will lie and say he didn't.). He destroys school property.  He's become really sneaky and hides things from us (ie: not bringing his homework but tells us that he doesn't have any, every sing e day). He's always losing recess. Everything is an argument. When I talk to him about what is going on and where this anger is coming from, his response is always ""I'm angry because of dad! I hate him!"".  He's even started saying that he wants to kill himself because he hates his dad so much. I have told his therapist ALL of this and the school is completely aware as well. The lying worries me the most, because he will tell me all these things that are happening at his dad's house and I am starting to question whether or not it's true because he is lying SO MUCH lately and he never takes any accountability. I don't want to discredit what he is saying because he needs to be heard, but it's becoming a slippery slope.

Most of the time that he is getting in trouble, it's the day he is going to his dads house or the day he gets back from his house. I feel like I have done everything I could think of to help him and I need advice on what more I can do, because I am out of ideas. I've taken his things away which he doesn't seem bothered by at all, I've grounded him from video games and isn't bothered by that either. I've given him extra chores to do. I talk with him about what he is feeling without judgement and keep communication open. I've even taken him to do calming things so he can release whatever tension he is feeling. Nothing is working and his behavior is getting considerably worse. I think he just doesn't understand the emotions he is feeling and is acting out pretty intensely. Does anyone have a constructive take on this?  I need fresh ideas because my thoughts are caught up in a loop.

I should also add that their dad and I have been separated since the kids were babies. I told them last weekend that their dad and I used to be boyfriend/girlfriend and they were shocked, so that is not the issue.","Having major behavioral issues with my 9 year old son and I need advice on what to do.So I am having some major behavioral issues with my son lately that is only getting progressively worse and worse and I don't know what more I can do to help him. My son opened up to me 2 months ago of the verbal, mental, and physical abuse he's been receiving at his dad's house for quite some time. His dad often calls him a ""fucker"", ""bitch"" and ""shit hole"", his dad gets in his face, he's been thrown against his bed and hit in the back, he is yelled at all the time, he gets locked in his room for hours at a time, he's been told not to talk to counselors because they didn't ""need strangers all up in their business"", and his brother is clearly favored over him. 

Since hearing that news I got him in therapy which got CPS involved. The report came out inconclusive because when the sheriff and social workers questioned my kids, they told them very little of what they told me. Now I'm working closely with his counselor, teacher, principal, and now the school counselor is also going to start seeing him weekly and I've made sure they are all aware of the situation. Since their dad and I have been fighting for custody for over a year, my lawyer is aware of the situation and there is a court investigation that has begun to look further into both of us, which I requested at our last hearing. I've really tried implementing open communication in our house and I document EVERY single thing that they tell me that happens at their dads house from now on.

7 Year Old Cries ALL THE TIME,Parenting,9,dcrbfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dcrbfh/7_year_old_cries_all_the_time/,17,1570140127.0,"Ok. So maybe not ALL the time, but definitely too often and over things that do not warrant tears. 

Some examples of things the last two days:
1. She was telling me a knock knock joke and I talked to fast for her to properly deliver her punch line. She cried. I offered to start again and talk slower. She cried some more and said she was never going to tell me a knock knock joke again. 
2. Her sister, who is 4, talks a lot. She cried because we weren‚Äôt listening to her. I understood her frustration and sat beside her and said I was really interested in what she had to say. She cried and refused to talk. 
3. Her teacher said the burrito I folded her for lunch fell apart. She cried. 
4. Her teacher called and said my daughter had cried at school but wouldn‚Äôt tell anyone why. I asked her about it and she, at first, refused to tell me and started crying. I finally got it out of her that she had raised her hand and someone had blurted and took her turn to talk. 
5. Her gym teacher called to tell me she cried because she had to be ‚Äúit‚Äù during tag. 

These are just the last two days, and are typical days for her. There are probably more incidents, but I don‚Äôt hear about or see every one. 

At my best moments, I encourage her to emote and say how she feels and what she needs. I praise her when things go well. I compliment her hard work and her creativity. At my worst moments, like just now over the knock knock joke, I tell her that she is being ridiculous and she needs to toughen up and act like a big girl. 

I like to think that I have more good moments than bad. In my job I work with children on fostering resilience and I‚Äôm pretty good at it. I have seen growth and success with other children, many of whom are from under served neighbourhoods and newly arrived immigrant families. But with my own kid, I feel useless. 

I definitely lose my patience with her more than when I am in my professional role, and I have been working on that. It feels like things are getting worse instead of better. Her teachers said they started to call me because the crying is happening so often. School has only been in session for a month. 

I‚Äôve tried so many things. This is not new behaviour. She has been a ‚Äúcrier‚Äù since she was 3/4. Nothing has happened to instigate it that I can tell. No divorce,  no moving, no big changes. Little sister came when she was nearly 3, but they are best friends. It was well after she was born that my oldest began to show this much crying.

My mom was high in my house infront of my daughter (1yo).,Parenting,20,dcnzic,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dcnzic/my_mom_was_high_in_my_house_infront_of_my/,38,1570119965.0,"I apologise in advance if this is the wrong place for this post. 

I'm really in need of some advice. 

Alittle bit of background:
I am 26 and have a 1yo daughter. My mom was addicted to a prescription drug for more than 10years. She managed to quit about 2 years ago. 
She would do crazy and stupid things while high on it. She'd collapse on the floor while cleaning, say all sorts of nonsense, and lots of other illogical stuff. 
She gave me her drugs when I was 14 and I got hooked up on it for a couple of years. I finally got clean a few years back and regretted every single day on the amount of precious time I had wasted on this crap.

Last night:
My mom has been coming to my place on alternate days to stay over cos she's having relationship issues with my dad. 
Everything was normal until she started cleaning and doing really weird things. I had asked her to stop repeatedly. Her behaviour was just getting more and more odd and down right abnormal. She started talking in a very stone way to my daughter and spouting nonsense to her. She also ransacked my whole house, rearranging every single thing. I got so tired of asking her to stop it and didn't want to argue with her infront of my daughter. It was bed time so I brought my daughter in our room to sleep. 

The lights were completely off, pitch black. My daughter sound asleep (which was rare at 10:30pm, my mom knows how difficult it was to put her to sleep), complete silence and obvious we were sleeping. My mom barged in and asked where is the aircon remote in a loud deafening voice. She would never do this even if we were awake. It was just totally NOT what she would do normally. Even my husband was shocked and 100% sure she was high on something.

I decided it was enough when she had the tv volume up. I asked her what medicine did she take and just tell me honestly. She denied she took any medication. 

This morning, she left for work early and we needed to go for a doctor's appointment. She has misplaced every single object in the house, I couldn't find the things I need to get ready and got really pissed off. I texted her and told her to stop doing this. I asked her to come clean and again, she refused to. I told her to take her medication at her own home, please do not get high in front of my child. 

Am I being rude? I'm really lost and angry at the same time. I feel so betrayed, letting her come stay over as and when she likes, but she disrespected it by doing this. I don't know if I'm overreacting? But I know for sure I do not want my child to witness any of that. Even though she's still really small and probably doesn't know what's going on, but she's at the age where she's starting to mimic what adults do. I'm really afraid if this time its rearranging stuff in my house, what could be next? 
Could she be a danger to my daughter? 

Today she started being really cold and distant towards me. Seems like what a guilty person would do? I don't understand why couldn't she just tell me she took those meds. I am so disappointed in her. 

What should I do in this situation? :(","My mom was high in my house infront of my daughter (1yo).I apologise in advance if this is the wrong place for this post.

Bus stop drama with 6/7 year olds.,Parenting,5,dcrkln,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dcrkln/bus_stop_drama_with_67_year_olds/,18,1570141316.0,"Hey all, I wanted to know if I'm overreacting.

My daughter, who I'll refer to as Lilly, made friends with another girl about a year older than her but in the same grade (kinder) last year when they met at the bus stop. We'll call her Summer. Summer is much larger than my daughter as well as being more athletic. They began to compliment each other's personalities and encourage each other and teach each other. Lilly became more confident athletically and Summer seemed to grow her vocab and generally speak more clearly.  My daughter was placed into an ""enriched learning environment"" about half way through kinder and that's when the issues started. 

Summer started excluding Lilly from their morning soccer games  just a few days after she found out about the new class. Lilly didn't seem to care and I was just happy she wasn't playing in the road anymore. It's a very quiet unused road so it was okay but still falling down on cement sucks especially before school. I started bringing things for Lilly to play with before school or would let her use my phone instead. Summer was more interested in whatever Lilly had than soccer and Lilly shares well (to a fault, she's a bit of a pushover but we're working on that) so the rift seemed mended.

Over the break Summer came to Lilly's B-Day party and they were fine together. I got to spend more time with her parents and they were very rude to me. Insulted my baking, made unnecessary comments about how few kids came, incorrectly corrected my grandma, mother and myself on a number of subjects and wouldn't supervise or even accompany their children when we went to the playground and the riverside.

Then this year they were both placed into the gifted 1st grade class. They sat next to each other in class and on the bus and Lilly was super exited to spend more time with Summer. Then without any apparent reason Summer tells Lilly that they're not friends. Lilly was devastated and didn't even want to go to school and she loves school. While talking about friends and feelings Lilly told me she doesn't like how Summer always wants to hols her hand on the way to lunch and the bus loop because she squeezes to tight and walks to fast, or how Summer yanks her down into her seat in class. Of course I told her she needs to tell people loud and clear when you don't want them to touch you as I have before and she says Summer doesn't listen. So I asked the teacher to change Lilly's seat and left it at that because I didn't want to make a bigger deal out of it than need be. Once again they went back to being friends and Lilly was confused but happy. Friends again they'd both play together with whatever toys Lilly would bring that morning. They started drawing together in the mornings and making up this mystery game. Summer's grabby and doesn't ask before taking toys or turning the pages of Lilly's sketchbook. Summer doesn't share well in general and after a while I got fed up with it and gently corrected her behavior in front of her dad. Summer had arrived at the bus stop and taken Lilly's toy without even greeting her. I said ""remember girls, share and use your words"" and Summer's dad scowled at me over his shoulder. Without responding, and still holding Lilly's toy, Summer ran over to her dad where t hey had an intense but short whispered  conversation. She runs back up to us and announces ""My dad \*locked\* my backpack."" And then her dad hold said backpack up and shakes it at me. I was so confused I just said ""That's cute."" the bus arrived and we went our separate ways.

Yesterday Lilly got off the bus weeping and practically jumped into my arms. Summer got off the bus behind her silent and glaring. I had to carry Lilly home she was so distraught. Finally she managed to tell me what happened. Summer had snatched her pencil away and told her she was a bad drawer and drew too tiny. I know it seems like a little thing but it really hurt Lilly's feelings. To be honest Lilly is a very good artist and I'm not being biased here. She draws faces with eyebrows, lashes, irises & pupils in the eye, she draws fingers on hands. Her animal drawings are easily recognizable as they animal they're supposed to be. I could go on. I think the issue is jealousy of Lilly's general academic and artistic abilities made worse by less that great parents. I've told Lilly she doesn't have to be friends and that's okay. I reminded her of her friends who are kind. Today at the bus stop Summer's mom ignored my greeting and Summer ignored Lilly completely.

He has never had any type of routine and that's totally on me. Long story short he had always been very spirited and energetic and would never take to any structured day or night routines.

Unfortunately my hubby is gone for work sometimes over 12 hours a day so not much help there. I also have an older child that's great but also needs my attention.
Preschool was never an option to help because of finances and he only recently succeeded in using the potty. I also must mention I'm just now starting to come out of a depression fog I've been in since he was born along with bouts of alcohol issues.

I just feel lost as to where to start. Should I start slowly incorporating elements of a routine? Should I try and make up for lost time and just jump in full force?

He was the one who was there for everything - big things, little things, all the things, etc. He was there - always.  

But now that we have broken up - it is tricky.  They still have a very strong bond and love each-other very much. He has suggested still spending time with her in a scheduled manner.  I love this idea in theory because I know he would always take her when he says he would (unlike her dad) - it would give her the stability she still needs from a father figure.  Unfortunately, and selfishly, I don't think I could handle this emotionally.  I still want to be with him and I don't think I could move on in a healthy way if I still had to see him and if my daughter had a relationship with him all while he is moving on with his life without me... 

Is this extremely selfish of me? Should I still let him and my daughter have a relationship?  Or do we just cold turkey everything and she'll eventually be okay?  I know kids are super resilient but I don't want this to create bigger issues that won't arise for years...

My husband and I got one night in 3 years (our kids are 3 and 2) out and took advantage. We got caught in the moment and I had to run to the store at 1am for a Plan B. Well I just got my positive pregnancy test and I am just so upset at myself. Disappointed.

How to help my daughter (3) through trauma?,Parenting,12,dcmzwz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dcmzwz/how_to_help_my_daughter_3_through_trauma/,11,1570112674.0,"So a few months ago, I wanted a girls day with friends of mine and decided to find a babysitter. I was recommended a girl from someone I‚Äôve know for about two years and thought I could trust. When I dropped off my kids, I had a bad feeling. But I brushed it off. I asked the girl for pictures of my two kids ( 3 & 18 months) and they both looked miserable. I had a gut feeling, but when I showed my friends they didn‚Äôt seem as bothered as me so I brushed it off.... Again. 

When I picked up my kids, they were both crying. The woman who watched them literally shoved the kids at me and shut her door. My daughter (3) was hysterical üò≠ she told me in the car that the ‚Äúmean blonde girl‚Äù pushed her outside twice and kept putting her in the corner. I have a feeling there is more she can‚Äôt remember. 

This is an event she has continued to bring up since it happened in June... She even brought it up to my husband randomly tonight. So I was thinking about it, and I think she may have been legitimately traumatized by what happened. Since then, she has displayed many anxious behaviors.

I was recommended a girl from someone I‚Äôve know for about two years and thought I could trust. When I dropped off my kids, I had a bad feeling. But I brushed it off. I asked the girl for pictures of my two kids ( 3 & 18 months) and they both looked miserable. I had a gut feeling, but when I showed my friends they didn‚Äôt seem as bothered as me so I brushed it off.... Again. 

When I picked up my kids, they were both crying. The woman who watched them literally shoved the kids at me and shut her door. My daughter (3) was hysterical üò≠ she told me in the car that the ‚Äúmean blonde girl‚Äù pushed her outside twice and kept putting her in the corner. I have a feeling there is more she can‚Äôt remember. 

This is an event she has continued to bring up since it happened in June... She even brought it up to my husband randomly tonight. So I was thinking about it, and I think she may have been legitimately traumatized by what happened. Since then, she has displayed many anxious behaviors. She gets nervous when we leave the house, only likes going to certain places, and is VERY clingy. She started preschool at the beginning of the week, but has only gone 1/3 days because she‚Äôs so nervous to be there. When I picked her up from her first day, she said ‚Äúthe teachers were nice.

Going through bad or traumatic events with children by retelling them in the present tense,Parenting,5,dcnkvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dcnkvf/going_through_bad_or_traumatic_events_with/,3,1570116816.0,"I had to buy a little guidebook on dealing with children from a Scientologist to make him go away. I thought it would be good for a laugh, but sadly there's no stuff about aliens, just a lot of general advice on raising kids like you should listen to them and spend time together. Some bits are just a bit off, like the part where the banning of child labour is blamed for creating antisocial behaviour. But then again there's some hooky stuff on the leaflets that the local Jehovah's Witness guys hand out as well, mixed with messages of love and companionship.

There is one part that struck to me as really, really odd - the section on helping children deal with traumatic events.   
I've understood that Scientology doesn't think too highly of psychology or psychiatrists, and this part reads like instructions on how to give some sort of therapy to your child.

Basically it says that after your child has witnessed something bad or scary, or has had something sad happen to them, their parents should help them retell and relive the event. The parent should guide the child to remember every detail and narrate the entire sequence of events to the parent in the present tense. This should be done many times until the child is bored or laughing. They call this an assist.

There is more, but this seems to be the general procedure. Retell the event over and over again and make sure to never use the past tense. For especially traumatic events, like witnessing domestic abuse, they want the child to reenact the situation using dolls or by drawing pictures with the parent next to them asking detailed questions.

This all seems odd to me, but I know that Scientology doesn't go all in with the crazy stuff in the beginning, so maybe this is an actual technique that normal people use.

So it got me wondering, how are you supposed to help kids deal with bad experiences?","Going through bad or traumatic events with children by retelling them in the present tenseI had to buy a little guidebook on dealing with children from a Scientologist to make him go away.

Struggling with our 8yr old boy Behaving sexually with a friend,Parenting,3,dcpdwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dcpdwp/struggling_with_our_8yr_old_boy_behaving_sexually/,5,1570129929.0,"Hi there,

Throwaway because etc

My son is generally a great guy he's my best mate and we have a great relationship which is frank and straightforward, we focus on ensuring that he's not ashamed to be who he is (i was brought up by parents who were very controlling and went off the rails a bit at 18 when they didn't have legal control over me, but I was by no means insane, really just became an average 18year old, who didn't know his limits when it came to drinking). 

My son is homeschooled, but we've got a huge focus on spending time with other kids, lots of organised activities with his peers and that sort of thing so we know he gets a load of social time, and we ourselves spend time doing the things he wants to, while taking a real interest in them so that he doesn't feel like he's someone whose view isn't relevant in the home.

He has a best frind lets call him Dale, he and Dale used to meet up a couple of times a week to play in the forest together and do some woodland learning (both mums and siblings were also there), but these two boys would have their own time together. We thought it was fine and that there were no issues, but a few motnhs ago our daughter came running to her mum saying that she's seen the boys, with one of them having their penis in the other's mouth. she was shocked and confused, so we had to sit both boys down, separately and understand what was  going on and to explain that it's not okay given their age and maturity.

I had a chat with my son who was candid about it, he said that his friend Dale told him about these things because he used to have a female friend who taught him all this stuff (same age, confirmed by Dale's mum that this was why they stopped hanging out together, she thought it wasn't a problem anymore because Dale has come leaps and bounds since then).

After we had a chat, I'd explained that it's not okay to do this, and he went on to explain that it's happened a few times and the sorts of stuff they did, I explained that they could get ill etc from some of the things he described and it's not appropriate.

I'm glad to say it's not happened again, but I've been made aware from his friend's mum (via my wife) that Dale has said a few times since (they've started hanging around again recently after a hiatus driven by all of this), that our son has been asking if he will do it again, or if he can. Now the problem we're facing is that:

1) My son has had it explained to him a couple of times now that respecting someone's boundaries is extremeley important, and just because someone has already said no, it doesn't mean that they will change their mind out of choice if you keep asking them (hope that makes sense).
2) We really don't know how to approach this, because we want him to have and enjoy his privacy, but we can't do it in good faith with other kids too, because what if this is something we can't come back from? And he begins behaving sexually with other kids?
3) I'm sometimes afraid that he might do something to his sister if this is a compulsion (I check on them several times at night just in case). Nothing about who he is makes me feel like he's capable of hurting his sister, he has a ton of compassion, and empathy, and honesty, but as a victim of abuse myself as a kid I would be mortified if my on was doing it myself (that's probably projecting).

I'm terrified that despite trying to have an open and honest relationship with my son, where I remind him consistently that I'm here for him, and there's nothing he can do that would make me think less of him, I feel like a failure and it's eating me alive.

This is why I'm reaching out, I've never used this particular sub before, but I'm hoping someone here can help me and my wife.

 Now i know that kids can be difficult, I'm sure we can all say amen to that lol, but with my little man I feel like there may be something else. He struggles at school majorly, he is the only kid that has one to one and he doesn't follow the class structure as he doesn't do well with sitting down and learning but much better with practical learning.

The school itself has absolutely bent over backwards to help my boy and the start of this school year, I had seen some massive improvements in his behaviour and the fact he would walk into class without needing me to come in with him or just generally behaving well at school. 

But over the past two weeks I feel like we have taken 50 steps back. Hes kicking off at school everyday now, he had to spend the entire day with the head teacher on Monday, hes not getting as involved as he was with school work and with the other kids, hes not listening at school again and just can get quite spiteful with his teachers.

Now i know this may seem like i may be blowing the situation up more than it is, i dont know as I'm not great at parenting to be honest and doesn't have family around to ask for advice, but I worry so much that I'm failing him as a dad and I really dont know what I can do to help. The situation is made even more difficult as me and his mum are not together and as much as we get on, it's very much her way or the high way with parenting and I feel like I cant make enough impact because I'm not around enough as I work full time. I'm not saying shes a bad mum just that she can be soft with him. I feel like I could install abit of discipline or something in him but because I'm not there enough I cant spend enough time with him to make a difference. 

I'm at such a loss and feel like such a bad parent for not being able to instill a positive change in my sons life. I also dont want him ending up either being ostrised by the other kids or hated on because he always gets treated differently. I dont have any problem with finding different ways to help deal with his behaviour and such, I just dont want him to feel different but his mum seems to think that's a good thing in a way.......

I dont know, I'm so all over the place with it and hoped random people of the internet could help in some way or another.

Essentially a 9-year-old baby,Parenting,13,dciri7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dciri7/essentially_a_9yearold_baby/,11,1570088865.0,"Hey everyone. This is my first post on here. I am very desperate. 

I‚Äôm a single mom who‚Äôs trying very hard to raise a 9-year-old kiddo (she‚Äôs turning 10 in January). She‚Äôs in fifth grade and essentially, like what the title says, she‚Äôs a 9-year-old baby. 

She‚Äôs had a nanny since she was born so I could cope up with going to college and finishing my degree. This nanny has been with the family since I was a kid so she‚Äôs essentially family. Along the line, during her younger elementary years, I noticed that she‚Äôs started becoming more dependent and less aware of her actions. Like she‚Äôs just passing right through her life. She doesn‚Äôt realize the importance of education, and of being independent. She doesn‚Äôt know how to tie her shoes, wear her socks, shower on her own, brush her hair, all of these simple tasks that should be muscle memory by now, but she doesn‚Äôt know it. And it‚Äôs all because the nanny thinks it‚Äôs faster if she does it. 

Now the nanny keeps hounding me on tutoring the kid even if my kid doesn‚Äôt even tell me if there‚Äôs anything due or if she needs to study something. Again, she‚Äôs very passive and seems like she doesn‚Äôt even care sometimes. 

I‚Äôm getting so frustrated because she doesn‚Äôt look like she wants anything else but to use her iPad (which I confiscated indefinitely) and play all day. She‚Äôs 9!!!!!! Can I just reiterate that?!

I was planning to do a full weekend of independence crash courses like how to do things on her own and be able to just do things. It‚Äôs absolutely horrid and sad because she‚Äôs a smart cookie but is failing her classes because of her neglect. 

I also think the nanny‚Äôs babying her too much and making her dependent. I believe I‚Äôm at fault for letting it go on for so long and for not teaching her earlier on (nanny mentality coming from my mom). And I also think that she needs to have her own motivation to do things. Please help!!! I‚Äôm so desperate and lost and frustrated. I need neeed neeeed to help my kid!

Ex wants to send daughter to a different high school to the plan,Parenting,2,dco6dy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dco6dy/ex_wants_to_send_daughter_to_a_different_high/,18,1570121450.0,"We've 2 kids, 14M, 10F. I live (we all used to live) a 5 minute walk from a good primary and secondary school here in the UK. Moved here specifically for that reason. Divorce meant their mother moved about 3 miles away, through town. I have them every wednesday night and Fri / Sat / every fortnight, school to school. 

My Son is 2 years from finishing at the secondary / high school (they have a 6th form though...) , and Daughter is in her last year at primary. Despite it not happening in the end with my son, ex wants to send daughter to a different school than the perfectly good one absurdly close to my house, the one where all her friends will be going. Originally we were trying to get a scholarship to a girls grammar school, which seemed reasonable, however she didn't pass the exams. Now she is looking to send her to another one, pretty much equidistant to both of us, again about 3 miles away. A nice little triangle of awkward bus rides, car pickups, taxis or whatever.

I went to an open day at this new school, had a tour round, and I thought it looked like a really bad idea to send her there. Whilst it's a good enough ""nearest"" school, it seems in no way better than the local one here, and only adds complications. It's not well maintained, lots of broken windows and poorly maintained buildings (which... TBH that's not unexpected on average, but it's not exactly a positive.) Outside of the quality of education, which I understand is good, there is also the delicate issue of the pupils... I hope it is understandable to comment on the fact that the pupils of this girls school are 95%+ black and asian (the vast majority of pupils wear the Hijab), and my daughter is very white, and very ginger, and very socially awkward at times. Our local community is very different to this more inner city area, but is still happily multicultural, indeed there's more variety here, she would barely see anyone her own age that looks like her at this other school.

My position is probably pretty transparent here. And like me, my daughter wants to go to the school that all her friends will go to. And she wants to go to a school with boys. She wants to play football with her mates at lunchtime, and generally finds better friends in boys than girls. And yes, \*I\* want her to go to the school near me too, it makes sense, it makes life easier for everyone being able to trivially walk back to a home, even if it's not the one they'll be spending the night in (Although it IS the one where their baby half-sister, who adores them both, lives).

In many ways, their mother always comes across as a control freak. Despite us getting on so well over the last few years, she will never deviate from the legal arrangements, and just subtly tries to exert her control over the situation, not letting the kids come back here to see their little sister for 10 minutes and ME driving them back to their house, saving her the commute etc. It all just seems to be about her getting her way, even though, of course, she always phrases it as doing what's best for the children - typically the most inconvenient solution is framed as the best, as anything convenient must be somehow selfish and wrong. And she was always this way when we were together, we could NEVER have a babysitter when the big kids were small. Could never ask a friend, despite them offering to do so, as we'd then owe someone something, which was wrong... and I'm waffling... sorry.

So I want to object. I want to have my daughter go to the local school, just as she wants to, with her friends... but am I being a selfish prick to finally draw that line against my ex's position?","Ex wants to send daughter to a different high school to the planWe've 2 kids, 14M, 10F.

My Son is 2 years from finishing at the secondary / high school (they have a 6th form though...) , and Daughter is in her last year at primary. Despite it not happening in the end with my son, ex wants to send daughter to a different school than the perfectly good one absurdly close to my house, the one where all her friends will be going. Originally we were trying to get a scholarship to a girls grammar school, which seemed reasonable, however she didn't pass the exams. Now she is looking to send her to another one, pretty much equidistant to both of us, again about 3 miles away. A nice little triangle of awkward bus rides, car pickups, taxis or whatever.

I went to an open day at this new school, had a tour round, and I thought it looked like a really bad idea to send her there. Whilst it's a good enough ""nearest"" school, it seems in no way better than the local one here, and only adds complications. It's not well maintained, lots of broken windows and poorly maintained buildings (which... TBH that's not unexpected on average, but it's not exactly a positive.) Outside of the quality of education, which I understand is good, there is also the delicate issue of the pupils... I hope it is understandable to comment on the fact that the pupils of this girls school are 95%+ black and asian (the vast majority of pupils wear the Hijab), and my daughter is very white, and very ginger, and very socially awkward at times. Our local community is very different to this more inner city area, but is still happily multicultural, indeed there's more variety here, she would barely see anyone her own age that looks like her at this other school.

My position is probably pretty transparent here. And like me, my daughter wants to go to the school that all her friends will go to. And she wants to go to a school with boys. She wants to play football with her mates at lunchtime, and generally finds better friends in boys than girls. And yes, \*I\* want her to go to the school near me too, it makes sense, it makes life easier for everyone being able to trivially walk back to a home, even if it's not the one they'll be spending the night in (Although it IS the one where their baby half-sister, who adores them both, lives).

In many ways, their mother always comes across as a control freak. Despite us getting on so well over the last few years, she will never deviate from the legal arrangements, and just subtly tries to exert her control over the situation, not letting the kids come back here to see their little sister for 10 minutes and ME driving them back to their house, saving her the commute etc. It all just seems to be about her getting her way, even though, of course, she always phrases it as doing what's best for the children - typically the most inconvenient solution is framed as the best, as anything convenient must be somehow selfish and wrong. And she was always this way when we were together, we could NEVER have a babysitter when the big kids were small. Could never ask a friend, despite them offering to do so, as we'd then owe someone something, which was wrong... and I'm waffling... sorry.

So I want to object. I want to have my daughter go to the local school, just as she wants to, with her friends... but am I being a selfish prick to finally draw that line against my ex's position?"
My 6 year old son has a super dramatic response to being yelled at!,Parenting,3,dcmi1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dcmi1j/my_6_year_old_son_has_a_super_dramatic_response/,11,1570109153.0,"tl;dr. Son rarely gets in trouble. He‚Äôs never been spanked. When he gets spoken to with a sharp tone, he has a meltdown. Like he‚Äôs been beat. Advice?


But please, before you crucify me for ever yelling at my child, let me just give you the context. He is an only child. He is homeschooled. This behavior cropped up recently this past summer when we were home a lot and he didn‚Äôt have as many social interactions with other kids. I only mention this because I wonder if the fewer social interactions attributed to the behavior. The kid really is almost an angel. He‚Äôs never been spanked because there was literally never any cause to spank him. My partner and I are both fairly chill. We rarely raise our voices even with each other during an argument. So my son doesn‚Äôt hear yelling often at all. He has always been sensitive to loud noises though. Since he was a baby. Loud kids. Loud groups of people. Loud laughing (he hates my laugh). That kind of thing. I have noticed that the very few times he has been yelled at by one of us, he just has this total meltdown. Can‚Äôt breathe, panic attack kind of thing. Just sobbing in between it all. Well, I‚Äôve noticed that now (Since the summer) when I even get just a sharp tone with him, he has the same reaction. Or when he does something wrong (meaning, something he thinks he should get in trouble for) he starts to meltdown. This is coming from a child who never even threw tantrums as a toddler. I feel like my attempts to calm him down make it worse. The things I WANT to say are to chill out and stop being so sensitive. But I love his sensitivity and I know that I can‚Äôt pick and choose when it is ok for him to be sensitive! So I don‚Äôt use the word disparagingly around him. How can I help him calm down a bit around sharper tones? I use a sharper tone because he is needing redirection for something. It‚Äôs not like a flippant thing. I‚Äôm worried that when he does go to public school and gets onto sports teams, he won‚Äôt be able to handle a sharper atmosphere or critique. Any suggestions would so very much appreciated! Or if I‚Äôm not in the right sub, point me elsewhere, please.","My 6 year old son has a super dramatic response to being yelled at!tl;dr. Son rarely gets in trouble. He‚Äôs never been spanked.

I was with a man for 18 months, married for 6 months, and became pregnant. We are now divorced. Domestic violence has no impact on parenting time, so I have to parent our daughter with him and see him/communicate with him regularly. I reported him for domestic violence and he was convicted but now his 18 month sentence is over. All in all, our daughter who is 3, is happy, bright, loving and kind. But it's me where I need some help. I wanted to reach out to you all. Here's my journal entry tonight. TIA for any advice or words of encouragement...

Journal entry, October 2, 2019

I don‚Äôt know how to co-parent my child with the man who strangled me when I was 9 months pregnant. The man who broke the dining room chair, or the man who smashed my laptop against the brick fireplace when he got angry one night. The man who would get upset when I questioned him, or when I tried to talk about why we weren‚Äôt doing well and then would blame me for trying to talk to him about these things. The man who screamed at me while I was cornered in the bathroom, pregnant, scared and crying. This was also the same man that apologized in between all of these rageful moments, telling me he knew it was his fault, he didn‚Äôt know why he was like this, etc. I believed him but then it would just start all over again like some sick manipulative game. I stayed in it for a total of 18 months, and the worst of it was when I became pregnant when it felt ‚Äútoo late‚Äù to back out then.

I don‚Äôt really know how to be a parent (I really do wish there were a manual). Every day, some new hard lesson arises. When my daughter wakes up in the morning, I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm going to get cranky toddler who pushes me away and asks for space, or sweet toddler who wants to snuggle but I try to remain boundaries, set limits and maintain a sense of calm through it all. Sometimes I lose it and I yell but I never hit. When I yell, I say I‚Äôm sorry, or take a visibly deep breath in front of her, or tell her ‚ÄúMommy needs to take a break to calm down‚Äù. I always come back and repair with her. And I always talk to her about what had just happened, and we talk about what we should do next time. It always ends up with an ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry because \_\_\_\_\_\_\_‚Äù from each of us, and a hug.

I don‚Äôt know how to heal from the trauma from my abusive relationship--my short-lived marriage with a man whom I thought immediately was ‚Äúthe one‚Äù; who was charming, attractive, and who often made me feel safe. A man who promised me everything. A big, large, strong man who, when he held me, made me feel like the most protected human on the planet. When things were good, they were incredible. But when things were bad, they were worse than I think hell could be. It felt so confusing to be riding a rollercoaster from week to week or sometimes, from day to day. I‚Äôd never experienced this before, so, why not give it a shot. It couldn‚Äôt be that bad. It‚Äôs just his own childhood trauma haunting him, but he would never hurt me, right? He will heal. Right? I would often call his mother and seek out help because he didn‚Äôt know how to help himself and I didn‚Äôt know how to help him. Because several times, I would find him with a knife to his wrist, or a door kicked down, or my car beat up inside because he got mad. I started to think it was all my fault. He made me believe--he told me--that I was an abuser, too. I started to believe him. I questioned myself and my ‚Äúgood-ness‚Äù. I started to argue back, and once, I had slapped him so hard in the face because I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I‚Äôve never slapped anyone. I‚Äôve never harmed a living thing before in my life. I called the cops because I was scared and needed help, and then I was handcuffed and forced to leave my 12 week old baby for a night and a day in jail.

I don‚Äôt know how to stop the images from popping up in my mind these days. I am brought back for a split-second to a moment in time where there was awful rage from my ex. Perhaps it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve had to see him for exchanges with our child now that his probation is over.

I don‚Äôt know how to date, or sustain the relationship I am in with a kind, supportive, understanding, and emotionally healthy man I met when my daughter was 1.5 years old. Relationships are supposed to be a trust-filled bond, where you are each supposed to put energy into it. I don‚Äôt have any energy. I take care of my daughter on my ‚Äúoff days‚Äù, which are mostly wonderful but also trying, and then I work on the other days. One day a week, my daughter is with her dad all day and I do get some time to myself. During that time, I clean my house and try to find time for self-care but I‚Äôm so tired or worn out emotionally, that I end up not doing it. I just don‚Äôt know how or if I can do it right now. And I also don‚Äôt want to necessarily let go fully of the man I‚Äôve been seeing for over a year.

I see a wonderful therapist who has gotten me through the last three years. I‚Äôve started to heal, learned to set and hold boundaries with my ex. But I still get messages from my ex at least once a week blaming me for something, or criticising me for something. I know I do not have to respond, so I do not. But I cannot escape it. How do I escape it? I‚Äôm boundaried now. I‚Äôm strong. But am I this strong? Is it always going to be this way? I am forced to communicate with him and see him for exchanges. His probation is over (I reported him to the police for DV in 2017 but his sentence is over), so I know have to figure out how to do all of this. I have to figure out how to see his face whilst feeling disgusted by him, how to sound calm in front of our daughter when I‚Äôm rageful inside, how to sit during parent-teacher conferences while needing \[more than anything in the world\] a planet between us.

Environmentally conservative crafts,Parenting,21,dcdfny,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dcdfny/environmentally_conservative_crafts/,41,1570066137.0,"Hi, Parents! I keep thinking about how wasteful kid crafts seem to me. My kids are still under 3, but they like to color or otherwise make crafts using paper, buttons, foam, whatever. And I know the amount of crafts and paper-usage will only increase as they become school age. 

I dont really mind coloring books or notebooks, but I have a really hard time wanting to do crafts with my toddler. I just feel like it's a waste of money to buy supplies to make something that's going to end up in the trash. But I also strongly feel that art is important for children (and adults). 

So, am I over thinking this? Are there crafts that you enjoy doing that dont feel environmentally irresponsible or overly expensive? Is there a good way to use some crafts more than once?

My husb is very levelheaded, loving and patient but has expressed to me in the past that he can become angry out of frustration and has times where it feels like he 'snaps' or something switches in his brain and he can lash out.
We've been married for 5 years and I've never seen his get anywhere near to that point but I know it's something he's worried about with the baby.
We're both extremely tired and today was really hard with the baby not settling after seemingly having done everything and I went to the toilet while he was getting the baby dressed and when I came back husb said he felt that anger like rage and was so worried and upset that he was going to hurt the baby (nothing happened, but the thought alone made him very emotional and he felt so guilty).
I said that next time he needs to put the baby down and just walk away and tell me what's going on before he gets to that point, but we both agreed that he probably needs to seek help about this. He is so worried and really beating himself up about it so I thought I'd see if anyone has ever had experience with this or advice on what steps to take.","First time parent advice - anger out of frustrationHi guys, my husb and I had a baby recently and I wanted to know if anyone has had experience with anger out of frustration.

Now I am totally ok with him helping his mom, not the family watching the kids.

His mom had a stroke which makes her unable to physically watch my children. She wouldn't be able to pick up the  baby if he needed it, which he will. The SIL sees my kids maybe 5 hours a month at most and spends most of that time on her phone. While her husband was overseas for the military, she had quit working due to the stress of having her kids by herself. She couldnt handle it all. She has also made comments about the baby not wanting to see her and that he just cries when he does. Probably because they arent around? The cousins coming? I dont even know them enough to trust them with my kids. It's like sitting my kids with strangers. Not that they're not nice, but still. 

My middle child would be fine. She knows them enough because they used to be around more. Shes also really outgoing and just loves everything.  So does my oldest, however, he doesnt love SIL and is hard to manage due to ADHD and severe anxiety. This week has been bad for him. Hes completely shut himself off to our family.

He also cannot have dairy and I am nervous that someone will give it to him.on accident, although the stranger thing and all these people get me more nervous.

4yo issues transitioning to school,Parenting,4,dchwkt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dchwkt/4yo_issues_transitioning_to_school/,15,1570084961.0,"Hey all, first time poster here, looking for any help I can possibly get.  There may be multiple issues compounding here.  Let me know your thoughts!

So, 4yo just started school this fall.  She was still napping once per day before school started (we tried eliminating them,  it she either crashes late in the afternoon or goes to bed early, which is preferable).  We‚Äôre now a month into school and she still hasn‚Äôt adjusted.  She still crashes most days after school while I‚Äôm cooking supper.  She‚Äôs very difficult to wake up once she‚Äôs asleep too.  It takes a good 20 min to wake her up enough where she‚Äôll respond to questions like ‚Äúare you hungry‚Äù and it can take practically jumping on the bed beside her to get her to that level of awareness.  

Today, I got a note home from school from the teacher saying they‚Äôre having issues getting her to do things she is absolutely capable of doing (such as putting on her jacket) and she‚Äôs having major meltdowns.  She also refuses to use the bathroom there (which we knew, from her, is because they have auto flush toilets that she says are too loud) even with paper over the sensor.  I wrote a note back saying we knew about the toilet issue and have been encouraging her to brave, even though we know it‚Äôs scary and loud, and the two times she‚Äôs told us she did use it we praised her like crazy and told her how proud we are of her.  As for the meltdowns, I‚Äôve asked whether or not they are consistently in the afternoons, as that may be related to the sleep struggles.  I‚Äôve also asked about ideas/strategies as we‚Äôre not sure what to do to help.  This note will go back to school tomorrow, but I thought I‚Äôd try to get a head start on ideas from you lovely folks.  

If anyone has any ideas or suggestions at all, please let me know!  Thanks!","4yo issues transitioning to schoolHey all, first time poster here, looking for any help I can possibly get.  There may be multiple issues compounding here.  Let me know your thoughts!

My previous posts have been about the anger and frustration with homework - it was an all out war to get her to do anything. Stomping, tears, screaming, throwing stuff, banging her head on the table. It was super great over the summer going through therapy, learning coping skills, and she had barely any issues!!

Then school started again. It always starts with me asking her to do the homework. Eye roll, books slam, the huffing and puffing begin. I try and pick my battles, I really do. I understand homework is frustrating and is boring and sucks. I was in school like 2 years ago.

This always get her sooooo angry, but like I don‚Äôt know how else to help her at that point without giving her the answers. I ask her to walk me through the entire question.

"My toddler seems to be getting hurt a lot in daycare. Unsure how to proceed, looking for advice.",Parenting,6,dccoa5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dccoa5/my_toddler_seems_to_be_getting_hurt_a_lot_in/,12,1570062813.0,"I'm a mother of one child.  He's just barely 2, and he's been in this childcare center since he was three months old. 

I've always had reservations about it, but there's not much I can do as I have to work and so does my spouse.  They're a licensed center with glowing reviews and a lot of local awards.  My spouse is the 'pick up parent' as I work graves so I rarely go in and see them; I've even had the owner inquire who I was because I am so scarcely there to pick my son up. 

He has a very strong bond with his infant teacher and I thought it was fantastic.  Once he turned 2 they moved him to a new classroom, and he has been getting bruise after bruise from falling.  When a child gets hurt they fill out an ""ouch"" report, which again I don't see, my partner looks at them (not sure why he doesn't bring them home, or if they have to stay at school, but I digress...)

In the past few weeks he's had three really bad, intense bruises to his face and forehead, and one laceration that's deep that runs about an inch across his right cheek.  He got a HUGE busted lip that looked gnarly for a week straight, he could barely eat the first few days.  I was pretty upset with this, because the most recent incident wasn't documented or told to my husband until the next morning, they were ""so busy"" they forgot to tell him/give him the report.  

Fast forward...today at work I get a call from the owner and she tells me that my son has fallen, from running, and that he's okay but bumped his head and since it's a head injury they're legally required to inform a parent.  Um, okay...so why are you calling me *now*? I've never gotten a call from them, even when he has had injuries in the past.  She says that she doesn't have an updated number for my husband.  Which is ridiculous, as he's literally in and out three or four times a week TWICE A DAY.  

I mentioned that I'd never heard of this since nobody ever called me before and she just brushed it off and that was that. 

Now I'm furious, because I feel like either they're ignoring protocols in the first place, or at the very least are ridiculously inconsistent.  I called my husband after and he confirmed that the last time they contacted him over an injury was when our son was an infant.  

Admittedly I don't know how frequent 2 year olds get ouch reports or hit their heads because this is the first one I've had.  I expect it's pretty frequent, but I worry that there's some kind of caretaker neglect going on for him to be this banged and beaten up constantly.  He's got good balance around the house and hardly ever falls on his own.  When he does he definitely doesn't end up with gigantic bruises or cuts on his face.

I'm going to request a meeting with them to look over these reports and probably ream them on their lackadaisical standards for parent communication....but please tell me, am I being a ridiculous helicopter parent?  Is this really normal?  Any advice offered is appreciated.","My toddler seems to be getting hurt a lot in daycare. Unsure how to proceed, looking for advice.I'm a mother of one child.

I am a lover of nature and preservation of it. I was excited about all the benefits that he could get out of learning from nature documentaries. At first we watched BBC's Planet Earth and Blue Plane series together and some other random nature shows here and there. He became very interested. Recently he, by himself, decided to use his allotted screen time to watch Netflix's ""Our Planet"" series. 

Turns out in these series the message of doom and gloom is rather strong and very depressing even for an adult. In an effort to alert viewers about the dire status of climate change, the narrator often takes sharp turns from describing something quite beautiful to a dooms day message about how this might be the last we see such and such. Pornographic close ups of polar bears hunting a baby seal, Walruses diving off of a cliff to death, bleaching corals; long shots of Indonesian forests turned into palm forests accompanied by sensational narration of how all those things are the fault of climate change and how those beautiful Orangutans you just saw might be the last in the nature, etc, etc.

The 3rd episode I turned off the TV 10 minutes before the show was over. 15 minutes into the fourth episode the kid literally broke into tears while repeating things like: what can we do? from polar ice cap to coral reefs to forests everything is getting destroyed. What can we do?

I told him some soothing things about how his generation will surely be more responsible than mine and they  will hopefully find a solution but I think I was mostly lying and I think it wasn't enough.

She has been a dancer since she was 2, they both are.  Our high school system has a arts & tech speciality program and she has always planned on going to that.  She wants to continue to after school, and hopefully get a dance scholarship to college.  She did a tour yesterday and came home all excited about the cosmetology program there, and that is what she wants to do.  My wife and I are beside ourselves.  She said this would be a backup for after she is done dancing.

Our biggest issue is that there is plenty of opportunity for cosmetology education later in life, but she would be passing up on other opportunities now to persue that.  Closing doors in exchange for one that will never be closed and is readily available.   I told her that I have always enthusiastically supported her, and it should tell her something that we are not enthusiastic about this.  We want her to really think long term big picture about this, but she is a 13 year old who likes pretty primping and painting nails.

So, does anyone have any advice.  Right now we are at the point of apply for every program that you have any interest in, and  pick one later after more research.  She is pretty bummed out that we are not on board with this.

Thanks.

EDIT:  people seem to be misunderstanding, so I will try to clarify.  We are not high pressure dance parents.  Please remove any ""dance moms"" stereo types from your mind's.  We support and encourage her dancing, but never have pressured her to do more than she wants.  We are also not doing that now.  We have not even suggested the performing arts path at the school.  We feel that the opportunity for cosmetology education will be there later, there are half a dozen training centers for adults in our city.

To do that path NOW though, she is sacrificing traditional education l, which closes doors.  She is sacrificing other specialized programs at the center, which closes doors, for a door that will be open later in life.  

She has never expressed interest in cosmetology before yesterday, and is trying to make a big decision based on a short presentation and her emotions.

I hope that helps","How do we guide our daughter?My wife and I are raising two incredible daughters we have made lots of great choices so far and now we fear our oldest, 13, is making a poor choice.

We support and encourage her dancing, but never have pressured her to do more than she wants.  We are also not doing that now.  We have not even suggested the performing arts path at the school.  We feel that the opportunity for cosmetology education will be there later, there are half a dozen training centers for adults in our city.

To do that path NOW though, she is sacrificing traditional education l, which closes doors.  She is sacrificing other specialized programs at the center, which closes doors, for a door that will be open later in life.  

She has never expressed interest in cosmetology before yesterday, and is trying to make a big decision based on a short presentation and her emotions.

I hope that helps"
activity anxiety??,Parenting,1,dcjwi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dcjwi7/activity_anxiety/,1,1570094419.0,"Hello,

&#x200B;

My 5-year-old daughter is scared at the start of activities. For example, she loves her ballet lessons and talks about them for a whole week, but at the start of the lessons she is crying a lot. After 5 minutes it's over and she likes it again. The same with swimming lessons and today there was a school running contest in which she absolutely wanted to participate. Days she was already planning not to forget that everything would be in order before the start. Everything was fine but she missed the start because when it was time to go to the starting area she got so scared and didn't stop crying. She chooses these activities herself and we don't impose any expectations on her. 

&#x200B;

It seems as if some kind of fear is overwhelming her, it is partly a kind of separation anxiety but she has this for example much less at school. Does anyone recognize this and how can we deal with it. I am not overly worried, but would have the right approach that it does not get worse.

Anyone ever successfully sleep train a 3yo?,Parenting,0,dcj8v3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dcj8v3/anyone_ever_successfully_sleep_train_a_3yo/,15,1570091213.0,"Bedtime is killing me. My 3yo has always been difficult to get to sleep and my biggest regret has been not sleep training.  
Am I too late? At this point I‚Äôm even willing to spend the money on a sleep consultant if it actually guaranteed he‚Äôd sleep. 

The only way I‚Äôm actually able to get him to sleep in under an hour (and at a reasonable time) is if I take him on drives around our town because he‚Äôs strapped in the car seat, but this is obviously not sustainable and just not good for so  many reasons. 

His current evening routine: 
Dinner, (bath every other night), pjs, brush teeth, books, eventually sleep.

My frustrations with his sleep have actually gotten worse since the summer when he started waking up at 6:30AM every morning. It didn‚Äôt matter how late he‚Äôd go down. Blackout curtains weren‚Äôt helpful. I hoped that once the sun was rising later he‚Äôd be sleeping in longer, but he‚Äôs still getting up at 6:30. The kid‚Äôs a machine.

Unfortunately he needs 12 hours of sleep. Anything less than 10.5 hours and it‚Äôs a rough day when he wakes up.

Anyone have any success training a 3yo or older to sleep on their own in their own bed? How did you do it? Anyone have any recommendations for a sleep consultant who can work remotely and is a wizard at getting toddlers to sleep?

"Struggling 5th grader, and a toddler who stole your thunder.",Parenting,1,dcj74j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dcj74j/struggling_5th_grader_and_a_toddler_who_stole/,23,1570090974.0,"So my wife and I have a son who is 10, and daughter who is about to turn 3.  

Short version of the story is that our son is struggling in 5th grade, which is kind of par for the course with him over the past few years. 

Kinder through 2nd grade he was an all star in school. Made honor roll and everything. But it was in a school district that was not known to be the best academically, compared to others in our area. 

So we did what we thought at the time was a great decision, and moved to an area that is known to have excellent schools. 

In 3rd grade he struggled a bit to get on the same reading level as others in his class. But he was strong in everything else. So no major concerns... but we got him a tutor over the summer to help with his reading.

4th grade came and it was the same story, but now it was more than just reading that he was struggling with. So we found him some tutoring to help again. But he still barely got by, and his teachers suggested that he was riding the line of possibly needing held back. They basically said he‚Äôs ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù to pass, but that it was up to us. We decided that socially we didn‚Äôt want him to go through the possible embarrassment of being held back a grade. So we chose to let him move forward to 5th.

So here we are only a couple of months into 5th grade, and of course, he‚Äôs failing multiple classes. 

A lot of it seems to be due to the fact that he just doesn‚Äôt listen or pay attention, and easily forgets about assignments and tests. Which as a parent is a bit frustrating because then we have to be the ‚Äúbad guys‚Äù and force him to do his homework and take away privileges like playing outside with his friends if he forgets to finish assignments by their due date.

So currently he‚Äôs in his bedroom, upset with his mother for telling him he can‚Äôt play with his friends until he gets his grades up. I feel this is a fair deal, because he‚Äôs not incapable. He just lacks the ability to focus on what‚Äôs important, and more concerned with the ‚Äúfun‚Äù activities of his day. 

We have had him tested multiple times for different types of learning disorders, and to date he has never tested positive for any type of learning disorder at all. 

The part that makes this even more difficult/challenging to deal with is that he sees his 3 year old sister get to play and have fun, and he thinks we are treating him like we don‚Äôt love him as much as we love her. Which obviously isn‚Äôt the case, he‚Äôs just at a much different point of his childhood than she is, so it‚Äôs 2 completely different parenting styles, all in one. 

He doesn‚Äôt understand that when his sister is his age we will have the same expectations from her as we have with him now. And furthermore, he was treated the exact same way we treat her, when she was her age. 

TLDR; 5th grader struggles in class and thinks we‚Äôre being hard on him while his toddler sister gets to have fun and play.","Struggling 5th grader, and a toddler who stole your thunder.So my wife and I have a son who is 10, and daughter who is about to turn 3.

8 year old daughter highly sensitive to gentle correction,Parenting,2,dce331,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dce331/8_year_old_daughter_highly_sensitive_to_gentle/,8,1570069008.0,"Hello again, reddit.

Step-dad (to be) of an awesome 8 year old girl trying to see if anyone else has found effective ways to help a kid through this.

The bio-dad (now out of the picture since she was 5, though she visits him for a week at a time a couple times a year) used to be an excessive yeller (I obviously wasn't around for this, but I'm told it was very aggressive and came complete with namecalling/insults).

Neither myself nor my fiance are yellers (barring emergency situations/danger), but when I correct our daughter on something, as gently as possible, she'll frequently have a mini-meltdown (going into a corner, curling up into a ball to hide her face, and crying).  She'll usually be fine again after a few minutes, but I'm trying to think if there's anything I can be doing to help her get over this sensitivity.

For an example:  I read to her at bedtime for a half hour or so every night.  Last night, I agreed to read an extra second chapter to her if she agreed to clear up her floor a little as I did.  I proceed to start reading, she proceeds to get more art/craft supplies and start another project on the floor.  I reminded her (gently) about the deal, she muttered a 'sorry' and kept on going, and then I reminded her again (neutral tone, matter-of-fact) that we can't do a second chapter if she doesn't start clearing up.  This sent her straight into a quick ""I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry"", then into a curled up ball of tears in the corner.  Broke my heart a bit, but I don't know the best way to respond.  I comforted her (as I'm inclined to in these situations) while reminding her it wasn't a big deal and I'm not mad, just reminding her what she needs to be doing.  Any effective strategies?

Since her wish aligned with her brother's, I told opting to politics would be wise but she preferred to do it through plants.

I must say, it's kind of scary to have them wanting what they do.

I have a bit of a situation I‚Äôm at a loss for dealing with (on account of not having parents I can talk to)

The little one is 7.5 and has been doing something odd as of late. I‚Äôll start by saying it isn‚Äôt a big deal yet, but I‚Äôd like to start getting things ready before it is

Last Monday, I got a text from my ex saying the little one felt like they weren‚Äôt being heard by me. She also said my daughter mentioned I had called her a name but to the best of my ability, I don‚Äôt remember ever doing so or using that word.

Now I should start by saying prior to this text, everything was good. When I last saw my daughter (4 days ago) she had exclaimed how happy she was and general pleasantries towards my parenting. We‚Äôve even had a weekly tradition of having juice and cookies together and discussing how both of us did as a mom and daughter the week prior and if there‚Äôs something we can improve on.

When I finally spoke to my daughter on the phone,  she was initially reluctant to say anything, but eventually came back with the answer that she just wanted to play more hide and seek. That was it. My ex seems to think it‚Äôs because I sleep in late on account of my work schedule (I‚Äôm usually in bed by 4 am), but I‚Äôve often asked the little one if that‚Äôs ever a problem, and have made sure to sleep on the couch while they play with toys in the morning.

Sorry for the wall of text, but finally to the question:

I‚Äôm worried the little one isn‚Äôt being honest with her feelings towards things. I think I‚Äôm creating an environment where she‚Äôs always felt free to speak what‚Äôs on her mind, but I maybe I could do something better? The little one has brought up concerns with my ex in the past when they wouldn‚Äôt talk to them and I made sure to encourage them to talk to one another 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated and sorry again for the long post","My little one is saying separate things to her separated parentsHey folks,

I have a bit of a situation I‚Äôm at a loss for dealing with (on account of not having parents I can talk to)

The little one is 7.5 and has been doing something odd as of late. I‚Äôll start by saying it isn‚Äôt a big deal yet, but I‚Äôd like to start getting things ready before it is

Last Monday, I got a text from my ex saying the little one felt like they weren‚Äôt being heard by me. She also said my daughter mentioned I had called her a name but to the best of my ability, I don‚Äôt remember ever doing so or using that word.

Now I should start by saying prior to this text, everything was good. When I last saw my daughter (4 days ago) she had exclaimed how happy she was and general pleasantries towards my parenting. We‚Äôve even had a weekly tradition of having juice and cookies together and discussing how both of us did as a mom and daughter the week prior and if there‚Äôs something we can improve on.

When I finally spoke to my daughter on the phone,  she was initially reluctant to say anything, but eventually came back with the answer that she just wanted to play more hide and seek. That was it. My ex seems to think it‚Äôs because I sleep in late on account of my work schedule (I‚Äôm usually in bed by 4 am), but I‚Äôve often asked the little one if that‚Äôs ever a problem, and have made sure to sleep on the couch while they play with toys in the morning.

Sorry for the wall of text, but finally to the question:

My nine year olds social problems are worse than I thought,Parenting,132,dbx5mj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dbx5mj/my_nine_year_olds_social_problems_are_worse_than/,60,1569981897.0,"My 9 year old daughter has always been a little different than the other kids. She doesn‚Äôt make friends as easily and she has a hard time keeping the ones she does make. In her own words, she feels like an outcast. For the past few years I‚Äôve been trying to help her build her social skills and confidence by keeping her in after school activities, arranging play dates, etc. I kept thinking that if she just had enough practice and support, she‚Äôd eventually ‚Äúget it‚Äù, and be able to integrate more into her group of peers and form the friendships that she craves.

She became close with a very caring and kind-hearted girl in her class (let‚Äôs call her B) which I was thrilled about. B‚Äôs mom is the leader of her Girl Scout troop, and is also very nice and fair and always did what she could to build my daughter up and encourage her. B has a large group of friends at school, and I thought that her becoming close with my daughter was just the opportunity she needed to come out of her shell and blossom. Things could not have backfired worse.

B has a sleepover birthday party and my daughter was invited. I was thrilled. There were about 10 girls there, all in her class and I thought it would be a great opportunity for her to become closer to some of them. I was out of town for work this weekend so my mom took her to the party and picked her up. I got a FaceTime call Saturday morning from my daughter in tears telling me what a terrible time she had and how everyone had ignored and excluded her. I was heartbroken and I let her vent and tried to build her up and let her know I was in her corner. I texted B‚Äôs mom to find out more, and it soon became apparent that my daughter was a big part of the problem. B‚Äôs mom emphasized how she and some of the other girls at the party tried to make my daughter feel included, but she perceived that she was being ignored and was not welcome, and she spent a good bit of the party crying and complaining. Now I‚Äôm not going to pretend that there are no mean girls in her class, because there are, and cliquishness is definitely rearing it‚Äôs ugly head already. But I trust B‚Äôs mom and I know that the way she described the situation sounds exactly like something my daughter would do.

I am still trying to be supportive of her and make her feel like I am on her side so that I can guide her to make better choices and handle herself better in the future. But last night I talked to her and asked how school went Monday and if she talked to B. She said yes and that she also talked to B‚Äôs mom when she came to pick her up at aftercare. I asked her to tell me how to conversation went and she said that B and her mom were upset that a few of the girls did not have a good time at the party, and my daughter REITERATED that she DID NOT have a good time.

My jaw dropped. Her lack of tact or social graces or just EMPATHY to know that you don‚Äôt further knock a friend down when they‚Äôre already upset... it makes me feel sick. I texted B‚Äôs mom and asked her to apologize to B on my behalf, and I got back a very graceful and very gentle reply which basically confirmed my fear that B is not going to want to continue the friendship. And my daughter still doesn‚Äôt seem to ‚Äúget it‚Äù, that she did anything wrong.

I feel like I‚Äôm in so over my head. I thought she just needed more practice to find her way but I‚Äôm coming to realize that‚Äôs not the case, and I think there is something really wrong with her and she needs help. I‚Äôve got an appointment to talk to her school counselor and I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to get her into professional counseling so we can get to the bottom of this, whether the problem is emotional, behavioral, neurological... I just don‚Äôt know. She has Medicaid so that‚Äôs an added layer of difficulty in getting prompt attention, but I can‚Äôt afford private health insurance or to pay out of pocket right now as I‚Äôm in school. Her dad and I are also not together and he is showing an astonishing lack of concern about her problems. We split time with her 50/50 right now but I think that that is causing her emotional problems and I‚Äôm looking into petitioning for primary custody so that I can give her more stability and support, but that is a whole other can of worms.

A concrete question to end this rant though: should I sit her down and make it clear to her that B does not wish to continue the friendship and her behavior is to blame? Part of me really wants to, because I want it to sink into her head that her behavior towards other people, towards FRIENDS is unacceptable. But if her behavior is stemming from emotional or psychological problems that are outside of her control, i don‚Äôt want to pile onto her and make her feel even worse about herself. Besides I‚Äôm not even convinced that she is able to get it because I‚Äôve always pointed out how her behaviors might push people away but it doesn‚Äôt seem to sink in.","My nine year olds social problems are worse than I thoughtMy 9 year old daughter has always been a little different than the other kids.

How do you keep calm during stressful times?,Parenting,5,dc9pgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dc9pgg/how_do_you_keep_calm_during_stressful_times/,7,1570049188.0,"I grew up with yelling in my house and my mom losing it and my dad screaming at my brother when something happened. My aunt/uncle did the same thing. I see myself doing that and I don't want to. It is stressful and hurtful and I don't want to break my daughter's spirit. She is so sweet and happy most of the time. I don't want to be something/one she has to get healing for because I can't check my temper with her.

She is 4.5. My husband and I are separated but working on things and we spend a couple days/evenings a week together with her there. She just started pre-k, before that she was with a nanny since she was an infant. That nanny has moved back to her home state so before/after school she is with my cousin and her kids. These are all new developments in the past 1-2 months so I know it's so much change for her. 

Tantrums have always been EPIC for her. Like she hurts my ears from screaming. And these started when she was under 2. They had gotten so much better but now any time she is told ""NO"" about anything she resorts to having a complete melt down. No, you can't have 3 M&M's because that is a reward for getting dressed before school and you didn't do it. No, I don't have any juice in the car when we are driving and I'm not stopping to get more. No, you can't sleep in my bed with me, you are a big girl and you have your own bed and I will always come in to comfort you but you need to stay in your bed. No, you can't have fruit snacks for supper, you need to eat your dinner. I do tell her yes sometimes, it's not always no. 

We do breathing exercises to calm down and it often helps but not until she's ready. If she's mid freak-out, trying to get her to take deep breaths is very hard...she will usually get very worked up and then say ""calm me down mama"" and then we will take breaths together and I'll snuggle her. 

But I yell before, during, after. Usually I'm alone and I can't just walk away because she chases me, hangs off my clothing, I can't get 2 minutes to take a breather and regain my composure. I DO NOT WANT TO GET SO STRESSED OUT THAT I'M YELLING. I feel like I'm constantly asking her forgiveness for getting upset. We both apologize to each other.

Her dad doesn't get the behaviors nearly as much as I do, but when he does, he's much better at keeping calm. I am calm until I explode. Last night she screamed the whole way home from work/daycare. We did breathing in the car but she didn't really calm down til we were about home then she was laughing. Bed time wasn't bad but she was awake for 90 minutes in the middle of the night (not common for her) and screaming. I calmed her down over and over but also was losing my shit in between. She finally fell back asleep. This morning it started all over again. Screaming b/c she didn't want to get dressed. I try bribes, praise, anything to get her to cooperate in the morning. She wouldn't and I finally gave up and sent her to daycare in her jammies which is what she WANTS. So she gets her own way and it further reinforces that she can scream to get what she wants. 

Please help. I feel broken.","How do you keep calm during stressful times?I grew up with yelling in my house and my mom losing it and my dad screaming at my brother when something happened.

One reason that I think she lashes out is out of jealousy towards her brother. He‚Äôs very talkative and more willing to show affection. My daughter is a lot more reserved like I am, and I think she gets annoyed sometimes when asked about her day and what not. I remember that feeling too as a kid.

The thing is, I know she feels jealous about it but she doesn‚Äôt want to open up to me right away so it creates this tension in the car where she despises her brother. Then they start trying to talk over each other and it all goes downhill fast.

My 8 year old daughter has a pretty great life... her Dad & I have been happily married her whole life, I've stayed home with her her whole life, we are always doing fun family events, she's enrolled in extracurricular activities, I dress her cute, spend time with her, etc... she has a great foundation!

Problem is, you would never know. She has trouble making friends in school, kids aren't interested in playing with her much, she doesn't seem joyful ever, rarely is she enthusiastic or outgoing, it's like she doesn't have a 'spark' inside, she doesn't see how great she has it.

I volunteer at her school, and when I see her at school, she's always alone, and she kind of keeps her head down and walks slow; it's so hard for me to see other kids laughing and playing and being funny, and mine is very grave and solemn. It's frustrating and depressing. I feel like I pour my everything into her, from the moment I wake up until bedtime, and her lack of optimism and happiness completely drains me every day. I am a pretty outgoing and social person, but I feel like I am totally failing in life, and yet, I can't see what I'm doing wrong. Any advice?

EDIT: I just wanna give a huge thank you to everyone who chimed in, it's helped me tremendously and has changed my way of thinking.

my son messages me only when he wants money.  i dish it out 10  here, 20 there etc.  i am tired of him taking advantage.  he doesn't do much chores, he is always putting himself down, saying he is a loser, no good for nothing.  same stuff i hear from clients who are on the path of healing. he uses thebpityvtrip to make me feel guilty and give in to his wants. if he doesn't get what he wants he starts to self harm by slashing his wrists.

i need some suggestions on what i can do to help him realize there are healthier ways to live.  that he doesn't have to be this victim."

***UPDATE*** 
Went to the appointment for the amniocentesis today. First spoke with a genetic counselor about our results from the 1st scan we had done where the large NT was found. We all agreed that based on those results, an amniocentesis would be best for my situation. 
We then got another ultrasound done to remeasure and look at baby. The doctor then came in and said that all of our scans/measurements looked completely normal and heathy for gestational age and she said she personally doesn‚Äôt see much reason for an Incase test like an amnio right now and suggested the NIPT blood test. 
We took her advice and I will be getting my blood drawn tomorrow and going off of those results. If something if found, I am early enough in my pregnancy to get a amniocentesis is this blood test comes back showing an abnormality.



Original post:
I (23F) and my boyfriend (31M) are expecting out 2nd child together this March/April. I went in last Thursday for my 1st trimester ultrasound and found that his/her NT (nuchal translucency) was measuring large, at 3.3. This along with previous genetic blood work I had done put us at a 1 in 5 chance of this child having some kind of chromosomal abnormality. To say I was shocked is a massive understatement. I felt numb but also the worst pain I had ever felt in my life. My bf was working at the time, and I was alone when receiving this news which made it worse. 
I feel so lost, scared, sad and confused. I‚Äôve been crying multiple times a day since that appointment and it‚Äôs taking me a while to wrap my head around this. 
I‚Äôm scheduled to have a amniocentesis on Tuesday of next week and this will help get some answers. My bf is not quite on board with the amniocentesis and is scared of the risks for both me and baby. Which of course, I am too. But I cannot go the rest of the pregnancy wondering what is happening with my baby. 

Not sure the point of writing this, I guess I‚Äôm just looking for some kind words of encouragement or words of wisdom for anyone who has gone through something similar.","Chromosomal AbnormalityChromosomal Abnormalities

Major daycare issues,Parenting,0,dcdke3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dcdke3/major_daycare_issues/,21,1570066705.0,"My daughter is soon to be 3 (in three months). She has always gotten good reports from school, no issues with violence or problems with not listening. We had a conference with her daycare teachers in the spring and they told us she was on track for her age and they weren't concerned about anything.

About four months ago she moved from the early 2s class to a new class that is for 2.5-3 year olds and suddenly everything is a huge problem! One of her teachers brought up getting her evaluated for speech. She said they can't understand her and when they ask her questions she can't answer them or starts talking about something else. My daughter can be difficult to understand, she mumbles a lot and speaks very quietly, but as far as I know that isn't weird for toddlers. The teacher also has mentioned that my daughter is having problems with poopy diapers. She is in pull ups but she doesn't pee or poop on the potty yet. Her teachers have tried working with her on using the potty but she isn't interested yet, no big deal. The teacher mentioned that my daughter's pull ups can't hold all the poop, and the poop is leaking and getting on her pants and sometimes her shirt too. They are changing her outfits a few times a week. She recommended going back to diapers instead of pull ups but I don't want to do that because I find that to be babying her.

 The teacher seemed more concerned with the fact that my daughter will not tell anyone after she poops. She gently mentioned that my daughter will sit or play in her poopy pull up and doesn't seem bothered by it at all until somebody smells it and it makes it harder to clean her after. She said this is unusual and that a 3 year old should let someone know after they poop or get poop on their clothes. As far as I know, isn't that pretty normal for toddlers?? Isn't that why the teachers are there, to watch my daughter and figure out when she needs a change?

I'm getting worried that these teachers are holding my daughter to standards that aren't age appropriate. I mentioned all her previous good reports and the conference in the spring and all the teacher said was ""Sometimes things aren't an issue at one age but as they get older they become more concerning."" But that conference was only 6 months ago!

So I came by today to observe her at school, I stayed in the classroom and watched at the window when they were outside. The teachers had all the kids on the playground picking up fall leaves and collecting them. My daughter was grabbing grass out of the ground and brought some over to her teacher. The teacher said ""\[Daughter\], picking grass hurts the ground. Go find some leaves."" My daughter again wandered off and picked some grass. She carried handfuls of grass over to the teacher. The teacher said ""We are only picking up leafs, \[daughter name\]. Can you go find a leaf for me."" When my daughter went back to picking handfuls of grass the teacher got frustrated and said ""Stop pulling the grass, that hurts the ground! Go find a leaf, only leafs!"" After that my daughter did find a leaf and brought it. Some of the other kids overheard and were copying the teacher and saying to my daughter ""Don't pick grass! Only pick up a leaf!"" The teacher didn't stop them, I found it so inappropriate to allow other children to gang up like that. 

I think the teachers are holding my daughter to standards that aren't age appropriate and now they're letting other kids yell at my kid. I am uncomfortable. Should I go to the director?? Or should I talk to the teachers? Or pull her?","Major daycare issuesMy daughter is soon to be 3 (in three months).

I have a 10 month old that has been slightly delayed in his gross motor skills, but nothing I thought was of any cause for concern. He was steadily sitting by himself at 7 months and rolling around at 5 months. He‚Äôs always been a happy and content baby with very good head control so I didn‚Äôt see any issues with it. 

He‚Äôs currently not properly crawling. He started commando crawling at about 9 months and is happily getting around this way ever since. He‚Äôs walking with us holding his hands and leaning against furniture, but not pulling himself up (although he does try).

At the review yesterday the health visitor considered all these things a problem and would like a further review in 3 months time. 
She thinks he should be crawling by now, standing against furniture and picking things off the floor while doing it. She was also not happy about the fact that he didn‚Äôt hand a toy over when you ask him. 

He is quite a big boy and always thought that it could be why it took him slightly longer, but now I‚Äôm doubting everything. 

I went into the review happy and confident and have left an anxious mess as the health visitor couldn‚Äôt or chose not to explain the consequences of not meeting these milestones on time. This has caused me to spend the evening googling every possible scenario. 

I would really appreciate any input or knowledge you might have of similar situations.","Delay in gross motor skill at 10 month reviewI think I am looking for some reassurance as this is causing me terrible anxiety.

The door was open. We‚Äôve lived in this house our whole life and he knew I could hear the conversation. 

He and his friends were having a conversation and to summarize a friend complained that he had been on a date with a girl, he payed for her food, and they went somewhere in his car, and they started to have sex but she changed her mind halfway through. 

I heard what at first I thought was a friend my son wouldn‚Äôt be seeing anymore, say ‚Äúnah, you shouldn‚Äôt have stopped.

So I kind of organized my thoughts and I read some articles online and I searched the past for how I went so horribly wrong (I‚Äôm amicably divorced from his mother and have partial custody, on weekends) and I called her to let her know what I heard. She was stunned.

Do you believe any of those things you were saying?‚Äù And he was totally unfazed and said ‚Äúyah, of course.‚Äù 

I was unprepared for that. I was really clinging to the belief that he was just trying to seem cool. So I said I was disgusted to hear him speaking that way when I thought it was just macho bullshit but to know he actually espoused those beliefs left me speechless and I needed a minute. 

Whether it was 30 seconds or 5 minutes I don‚Äôt know but finally I said ‚Äúwhat if someone talked about your mother that way or treated her that way?‚Äù And he said, again paraphrasing, ‚ÄúShe wouldn‚Äôt do something so slutty.‚Äù 

I was out of things to say at that point and just kept repeating the same things I‚Äôd been telling him since he was 12, that he needs to respect women and that consent is not optional.

8 Month Old Still in Love to Dream Swaddle Up,Parenting,0,dcbqxt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dcbqxt/8_month_old_still_in_love_to_dream_swaddle_up/,12,1570058818.0,"My daughter (DD) is turning 8 months old and she still naps and sleeps in her Love to Dream Swaddle Up 50/50 (it's a sleep sack with little zippered ""wings"" so that the baby can sleep with their arms up but restrained and the wings can be removed when they are weaned). I know babies need to be weaned from any kind of swaddle when they start rolling, but DD does not roll or crawl (her size may be a part of it - she's always been in the 99th percentile for height and weight and she's currently 24 pounds and 29 inches). But she's been sitting unassisted since 5 months and can stand while assisted.

So, I'm wondering two things: Is there anything wrong with keeping an infant in the Swaddle Up until they grow out of it if they are not rolling? She's currently in the X-Large, which is for 24-30 pounds. And has anyone else also used the Swaddle Up for an older infant and have tips or stories on transitioning them out?

**CONTEXT:** The wings definitely help her sleep better because she uses them to self-soothe back to sleep - she likes to stretch her arms up (the wings are very flexible since she's in the X-Large) so that the material pulls up under her chin and her wings press against the sides of her head. She likes to turn her head and suck and mouth the wing fabric and rub her face with the wings.

We also put rolled-up towels under her sheets length-wise down the crib sides so there is a wide, shallow dip that keeps her from wriggling sideways. We positioned the top of the towels so that they point slightly to each other, creating a sort of arch under which she places her head and arm wings, which gives a very slight cradling effect. I attribute her Swaddle Up and crib setup with her consistently good sleep and I dread getting rid of of it all! Thanks for any insight!

**EDIT:** Due to comments I‚Äôve received, I need to add some more detail to my post. DD isn‚Äôt, like, frozen in her crib. She‚Äôs in the low weight range for the X-Large Swaddle Up 50/50, so she‚Äôs able to stretch her arms above her head, stretch the wings to her side, and bring the wing tips to her mouth and to each other. Her legs have as much range as in any other sleep sack, so she is able to sleep in different positions on her back. The towels under the sheet (which were implemented when we were doing some light sleep training at 6.5 months) are low and against the crib bars and the crib is wide enough so they don‚Äôt touch her body - they just keep her from bumping her head and feet against the bars if she starts shuffling diagonal. If she wanted to roll over, she definitely has the room and strength to do so and the sleep sack isn't much of a barrier, but she really doesn‚Äôt. She hates being on her belly.

Most comments say that we‚Äôre inhibiting her physical development, but what if she‚Äôs actually *sleeping*? We don‚Äôt allow her to play in the crib - the crib is for sleeping and we monitor her on a phone app. She's vocal when she's awake, so if she doesn't settle within 5-10 minutes, we either take her out of the sack and bring her outside with us to play or rock her until drowsy again. Her crib is in the corner of our bedroom, so we do the same thing in the middle of the night, but fortunately, she re-settles or sleeps through 99% of the time. So, she naps for 2-3 hours during the day and 10-11 hours at night, usually re-settles within a few minutes when she wakes in the middle of it, and then we have a well-rested, happy, alert, and engaged baby during her awake time.

All the ""official"" recommendations about the swaddle that I've found always stipulate that babies should be weaned when they roll, but nothing about if they don't roll. The Precious Little Sleep website even says ""Older babies may or may not need to be swaddled. Most are done by 3 months but don‚Äôt worry if your 6 or 9 month old still needs to be swaddled. There is no rush!"" I am posting here because of the few resources that I've found about this specific swaddle question and wondering if someone else knows of a reason or recommendation from an ""official"" source. And, I hope to help out other parents who are in the same situation, because I don't want to ruin her sleep just because I feel pressured to.","8 Month Old Still in Love to Dream Swaddle UpMy daughter (DD) is turning 8 months old and she still naps and sleeps in her Love to Dream Swaddle Up 50/50 (it's a sleep sack with little zippered ""wings"" so that the baby can sleep with their arms up but restrained and the wings can be removed when they are weaned). I know babies need to be weaned from any kind of swaddle when they start rolling, but DD does not roll or crawl (her size may be a part of it - she's always been in the 99th percentile for height and weight and she's currently 24 pounds and 29 inches). But she's been sitting unassisted since 5 months and can stand while assisted.

So, I'm wondering two things: Is there anything wrong with keeping an infant in the Swaddle Up until they grow out of it if they are not rolling? She's currently in the X-Large, which is for 24-30 pounds. And has anyone else also used the Swaddle Up for an older infant and have tips or stories on transitioning them out?

**CONTEXT:** The wings definitely help her sleep better because she uses them to self-soothe back to sleep - she likes to stretch her arms up (the wings are very flexible since she's in the X-Large) so that the material pulls up under her chin and her wings press against the sides of her head. She likes to turn her head and suck and mouth the wing fabric and rub her face with the wings.

How do I set an example of being respectful and patient when they get ANGRY and offended during conversations that have nothing to do with them?  (Example: we were talking about how this other kid in class was throwing an eraser around in class and my son said ""because he thinks he's smarter than everyone else."" I added ""yeah he probably also--"" Then my son got MAD and cut me off insisting he (my son) was right.  I told him after calming down myself that I wasn't disagreeing with him.  What I was going to say before I got cut off was that this kid probably valued the fun of throwing the eraser over learning BECAUSE he thought he was smarter than everyone else.)  Like, what the hell?  Why do you get so offended over nothing?  I was agreeing with you.

It's wearing me down.  Kids can be really huge pricks sometimes.  Silver lining is I keep imagining how close me and my boys will be when they're in their 20s and 30s and they have all their emotional shit together.  Probably focused primarily on crippling student loan debt like me.

I'm never going to stop loving my boys and letting them know I will always be here to give them unsolicited dad advice, but how do you do it while retaining your sanity when they act nasty and ungrateful in return?  How do you not let your anger flare up when they act so disrespectfully and inappropriately to the situation?  I try calmly telling my pre-teen that he's not being nice and that our conversation would go better if he kept an eye on his emotional responses and whether they're appropriate.  But he just keeps pushing my buttons and I don't have infinite patience, so I try to explain why his actions are fucked up and it ends up a long dad lecture that both of us are getting sick of at this point.

&#x200B;

My wife suggested starting today we should stop trying to explain why his behavior is wrong and leaving it at ""Please don't talk to me like that"" and if he continues we say ""Alright, we can resume this conversation when you have your feelings and behavior more under control"" and wait.

This sounds okay in theory, but my son has already complained to me about how he feels lonely a lot and wishes he could play with us more.  I worry if we do this he's going to use it as an excuse to lash out even more.   Can't get him to understand that we both work full-time, there's an almost 2 year old baby brother in the picture, and we take the pre-teen to sports three times a week, play beyblades, watch movies, read books, and talk about his day and his feelings all the time.  Give me a break there's only so many hours in the day and the entire family is already doing as much as we can to keep his shitty attitude at bay and sometimes it's just exhausting...

Maybe I should've posted this in /rant.

Edit:  THANK YOU to everyone who took the time to help me out on this one.  I'm writing this quote from u/flat_possum down and making it my default response if the rudeness and disrespect doesn't end: ""You're speaking rudely and hurtfully. I'd love to spend more time with you, but only when you're being respectful and kind. Let me know when you're ready to do that.""","Parents who survived pre-teens and teens... how? Help.How do I keep my calm when they talk back?  How do I set an example of being respectful and patient when they get ANGRY and offended during conversations that have nothing to do with them?  (Example: we were talking about how this other kid in class was throwing an eraser around in class and my son said ""because he thinks he's smarter than everyone else."" I added ""yeah he probably also--"" Then my son got MAD and cut me off insisting he (my son) was right.  I told him after calming down myself that I wasn't disagreeing with him.  What I was going to say before I got cut off was that this kid probably valued the fun of throwing the eraser over learning BECAUSE he thought he was smarter than everyone else.)  Like, what the hell?  Why do you get so offended over nothing?  I was agreeing with you.

It's wearing me down.  Kids can be really huge pricks sometimes.  Silver lining is I keep imagining how close me and my boys will be when they're in their 20s and 30s and they have all their emotional shit together.  Probably focused primarily on crippling student loan debt like me.

I'm never going to stop loving my boys and letting them know I will always be here to give them unsolicited dad advice, but how do you do it while retaining your sanity when they act nasty and ungrateful in return?  How do you not let your anger flare up when they act so disrespectfully and inappropriately to the situation?  I try calmly telling my pre-teen that he's not being nice and that our conversation would go better if he kept an eye on his emotional responses and whether they're appropriate.  But he just keeps pushing my buttons and I don't have infinite patience, so I try to explain why his actions are fucked up and it ends up a long dad lecture that both of us are getting sick of at this point.

&#x200B;

My wife suggested starting today we should stop trying to explain why his behavior is wrong and leaving it at ""Please don't talk to me like that"" and if he continues we say ""Alright, we can resume this conversation when you have your feelings and behavior more under control"" and wait.

This sounds okay in theory, but my son has already complained to me about how he feels lonely a lot and wishes he could play with us more.  I worry if we do this he's going to use it as an excuse to lash out even more.   Can't get him to understand that we both work full-time, there's an almost 2 year old baby brother in the picture, and we take the pre-teen to sports three times a week, play beyblades, watch movies, read books, and talk about his day and his feelings all the time.  Give me a break there's only so many hours in the day and the entire family is already doing as much as we can to keep his shitty attitude at bay and sometimes it's just exhausting...

Maybe I should've posted this in /rant.

I have come to believe that my eldest son(16M) is being targeted by anti-Semitic hate in school.,Parenting,25,dbtnwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dbtnwq/i_have_come_to_believe_that_my_eldest_son16m_is/,34,1569966582.0,"So, the whole story started last Friday when my son and his girlfriend(also Jewish) walked into our home after school at around 5pm. My son had a black fucking eye. Immediately after seeing that, I asked him why his eye is black. He told me that he accidentally hit his eye while quickly going to itch his head. His girlfriend was looking down at the ground, and she looked super guilty, as if he told her not to tell me what happened. I knew that was complete BS. But, he got a little aggressive when I said that story doesn‚Äôt add up. But, I let it pass. The weekend was normal. His girlfriend came over with her family and we all celebrated rosh hashanah together. Fast forward to yesterday, about 30 minutes before we leave to go to school, he told his mom, my wife, that he was ‚Äúsick‚Äù. My wife has mommy super powers, and didn‚Äôt give in. She asked him why he was trying to skip school, and he admitted to not being sick and said he was really tired and didn‚Äôt do homework last night. He does great in school, is a good boy at home, and hasn‚Äôt skipped school in years, so, we said sure. I actually didn‚Äôt know how to call in a sick day, so that was a learning experience. 

Alright, so here is when stuff started making sense to me. When I came home with our two twin other kids form elementary school, while walking past his room to the bathroom, I heard him crying. I have literally never heard him cry since he was really little. At this point, I really couldn‚Äôt just ignore it anymore. So, I knocked on his door and opened it up seeing him and his girlfriend hugging while he is literally balling his eyes out. His girlfriend immediately told me that he‚Äôs being picked on in one of his classes. After talking for around 10 minutes with both of them, he agreed to talk to the school about it, and insisted that I stay out of it and let him handle it. I shrugged and agreed. I told him and his girlfriend that if they ignore it, it‚Äôs all going to get worse. And that I want to help both of them. His girlfriend promised me that if he doesn‚Äôt, she will. Well, now it‚Äôs today. I walked into my sons room to pick up his dirty laundry for him because I had time, and realized he left his Star of David necklace at home today, he wears it everywhere since his Oma(grandmother) gave it to him when he was 9. 

Honestly, I don‚Äôt trust that my son will own up to being targeted and tell the school. I don‚Äôt know what my actions should be when he comes home, how do I prove that he‚Äôs talked to the school while still respecting ‚Äúnot getting involved‚Äù. This hurts me so much to see my own son getting picked on. Although he hides it, he‚Äôs a sweet little guy and isn‚Äôt that tough. My wife wants to call immediately. I don‚Äôt know what I want to do. We decided to wait until after school. Any advice would be welcomed.

I am so damn tired. No, I don't have four children or anything. No, I don't work full time. No, I don't have to be the single parent either. I have everything: a shelter, money, my partner, my kid, a job; but I am absolutely tired. I don't even know why I exist. I just want to curl up and I don't know, stay like that for forever? 

I had a weird day today. It started out just fine. I gave my daughter breakfast. We hanged out. I took her to open preschool where parents can participate. I watched her play with other children and interacted with other parents as well. Then we went to look at Christmas decorations (I know that it's not even Halloween yet.) And then we went to secondhand shop. Then we came home. All this took from 7:00-14:30. From 14:30, I started cooking. 

That's when it got too much for me. I had to cook and took care of her as well. We live in a big apartment where kitchen is a kitchen and living room is a living room - I cannot see what she is up to half the time but I always check on her except when I have to stove on then I need to turn that off before I check on her. I don't want her to suddenly come around the corner and start touching the stove. Nope. 

Anyway, I got annoyed. I started to get cranky. My kid wouldn't stop mumbling and I felt horrible for feeling annoyed because I just wanted to cook and get it done nicely plus tasty but I couldn't concentrate. She asked to watch me and I don't like being watched. She asked to play with dirty dishes in the sink (pretending to clean them) so I agreed to it because it's better than having her standing next to me near the stove and it meant I would have my eyes on her. 

Then my partner came home. It was like a salvage moment. I asked him to take her away a little bit so I could finish up dinner. Turned out, she had her toys all over and flour on the table, on the couch, on the TV, etc. You know, those untrustworthy silent moments from toddlers? It was one of those moments. 

My partner got upset that I did not watch our kid properly. I was cooking. I got upset too because here I was; trying to finish the food and having to help her clean up. He got upset that the food wasn't done in time and that the apartment looked like no one respects the rules. He pretty much said I let her roam free without giving her the attention so I might as well dump her in preschool. 

I broke down pretty much. I am tired. I am 3 months pregnant and having to take care a 3 years old most days by myself while he is at work. Does he help? Yes. He does help but he also expects everything to be perfectly immaculate when he comes home. Is that impossible? I don't know, maybe it is not and maybe I am just a horrible human being who cannot pull it together. 

I feel like that actually, that I cannot pull it together. 

So we discussed all of these things and we came to a conclusion: I do too much, I do too many things at once when it is not necessary at all. He has it nice with her only because he is at work most days and when he has his days off, he has it simple: cooking and being with her. What about the days he works? Well, I do laundry, cooking, cleaning, working when I am booked into work, and ultimately, taking care of a 3 year old. 

I don't know. I am just a mess at this point. Am I a spoiled brat who cannot be content with things? I feel like that but at the same time, my problem / my issue is in my head: I overdo things and I want to simplify things more. I want to have the energy and be happy around my family, not having my head up in the clouds somewhere. Imagine a traffic in India then you'd know what my head is like ALL THE FREAKING TIME.

It has been a rough ride for sleep since the beginning of trying to transition her to her own room/bed (~6 months ago) and, I‚Äôll admit, mostly fault of my own (taking her from her room to get that extra hour of sleep for myself) for why the sleeping issues have continued. We have her on a semi-strict routine, generally, hands-on/outside playtime (park/walk/drawing/reading/etc.) scattered before dinner, dinner @ 6:00-7:00pm, bath @ 7:30pm, a melatonin gummy shortly thereafter (recommended by her pediatrician) and then out sometime on her own from 8:00-8:45. The issue isn‚Äôt getting her to sleep, or getting her in her bed- it is keeping her in the room. She used to just cry, and her pediatrician recommended letting her sleep train at intervals of time- and we finally got it to work about 3 months ago. She would sleep through the night until sometime between 6:00-7:30am the next morning. After about two weeks of that, she got the flu and has been unable to sleep in her bed since. I don‚Äôt know if this is related, but she naps once a day, between 11:30-12:30, for roughly an hour- but then wakes up just as tired as when she went down but won‚Äôt lay back in her bed. Recently, getting her to stay in the room has evolved from crying to trashing her room (taking out every toy imaginable, ripping off her bed sheets, pulling down her curtains, pulling clothes out of her drawers, etc.) while hysterically crying until either I or her mother gets her from the room. We‚Äôve tried night lights, white noise/small fans, laying next to her while she‚Äôs in her bed. Once she awakes, generally around 2 1/2 hours after being laid down, it is utter chaos and refusal to sleep. She spends one day a week at her grandmother‚Äôs and sleeps there ‚Äúlike an angel‚Äù by herself on my childhood bed for up to two hours- with my grandmother sitting idly in a rocking chair next to her. Again, I fully acknowledge that most of her sleeping problems come from me not disciplining myself enough to just let her cry, but it has reached a point where it has to stop- for her own good and my mental sanity. Her younger sister, who just turned one, is a perfectly fine sleeper. Wakes up once, maybe twice throughout the night for some whole milk and plops right back to sleep.

I had to miss my support group last night because my husband was working late. I cut my finger twice in two days. I burned dinner. The dishwasher's giving me trouble and not cleaning dishes properly. My youngest had a pooptastrophie in the bathroom. As I was unclogging the toilet and sanitizing the floor and toilet, my youngest yelled out some details about his video game that I couldn't hear because he talks softly and I just didn't want to be discussing video games while I was unclogging the toilet and battling my feelings of disgust about the poop mess.

They're getting better and will be able to go back to school tomorrow. It won't be a minute too soon for me. It's just a lot right now. Writing it out makes me feel a bit better. 

I love them and I'll miss how cute they are when young and I'm sure teenage years will be crazy, but I would also very much like my kids to be able to do things (read ""clean up poop"") for themselves and be their own babysitters.

Being constantly guilt tripped for having a job,Parenting,15,dbtspt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dbtspt/being_constantly_guilt_tripped_for_having_a_job/,16,1569967221.0,"**Background**

* ExH and I have twins, who are three. They attend nursery at a school, and are there for the full school day (9am-3pm ish).
* ExH and I split up in June, but for a multitude of reasons we still live together. A quick scan of my post history shows this isn't the best environments, but we're pretty much stuck in it until our house is sold (currently on the market)
* I started my job in May 2018, working evenings and weekends from home. My hours changed in April this year, to more typical ""business hours"", and started working in our office (3 miles away) more often. I got promoted in June, with these hours and work set-up remaining.
* ExH works a part time contract in the evening, and takes on overnight overtime when he can. Sometimes this is short notice, and the frequency of this alters from week to week.

I have an element of flexibility in my work, as long as I don't take advantage of it. I am able to work 1 day a week from home, although I only use this when I need to, as my promotion has come with an increased workload that I can handle better in an office setting. There's only one day when my hours are 100% set in stone due to work commitments, which is a Monday. This has been the case since April. Because of the flexibility, and the fact I've worked from home, ExH and his family don't take my job too seriously, even though I make better money than he does, and I have a lot of responsibility in my line of work (no MLMs here, guys!)

The kids started at school this September.  With my flexibility I have agreed with ExH to drop them off at school Tuesday - Friday, but he would be responsible for Monday drop off/pick up, and pick ups Tuesday - Friday (NB: Any hours outside of my regular business hours that I do not work, I have to make up in my own time, as you can expect) . I proposed this to him as a way for him to still get a decent amount of sleep when he works overtime (he gets home about 5am, kids get out of school just after 3pm), and it's still split as evenly as it can be.

ExH goes along with this, but constantly makes comments about how I am a bad parent for ""prioritising my work over the children"", which is far from the truth. I would pick them up and take them to school every single day if I could, but my working hours, which have been in place long before the kids started school, need to be worked to provide for the family.

I've mentioned that with him being at home in the day he has the ability to catch up on his sleep (not perfect, I know, but he has never had issues sleeping in the day since doing this job), but he continually turns it into an argument about how I am not doing enough, and my work should be more flexible (I've yet to find another company as flexible as mine, yet flexibility is about give and take, and I can't just take, take, take.) I don't see it as that unreasonable that the kids get picked up by their dad, and dropped off most of the time by their mum. As long as they're being cared for does it really matter who does it?

As a side note, I have often come home from work, or even from picking the kids up from school when I've been able to, and ExH, by his own admission, has been awake for 3 or 4 hours and has just been sitting watching TV the whole time, and the house is a complete mess. If I dare to not do any housework after the kids go to bed, he will absolutely let me know I'm a terrible person. I'm sick of the double standards.

So, my question is, how do I make him see that as much as I adore my children and would love to do all of the school runs, I have to keep my work happy in order to keep my job, which in turn keeps money coming in, without him calling me a bad mother? I'm at my wits' end with everything, and these constant guilt trips are making it really difficult for me to keep my head down and get on with what I need to do.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I'd just like to add a recent example of how unreasonable some of these outbursts are. On Sunday I offered to go to the shop and buy some bread, as we had ran out. ExH said no, as he was going shopping the following day. On Monday morning he says he is making eggs and toast for the kids, then five minutes later realises we have no bread, and gets in my face shouting at me because I ""should have remembered and told him we had no bread"".","Being constantly guilt tripped for having a job**Background**

He struggles with sharing, yelling at others, being mean . . . essentially being a bully . . . despite any kind of consequence, discussion, anything really. Other children do not like to, or want to, play with him because of his behavior. It also disrupts his classroom.

He also struggles to control his anger.  While he does not destroy things or hurt others, he'll yell and uncontrollably shake.

He also struggles to calm himself down in moments of excitement, rapidly talking and yelling, moving about quickly.  He also regularly talks to himself (not during play).

He is often a terrible listener, doing what he pleases, regardless of consequences (everything from losing privileges and toys to discussion, and yes (I don't want to argue) as a last resort spanking).

Nothing seems to work.  We've been trying to get a handle on this for years.  He's tried behaviour therapy (play therapy) in the past, which really did nothing.

Looking for opinions/advice on possible abusive/inappropriate behavior on the bus.,Parenting,5,dbygdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dbygdb/looking_for_opinionsadvice_on_possible/,10,1569987110.0,"(Sorry, I accidentally deleted this the first time I posted it.)

My daughter just turned four in July and this is her first year getting to ride the bus home. (I still drop her off of the morning.) With the little kids' buses, they have a driver and then someone else on the bus that, I guess, is there to assist with managing unruly pre-k kids.

The bus driver is a woman, but the helper on the bus is an older man, probably in his 70s, and he's kind of creeping me out. I can't *prove* that he's doing anything wrong, and maybe he's not, but I figured I would ask you all what you thought.

First time I felt kind of bothered by him was when the bus stopped and he was standing over my daughter's seat. Before then, he was always in the seat across from her, so I wasn't sure why he would need to be standing, let alone hovering over her seat. 

That eventually escalated to now he's always sitting next to her when she gets off the bus. She sits by the window and he sits next to her, so she's essentially ""trapped"" between him and the side of the bus. It's important to note here that she is the last kid off, so literally the entire bus is available for him to sit, so why is he in her seat?

Then there are the little things he's said/done that have really rubbed me the wrong way. 

A few days ago, he basically told her she had to smile to get off the bus. He was sitting next to her and said, ""You need to smile. Come on, smile."" When she finally gave him a fake smile, he got out of the seat so she could get off.

Yesterday, while sitting next to her again, I heard her telling him to stop doing something. I don't know what he was doing because my view is blocked by that guard between the seats and the door. Anyway, as she's telling him to stop, more than once, he's mocking her. Saying, ""Stop it,"" in a mocking tone. That *really* got on my nerves because I don't care if you're playing around or not, my daughter was not and her space and feelings should be respected.

We've asked her before if he does things to her or says things he shouldn't. Sometimes, she says he's never touched her or never been mean and she likes him. Other times, she says she doesn't like him. The only way I can rationalize that is that, since she's only four, her opinion changes based on the day and what he has or hasn't done that day. Plus, it's always hard to get answers out of her about school/the bus, anyway, because she's always said, ""I don't want to talk about it."" 

Our Parents as Teachers woman said that it's normal for little kids to do that because they consider it their private time. Which, I understand, but it's not helping us get to the bottom of this. We pretty much only get information from her when she feels like talking about it or randomly brings it up in passing.

My wife has also said our daughter told her the guy said she should come to his house sometime. 

At any rate, I brought this up to the school's social worker and she is going to try to talk to our daughter tomorrow sometime and see if she can find anything out.

Am I over-reacting? What would you have done in this situation? I have no proof that anything is wrong, but I've got that whole, ""Parent's intuition,"" thing going on. My gut says someone needs to talk about something with someone.

Edited to fix a few typos here and there.

Thanks a lot, everyone. It feels good to know I'm not the only one who would have reacted this way.

My daughter's response to her father and I separating seems to be that she's gotten more mature?,Parenting,3,dbzh4q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dbzh4q/my_daughters_response_to_her_father_and_i/,8,1569991287.0,"I asked my husband for a divorce 2.5 months ago. So far, we're still just separated, but the relationship is over. We told the kids 1.5 months ago, and one month ago we started ""bird-nesting,"" which means that he and I take turns staying in the house with the kids, rather than having them move back and forth between us. It's been a relatively peaceful process, at least as far as the kids know. I was so worried that the kids would be upset and traumatized. I know my daughter (9) was sad, but she seems to have accepted the situation and adapted pretty quickly.

What I'm shocked by is, I am seeing a degree of maturity in her that I've been waiting to see for a long time now. She's stopped freaking out when she's told to stop playing a video game, or in general when she is told to do things she doesn't want to do. Instead of a lot of whining and crying, I usually just get an ""mhm"" or ""okay"" when I tell her to clear her plate or get her pajamas on, etc. Another thing I'd kind of been waiting to see develop was empathy; in the past, when others were suffering, her response was often to try to redirect the attention to herself and her own needs. Pretty normal stuff for young kids, but now I am actually seeing some degree of empathy and concern for others that I hadn't seen before.  I hope these changes I'm seeing in her aren't actually red flags or something, but we are quite close, and I talk with her about how she is doing, and based on that as well as my observations, she seems to be as happy as ever, if not more.

Son's father met him for the first time...,Parenting,1,dc511o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dc511o/sons_father_met_him_for_the_first_time/,1,1570017374.0,"Sorry in advance for the novel, but I'm also trying to work out my thoughts.  


It's a whirlwind of a situation. Some background: In January 2018 I \[23\] was attending college in Europe and met the man \[29\] who I would eventually end up sharing a child with. Our relationship was great in every sense, though we never officially put a label on anything. I returned to the U.S. in August 2018 and discovered that I was pregnant a few weeks after. Neither of us wanted to be parents at that point, and especially didn't want to bring a child into a situation where the parents were not together, but ultimately I couldn't go through with having an abortion.  


We didn't speak much during the pregnancy and when we did were at each other's throats. We said a lot of nasty things to each other that weren't relevant to the child. He remained non-committal and on the fence about being a father and I was persistent that he needed to figure out what sort of role he would play in this child's life. I told him if he didn't have to be a father then he didn't have to be, but he would have to commit to whatever decision he made. He said he didn't want to be a father, but didn't want the baby to not have a father. He said he wanted to see how it could go, but that being a full-on father was never on the table. I believe I posted on here in more detail during my pregnancy, if anyone would like some more background information.  


He began to reach out more towards my due date, asking if our son had been born yet. He was born at the end of April and I texted him thirty minutes later to let him know. I adjusted to parenthood by myself and we continued to quarrel. I sent him updates and pictures, but I don't know if they did much for him. He said he would come meet the baby in July. I wanted him to Skype the baby to have some sort of real time interaction. He didn't until mid-June - was always busy with work or traveling. At this time, he said he probably wouldn't make it to visit in July. I was heartbroken and angry but remained in touch.  


I tried my hardest to keep the peace so he would come meet the baby. In July he booked a ticket for September to come for 5 days. Our relationship improved a lot during that time and it became a lot easier for us to talk to each other again. We continued to Skype a bit here and there and he seemed to start to develop a connection with the baby. He interacted nicely with him during these calls and that made me feel confident about inviting him into our son's life.  


A few days before he arrived he messaged me asking how I felt about him coming so soon, and said that he was excited and terrified at the same time. I assume he had been drinking, since that is really the only time he is able to open up about anything. He asked me how he thought the baby would react and if he would be able to sense any familiarity, and I said I didn't know because he's an infant, but that he is really social and chill so I thought he would do fine. He said he was worried the baby would feel no connection at all and that things would be awkward. We also decided earlier on that he would just stay with us as I live in a very expensive area and he was nervous about that as well, as ""despite all the insults we've thrown at each other we probably won't stop being attracted to each other,"" so he didn't know what we would feel like and what we should feel like. He said he found the entire situation immensely confusing. I said the most important thing was that he meets our son and our son meets him and things don't get messy. Anything else could be worked out later.  


He actually showed up which was nice, because I admittedly didn't truly believe he was here until I saw him. There was no holdup in him completely falling in love with our son. I asked him how he felt after I put the baby down to sleep that first night, what his first impression was, and he says what everyone always says: ""he's great, he's hard not to love."" He seemed to fall into his ""role"" easily. He brought him a toy, a stuffed puffin. I told him the baby's ""favorite"" TV show was a cartoon about puffins and he seemed very pleased with himself. He wanted to hold him a lot, though it was obvious he had never held a baby before meeting ours. He became more natural after not too long. He wanted to push the stroller everywhere. He gave hugs and kisses and flew the baby around in the air and spoke to him in his native language. He woke up early with the baby and would turn on the puffin show and attempt to make his bottles, though I would always have to get up and step in. We went to museums, gardens, beaches; he would often just carry the baby instead of strolling. They seemed like they both enjoyed their time together and I enjoyed watching them interact. For the first time in a long time I felt optimistic about the situation. For awhile I dreaded that he was the father of my baby as he's a party animal and a womanizer and a bachelor - all things that point to being non-committal. But this felt nice and it felt normal and I am seeing him in a different light and taking him more seriously.  


The last day, yesterday, was sad for both of us. He asked me to let him know about my plans to move to the country he is in (I hold dual citizenship and always planned to move there - I still would very much like to, but of course moving to an entirely different continent is a thousand times scarier with a baby and I am hesitant. Still, I booked a flight awhile ago to go in January and see how it would go and how I would feel and maybe begin to apply to graduate schools, but no concrete decision yet). He mentioned casually, without any direct context to the baby, that he always thought it would be nice to live in the U.S. for some time, too. He said he felt more connected now, more like a father, but that he knew he was going to miss out on a lot. He spent a long time saying goodbye to the baby and obviously didn't want to leave him. He said he could keep having Skype calls and he would visit again in the spring. He is home now, and has been texting to ask about the baby and to rant about his shitty job. Reality is setting back in.  


So, parents, I guess I'm not sure where to go from here. It devastates me to be thousands of miles from my child's father and know what they are both missing out on. The visit helped me feel more certain of what I want for my son, which is someone who is there and wants to be there and have him as a significant part of their life and doesn't have a separate life to get back to somewhere else. Maybe that someone isn't his biological father. Of course I want it to be him, but I'm not sure if we are on the same page regarding that. More often than not we have differing views on everything.  


I feel a need to reassess with him and see where he is at and where things could possibly lead, but I don't know if I am jumping the gun and should just stay quiet. I want to ask him now, after having met our son and spent time with him, what he thinks of the possibility of being a full-time father and what role he wants to have. Would he be interested in ever moving here to be a regular part of his son's life? Would he ever want us to move there? Does he just want to continue things as they've been with the occasional Skype call and visiting once a year? My friends and family all want to know how it is going to be and I do, too, but then there is my mother who says I can't ask him to make a big life change like that and that my son will be fine growing up seeing his father once a year (though part of me thinks she just feels threatened that things could change). I feel like these are all reasonable questions to ask, but I don't want to overwhelm him and scare him off, and I don't know how to broach the subject. Is it too soon? Should I try to have the conversation at all or just take the backseat on this ride?  


Thanks for the advice,  
""Mom""","Son's father met him for the first time...Sorry in advance for the novel, but I'm also trying to work out my thoughts.  


It's a whirlwind of a situation. Some background: In January 2018 I \[23\] was attending college in Europe and met the man \[29\] who I would eventually end up sharing a child with. Our relationship was great in every sense, though we never officially put a label on anything. I returned to the U.S. in August 2018 and discovered that I was pregnant a few weeks after. Neither of us wanted to be parents at that point, and especially didn't want to bring a child into a situation where the parents were not together, but ultimately I couldn't go through with having an abortion.  


We didn't speak much during the pregnancy and when we did were at each other's throats. We said a lot of nasty things to each other that weren't relevant to the child. He remained non-committal and on the fence about being a father and I was persistent that he needed to figure out what sort of role he would play in this child's life. I told him if he didn't have to be a father then he didn't have to be, but he would have to commit to whatever decision he made. He said he didn't want to be a father, but didn't want the baby to not have a father. He said he wanted to see how it could go, but that being a full-on father was never on the table. I believe I posted on here in more detail during my pregnancy, if anyone would like some more background information.  


He began to reach out more towards my due date, asking if our son had been born yet. He was born at the end of April and I texted him thirty minutes later to let him know. I adjusted to parenthood by myself and we continued to quarrel. I sent him updates and pictures, but I don't know if they did much for him. He said he would come meet the baby in July. I wanted him to Skype the baby to have some sort of real time interaction. He didn't until mid-June - was always busy with work or traveling. At this time, he said he probably wouldn't make it to visit in July. I was heartbroken and angry but remained in touch.  


I tried my hardest to keep the peace so he would come meet the baby. In July he booked a ticket for September to come for 5 days. Our relationship improved a lot during that time and it became a lot easier for us to talk to each other again. We continued to Skype a bit here and there and he seemed to start to develop a connection with the baby. He interacted nicely with him during these calls and that made me feel confident about inviting him into our son's life.

Right now I'm in a deep pit of ""I want to quit,"" ""I hate myself,"" and "" I don't know what tf I'm doing.""

I have two boys, 3.5 and 5, both wildly awesome and fun, cute kids.

I have gotten to a point with my younger one where I cannot tolerate his behavior lately. I am so angry most of the time. It's mostly sadness that things feel so out of control and that I seem to suck at this. This is my problem, not his 3.5 year old self's problem.

Food conflict hours of the day, screaming at the fridge, refusing to eat or drink anything but milk or cheese or juice. Probably pretty standard toddler life, but it's compounded so much that I could snap.

Car seat battles. ""Just do it yourself!"" they say, while his strong solid self literally cannot let that happen without screaming the neighborhood down and risking pinched fingers or hurt arms.

Bedtime is at least an hour of getting up over and over and over and over and losing desperately needed sleep because he does not nap.

Yesterday he ran into the apartment complex parking lot laughing and somehow did not get hurt. He has never bolted from me before (idk how) but chose to do so that day. I am still shaken from that. And angry.

My kindergartener is doing well and thriving, and I feel guilty that I am so wrapped up in and bled dry from what's happening with brother that I am not giving him what he needs. I'm trying to maintain a newly mended marriage that was going down the toilet for a bit. He works 12ish hours a day and thank GOD stopped his weekend shifts. 

I'm trying to do decently in my classes, finishing prereqs for Nursing. Right now I have no idea how I will make it into or through Nursing school when I start. I am terribly hard on myself with school, the occasional C on an assignment or low test score is a blow to my entire being. Not healthy. The ADN program won't be until little is in kinder himself, but I am shocked at how difficult just two classes is proving right now. And I've done 3 semesters so far to prepare for the program.

I want to quit. I want to quit school/take a break for a while, I am so tired of stretching myself across these things. Maybe I would still be doing a terrible job not losing my temper with my child without classes, I don't know.

Tonight I want to skip class and just escape for a few hours. Not productive, but man, I would love to just hide.

I just need to feel like I'm not a shit bag monster. I feel so angry towards my TINY CHILD whom I adore, and equally racked with guilt for the anger.

Speech therapy - so now what?,Parenting,1,dc4dzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dc4dzz/speech_therapy_so_now_what/,11,1570013849.0,"Ahhh!! First off, I‚Äôm super super grateful things are going on my daughters favor. 

She‚Äôs 5, just started KG. She (FINALLY) got a speech evaluation on 9/11. Through private means, we had her evaluated. And after many bothers to her doc. 

Evaluation went as expected. Her score is less than 1% tile. 

I had meeting with the school on Monday, which went amazingly well. I was expecting to have to fight with them to get her in, but they pretty much said ‚Äúyou did my job for me, I‚Äôm pretty sure she‚Äôs going to qualify. Since the results are so poor, we can skip some steps.‚Äù Teacher was agreeable and on board. 

I have terrible recollection when I‚Äôm hearing things, but the school therapist said my daughter should be expected to start in school therapy before the November break. (I imagine that‚Äôs around thanksgiving). It usually takes longer but since we can skip a few steps we should expect things to happen sooner. 

We are currently approved for 15 sessions of private therapy through insurance (huge YAY!) and we start that tomorrow.

She is diagnosed with a phonological processing disorder, so I‚Äôm glad to be aware of it now. As I can keep an eye on future issues that usually occur with this disorder. 

However, anyone want to give any advice on the speedy 5 minute method? This is what the school is going to attempt to do with her. I read some stuff on it but not much. 

Private therapy is 1 hour sessions. I‚Äôm hoping to learn a lot there so I can continue with it at home. 

But I‚Äôd love any advice so I can keep my kiddo up with her peers. I‚Äôve already heard comments at the playground about ‚Äúwhat language she speaks‚Äù and stuff of that nature from other kids to her ... so far it‚Äôs not bothering her (since I‚Äôm very positive with my daughter about her speech). 

I‚Äôd just love to know what I can do besides just encourage her that she IS speaking English and there‚Äôs just miscommunication (her teacher said she just tells my kid that she‚Äôs hard of hearing and can my child just repeat what she said?), and I don‚Äôt want to discourage my child with this and make her get frustrated getting her point across.

How do you explain to a 2.5 yrs old that her grandfather passed away?,Parenting,9,dbtfec,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dbtfec/how_do_you_explain_to_a_25_yrs_old_that_her/,9,1569965453.0,"Some context: My mom and dad live with us (my wife, daughter and me). My 2.5 yrs old daughter was very close to my dad. Dad passed away 3 days ago. He had been battling cancer for sometime now and that resulted in him being in and out of hospital frequently. My daughter was used to him being away in the hospital for a few days. But she would always want to see his photo, talk over phone or video chat with him while he was away. Closure is very important for her and before taking dad to the hospital we had to always prepare her mentally that her grandfather will be in the hospital for a few days (we did not have any emergencies till now). Unfortunately, when I took dad to the ICU this time, it was in the middle of the night and she had gone to sleep after waving him goodnight. But when she woke up, her grandfather wasn't there. She was not prepared. We told her that he's in the hospital again. She didn't like it and didn't receive it well; kept on asking why and where he was (we had not been able to prepare her mentally this time).

Today morning, 3 days after the sudden disappearance of her grandfather, my daughter wanted to talk to him. We told her that he was at the hospital and could not talk. Throughout the day her mood was different from other days (irritated and restless). She took a few items that my dad had been using daily and kept asking about him. In the evening, she started crying that she wanted her grandfather. We somehow distracted her and she's asleep now. We are not sure how to handle the situation tomorrow. Any advice?

Update: Thanks so much all of you for sharing your experiences. The morning after she went to bed irritated and restless we took her out on a stroll. She loves the outdoors and is calmer in the midst of trees and birds. My wife and I first made her listen to/feel our hearts and then went on to tell her that her grandfather's heart wasn't working and that he would not be able to talk and listen. We showed her a photo of her grandfather and told her that she could ""talk"" to the photo whenever she wanted to. We told her that he's a star now. She listened to us carefully and seemed to be processing the information. She has been calmer since that the day. I'm sure that more questions will come.

He didn't go to preschool (he went to college with me,) he doesn't have siblings, doesn't have cousins, while he does have playdates they're only once every couple of months when me and my mom friend can link our schedules. He's very sweet and likes everybody, he's just awkwardly picking up on what other children do and trying to mimic it in ways that are disruptive.

I'm kind of realizing my son is seven with no real friends because interacting with other parents makes me anxious. 

His teachers feel like if he had more playdates with students he likes in his class that some of these behaviors would sort themselves out and they gave me a list of kids he works well with and their parent's names...I just don't know if I can do it.

I'm headed back to work, second shift and my S/O and I are in the process of closing on a house. But, I feel if I wait to tell them that they need to respect my wishes, the situation will only get worse. They are not respectful people. They constantly roll their eyes and make sneering faces when I bring things up. They're both small town, closed-minded red necks who subscribe the the notion that because their kids didn't turn out to be methheads, their way of parenting is the way I should be doing it. 
I've asked them repeatedly to keep the rescue pitbull away from my daughter. They've disregarded my wishes on that a dozen times over. I brought up the fact that I intend on making her baby food and not feeding her any processed sugars, butters or dairy due to the fact that she has genetic predispositions towards diabetes and dental problems. They sneered at that. When I said her gums are bothering her, they suggested putting whiskey on her gums. I said absolutely not and the Father's girlfriend said ""I did it with my girl and she turned out okay!""

I have a 14 year old kid. He's definitely not a football star type or even close to it. Think marching band / gamer here, only slower

He's already 6' 1"" due to a giant growth spurt in the last 3 years, he was growing so fast that it hurt him to breath (rib growth). He's past the pains, but he's still growing. Doc projects 6'5 -6'8

Physical activity has been extremely minimal through this period

The other day the P.E. Teacher made him run with a 30+ lb backpack on due to an active shooter drill they were doing.

No warm up, no stretching, no tightening the back pack, so it was basically uncontrolled weight bouncing around...just RUN, backpacks on

I flipped out. Not just about him, but all the other kid carrying bags just as heavy as his running, even a short distance like this with no prep and uncontrolled weight

At one point I was a hardcore weightlifter. All that raced through my mind was everything above with at least a prep to avoid injury. Nothing. 

I'm thinking torn knees, lower back injury, growth plate injury, falling, shoulder injuries etc due to an unsecured, uncontrolled 30lb backpack flopping around on a kids back.

Oh, and he was wearing boots. Didn't even let him change into gym shoes. 30lb backpack + boots...

I contacted the school and the P.E. teacher and let them have it. 

Again, my concern was not just for my kid, but all the rest of them as well being required to keep these backpacks on and just RUN.

In my head, making kids just RUN with this kind of weight unsecured, and bouncing around on their backs, without regard to possible injury, is reckless at best.

Sometimes it's in the middle of the night to use our bathroom (which we are completely fine with- the other bathroom requires navigating stairs which I'm uncomfortable with him doing in the middle of the night). However there are two other wake up behaviors we are trying to curb. 

The first one is that he wakes up in the middle of the night multiple times sometimes and just comes in our bedroom and stands ar the end of the bed. When he does this, I quietly walk him back to his room, and put him in the bed with a hug and kiss.  Sometimes this is a one time thing and sometimes it takes like 3 times.  

The other thing he does is wakes up only a little too early, like one hour. I have tried to get him to play quietly in his room for a little while but he doesn't really get what I'm saying.

I did buy one of those clocks that you can set to be red until a certain time, and then it turns green.  I initially introduced it too early I think (like 4 months ago) and he didnt really understand so I stopped using it. 

Does anyone have any ideas on how I can teach him to stay in bed at the appropriate times? I want him to come to the bathroom when he has to go but not a bunch of times a night or when it's like an hour before it's time to get up.

My son was born overseas 5 years ago and around his first birthday I got a visa for his mom and they both got to come to the US. I went back to school, but things weren't working out with his mom and she left us both when I was a junior. I managed to finish school as a single parent and have secured a good job, but my son's emotional development kinda paused when his mom left. She hasn't visited in about a year and he is struggling with that mightily. 


He goes to weekly counseling, but at the school where he went to preschool we were basically asked to not come back for kindergarten due to his behavior, and now that he's been at a new school for kindergarten his principal already wants to meet with me about his behavior.


At home he is usually wonderful, but occasionally he has sudden, awful mood swings and commits a lot of ""attention seeking"" type issues: saying bad words when he's angry, refusing to eat for long periods of time, telling me he wants to leave and never come back. He cries almost every night before bed asking when I am going to get him a new mommy, and sometimes while grocery shopping he asks strangers if they will be his mommy. I had to move back into my mom's house recently so I could have some help getting him picked up from school and to help her as she goes through some medical issues, and he begs her to let him call her mommy. The kid is clearly struggling.


His issues at school so far seem to circle around misunderstanding social cues and boundaries: hugging, pushing, etc. Friday I was informed he jabbed another kid with a pencil. He told me he was showing him where his grandma's IV is, his teacher described it as ""stabbing."" Now the principal wants to meet with me. His last school used to complain about the same thing, that he didn't understand boundaries and ignored social cues if they inconvenienced his impulses.


To clarify, he has been tested 3 different times to see if he is on the spectrum and all 3 times I was told he shows no sign of it but does have some eccentric behaviors I should keep an eye on, like answering questions indirectly (Question: Is this box a square? Answer: It is not a circle, triangle, or hexagon.). I want him tested for ADD or ADHD, but I fear it could be something deeper. Academically he excels, all of his school work is great and he is on pace with the rest of his class. And usually it is only in the afternoon that he has issues, after behaving perfectly fine in the morning. This is the same both at home and at school. This led me to believe it could be dietary but dietary changes have not noticeably helped.


Running out of options here, he is a smart boy. Super affectionate and sweet, goes out of his way to help his grandma. He is my world and I want him to be happy and do well in school. But he seems to have no impulse control and acts out often. I don't want him getting booted from kindergarten, right now I am just checking my phone over and over hoping there isn't a message from his teacher. I just want him to make it to Wednesday at this point.


Anyone else gone through this and could help? I tried searching around and couldn't find anyone going through the same situation

If I can pass the parenting responsibilities to my partner or other family I will 100% of the time. If I didn‚Äôt have such involved family members, if something ever happened to my husband or siblings or parents I don‚Äôt think I could actually parent my own children. 

I worked with high risk teenagers for years and I loved them, I feel though because I could be emotionally removed it was a lot easier to manage their needs and desires. That was 10 years ago. Behaviourally my kids are really on par with their peers. Bright, vivacious, generally thoughtful and even still waking up to parent is so hard for me. If parenting was a job I could quit, I would....but I don‚Äôt want to.

I want to desperately enjoy it, I want my kids to feel I love them (I do) but I think they mostly hear me say I love them. I have gone through ups and downs in my parenting skill level but it‚Äôs still abysmal. I keep my kids alive, fed, clothed and with their creature comforts but I‚Äôm not engaging and I‚Äôm rarely fun with them. I am serious, authoritative and curt and every single day as a parent feels like an endurance test. My mother cries when she watches me parents (to the point, usually with a very cool attitude). I don‚Äôt withhold affection and my kids seek affection a lot but generally I have to think to be conscious to give them the affection they want without their coming to me. Luckily my partner and my other family LIVE for my kids joy. I seem to live for their management. 

I have severe mental health issues (depression, bipolar, borderline personality disorder) and then a lot of historical trauma. I planned on not having children but that‚Äôs a medical nightmare story in its own right. 

How do other parents who may feel similarly all the time like me, or even some of the time manage themselves? I want happy rounded kids but I am not even that for myself, I‚Äôm doing my very best but I feel like every day is a Groundhog Day of emotional endurance tests when it‚Äôs really, the most basic parenting for pretty good kids in general. I‚Äôve been in intensive therapy for 12 years, medicated for just as long and very involved with child protection professionally. My life is saturated with kids, mine and others and I‚Äôm struggling. It has less to do kids I think and more to do with my brain. Parenting on fire....am I alone? I feel like I am...","Love my kids but hate parentingThrowaway account.

It's so bad that it takes 30 minutes just to get her dressed (which is the worst part of the morning) and then getting her hair done (she is biracial and it's not an option to not ""do"" her hair, but it takes 30 seconds to do), socks and shoes and using the potty before we get in the car take another 20+ minutes. I don't have an hour to get her ready. I get up early to get myself all ready and then wake her and get her ready. The longer it takes, the worse rush hour traffic gets and the later I am to work. It is a nightmare.

She is picky about what shirt she wears (it has to have a cat or a unicorn, and she has LOTS of shirts with these things, but she has slowly started to only like about 2 of her shirts) and she only likes leggings. Ok fine, she has a drawer full of leggings. She gets to pick her clothes. Any that are in the drawer and there are about 12 pairs of pants and probably 15 shirts. She won't pick. She doesn't want her PJs off. So then I pick and she gets hysterical. Like throw herself around, try to bite and hit me, hysterical. So I walk away and she calms down, brings me a shirt. I put it on and she FREAKS OUT. Tries to rip the shirt off, bites the shirt then complains it's wet. Rinse and repeat until she is satisfied (which, by the way, could be with a previously rejected shirt, doesn't seem to matter). I have tried to physically force a shirt on her and she fights, screams, cries and then takes it off. I've tried to leave her but she will happily get in the car naked and then I have to have the same fight in the parking lot of daycare, except now there are no choices since I brought one outfit and it's worse (plus its going to get cold soon). Her teachers are too busy to get her dressed in the morning and they shouldn't have to do that.

It's been suggested to have her sleep in her clothes for the next day, but she is so tired at bedtime she fights me on her PJ choices too so I know I'll have that fight at bedtime instead of the morning and she'll be more riled up for bed (it already takes over an hour to get her down). 

Getting her socks and shoes, her hair done and her to sit on the potty (we tried to leave with her not going potty and had to pull over a block away to let her pee on the grass - which is fine right now but will not work in the winter, plus I can't pull over once we get on the highway).

So this kid lives two doors down. My son is 5, he is 7. This kid is the child of a drug addict who does not have a father in the picture.

I don‚Äôt let my son into his house cause who knows what‚Äôs in there - the mother is a heroin addict.

But the grand parents let this kid roam free all the time and he is always screaming and running down the street, ringing my doorbell when my 2 year old is sleeping. This kid almost always hurts my son - like 10 minutes ago he drenched him with the hose.

My son is high functioning autism and obsesses over this kid. 

I had a period of time where I thought I‚Äôd be like a neighborhood dad to this kid , but he really is such an annoying kid- it broke my heart when I realized it - that I have to worry about mine and not him.

Any advice on how to mitigate this is appreciated.

Tummy noises,Parenting,4,dbo1ug,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dbo1ug/tummy_noises/,0,1569932843.0,"I didn't know where else to post this story but since it involves my mother and now me I figured it would be fitting. It's very wholesome and Just gives me so much appreciation for my mom now that I'm a mother myself. 

To begin, my parents got divorced around me and my twin brother's seventh birthday and my sisters first year of college. We were all pretty confused because they never showed the negative parts of their relationship infront of us. They were very considerate in that aspect and I'm grateful for that. Both wonderful people and great to us. When we were told what was going to happen my brother and I thought (as children) it would be cool to have two houses, my dad worked nights and slept during the day so we didn't see him as much as we did my mom anyway. Even divorced they never talked badly about eachother or let us see them down.

We didn't know how hard things were on both of them for a while, ofcourse we never knew until we were adults. I remember for a while my brother and I would lay with my mom in her bedroom before going to sleep to read stories or just talk about our days. I distinctly remember hearing her stomach making very loud, grumbling, gurgling noises almost constantly. We would laugh about it and my mom would make an excuse and smile along ""must not have eaten enough dinner"" or ""better watch out I must be gassy tonight"". For a long time we would talk about mom's tummy noises at bedtime. We'd go to our beds after and that was that.

I am now a mother of two small boys (one will be 5 in December, one just turned 2) while I am married to their father and we are making it, life hasn't been easy for almost a year now. My husband drives truck for work so it's me and the boys during the week, sometimes two weeks at a time. We are currently in a financial situation where our budget will be tight paying off some major bills that will take up to a year to pay off completely, I'm always on the move and still trying to have fun and give them the time and interest they deserve every day. At night the three of us cuddle and sing songs, talk about school or read books. I try so hard to push all the worries and stress out of my mind during our down time. I have suffered from general anxiety disorder and some depression for over 10 years now but I manage. Last night I felt very overwhelmed from my day. I cried in the shower and put on a happy face for the boys as soon as I got out. We sat down to relax and so our usual when our oldest son said ""was that a toot?"" Because my stomach made a loud noise. I told him no it was just my stomach. It quietly continued to make noises almost the entire time we were reading. They kept giggling and I said ""jeez! I guess I should've eaten more dinner!"" knowing completely that it was my nerves being shot for the day and all the thoughts in my head making me feel sick to my stomach. As soon as I said that it brought me back to my mom.

Today, I called my mom after dinner and told her about it. I didn't want to make her feel ashamed I was just curious. I said ""mom, do you remember your stomach making those noises when we'd lay in bed with you too.. I know mine is from *list of concerns, thoughts and such in our daily life*. I know we'll be ok, I'm just so stressed recently!"" She cracked and told me about many struggles she faced when we were young, some I had no clue about. She told me how some days she would drop us off at school. Smile, wave and blow us kisses then have to pull over a couple miles away on her way to work to cry her eyes out. Some nights she wouldn't eat dinner if it was our favorite meal because she knew we would want seconds. I cried and felt such a strong love for her when I heard all of this. It made me feel awful for my teenage years when I was the rebel and stupid. But it was eye opening.. I am now feeling what she felt, I hope to try and appear as ok and strong as my mom did for us.

To clarify, she was definitely worse off financially than we currently are as well. We grew up very poor for a while after the divorce, while we aren't poor, we have lots to pay off and build on with other different problems we face. As well as juggling the many things I do every day.","Tummy noisesI didn't know where else to post this story but since it involves my mother and now me I figured it would be fitting. It's very wholesome and Just gives me so much appreciation for my mom now that I'm a mother myself. 

To begin, my parents got divorced around me and my twin brother's seventh birthday and my sisters first year of college. We were all pretty confused because they never showed the negative parts of their relationship infront of us. They were very considerate in that aspect and I'm grateful for that. Both wonderful people and great to us. When we were told what was going to happen my brother and I thought (as children) it would be cool to have two houses, my dad worked nights and slept during the day so we didn't see him as much as we did my mom anyway. Even divorced they never talked badly about eachother or let us see them down.

We didn't know how hard things were on both of them for a while, ofcourse we never knew until we were adults. I remember for a while my brother and I would lay with my mom in her bedroom before going to sleep to read stories or just talk about our days. I distinctly remember hearing her stomach making very loud, grumbling, gurgling noises almost constantly. We would laugh about it and my mom would make an excuse and smile along ""must not have eaten enough dinner"" or ""better watch out I must be gassy tonight"". For a long time we would talk about mom's tummy noises at bedtime. We'd go to our beds after and that was that.

Is this normal for parents or is this a sign we shouldn't have a second kid?,Parenting,11,dbjei2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dbjei2/is_this_normal_for_parents_or_is_this_a_sign_we/,27,1569911011.0,"I'm a SAHM (for the first 18mo) and husband works a stressful F/T job in law enforcement. Our kid is 1yo.

I have no problems taking on the lion's share of the housework and kid and mental load. Our baby was not an easy baby. She was colicky, high maintenance, developed fear of strangers and carseats early on and still, and is all-in-all a bit high needs. That and she slept, well, never. (She's sleep trained now).

We're discussing having a second kid because we always envisioned being a family of four. My concern is that my husband and I are both introverts. Give us Netflix and a bag of chips and our night is made. When he comes home after a very long and stressful day, he likes to unwind with TV and his phone to check personal emails, messages, the latest sports scores, etc. So in the two hours he has from coming home to when our kid goes to bed, he'll play with her, help clean up the house, help bathe her, and help put her to sleep. He's really a wonderful father.

But then there are really small moments I notice where he won't ""jump to the occasion."" For example, when we're eating dinner, he'll eat in front of the TV and I eat at a table next to her high chair. When we're done, he'll just still be in front of the TV and I'll be cleaning her up, washing dishes, etc. I'll ask him to go take her out of the high chair, and he'll do it happily, but he'll do it and then kind of half-watch TV and half-play with her. It won't necessarily be his initiative to sit next to her during dinner or to grab her the second she's done to play. And if he's not doing it, then I'm the one who has to do it.

I know how tiresome his job can be so I want to protect his few precious moments of relaxation as much as possible. My fear is that having another kid just eliminates these moments and they'll drain us more than they will fill our tank. On top of that, I don't want even more caregiving to fall on me while he's unwinding from his day. I have a sibling myself (he doesn't) so I know that while sometimes we got along and we got out of our parents' hairs, there were also many, many years of fighting where we caused our parents a lot of grief.

Long story short, do you think it'd be a good idea to add a second kid to our lives? Big question. We keep going back and forth.

It shouldn't be life threatening but there are risks like losing partial sight. I just really don't know how to explain to him dad is going to be in the hospital for awhile getting surgery and what it means. He's extremely smart and has good understanding but he also has adhd and is medicated I'm worried this kind of news will cause him to freak out and act out. I'm in touch with his psychiatrist but unfortunately we can't get an appointment until after my surgery which doesn't really help with this problem.

Daycare requiring a year-long contract,Parenting,57,dbbomb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dbbomb/daycare_requiring_a_yearlong_contract/,57,1569879479.0,"My daughter's in-home daycare is preparing new contracts for the 2020 year and has removed the 2-week termination notice. Instead, they are requiring us to put in writing the expected scope of care for the year (Full year, January-June, etc...), and if we take our daughter out early, we must pay for the amount of care we originally planned.

In our example, we are planning to move her to a pre-K program in September. If we decide for any reason to take her out sooner, we are on the hook for payments up until September. This could potentially be **thousands of dollars** for care we would not receive. 

Has anyone heard of this? The daycare is requiring us to essentially sign a lease with no flexibility to leave. I have already told the provider that I will not sign this kind of agreement, and we are waiting for their response.

A little more background; the provider's daughter took over operations of the daycare at the beginning of the year. Since January, she has:

* increased the price 8%, 
* extended **paid vacation from 2 weeks to** **5 weeks** (in addition to 12 holidays)
* Changed hours of operation from 6 PM close to 5:30 PM, which is a big deal for many parents

The removal of a reasonable termination notice (usually 2-4 weeks) is just one more in a series of bad policy changes. I'm not sure how to proceed at this point, but I think we may have to find an alternative provider.","Daycare requiring a year-long contractMy daughter's in-home daycare is preparing new contracts for the 2020 year and has removed the 2-week termination notice.

My 6 year old kicked her teacher.,Parenting,19,dbfur6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dbfur6/my_6_year_old_kicked_her_teacher/,22,1569896699.0,"Some background: My daughter just turned 6. She's in 1st grade. Since Pre-K we've been dealing with some behavior issues at school. It started with yelling (mostly at other kids when they were being too loud or not listening). Last year she pinched a friend and threw her bookbag at a group of kids standing in line (she wanted to be line leader). This year she has pushed kids (line leader issue again) and today she kicked her teacher.  

None of the issues originated at home. We don't use physical violence in our home. We give timeouts for cooling down. We practice deep breathing, mindfulness, and yoga. The more issues she seems to have at school the more it starts to bleed over at home. Getting really defiant this year when she never was at home before.

She is in play therapy and we are seeking assessment for anxiety (it doesn't take much to send her into a panic) and sensory issues (she covers her ears and screams when there are loud noises - automatic flushers are the bane of her existence).

She is a smart kid. She can count to 100 and knows how to read easy books. She's never showed having a difficult time with the class work.

I spoke with her school counselor today about getting a referral for counseling outside the school.

We've told her over and over that we don't hit people. We use our words, we count and breathe, we separate ourselves from the situation.

I feel horrible. It's like she's struggling with something that I can't help her with. She wasn't like this before. She's always been so sweet and lovey. She's a little beacon of positivity, always telling people they look nice and being super friendly. She's always been extremely sensitive, but I feel like that has been a good thing outside of school. At school her sensitivity just seems to make more issues for her.

Looked online and can't find anything about parenting after having hernia surgery.

I'm at a total loss. Could really use some guidance on parenting a rambunctious two year old when they are stronger than you.","Help!

So several months ago, our baby got sick. It was a mysterious fever and lethargy and nobody could figure out what it was. After numerous doctor visits and no answers, we finally took her to the ER where one doctor finally figured out she had something called Kawasaki Disease. It's a rare illness that causes inflammation in the blood vessels all over your body and it only affects babies and toddlers. Nobody really knows what causes it; there's no vaccine or preventative measure that could have stopped her from getting it. And since she'd had it for awhile before anyone figured it out, she was at an increased risk of the biggest complication with it, which is coronary aneurysm. She was hospitalized for almost a week, and during that time she also somehow contracted parainfluenza from someone at the hospital, so she had to be put on quarantine; the whole situation was extremely traumatic for her and absolutely heartbreaking for us as well. We truly didn't know if we would lose her and I cannot describe the horror of that, it's more than words can convey. She is recovering but will continue to be under the care of a cardiologist until early next year at least, to make sure her heart recovers completely. 

We were already drowning in the flood of medical expenses our insurance didn't cover, but were somehow managing not to allow anything to go into collections, until yesterday when the the shit just totally hit the fan. My husband, who is one of the most hardworking and loyal employees imaginable and has NEVER lost a job in his life, was suddenly laid off. The reason? One of his boss's oldest friends needed a job. So rather than letting my husband know in advance and giving him a chance to find something else, this ASSHOLE kept it to himself until THE DAY BEFORE he was putting his friend on the schedule and then just told my husband he was laid off. No severance, nothing. This guy is fucking evil. He knows our situation, as well. He knows my husband has a family and a child who needs medical care, that we recently closed on a new home, that we both have car payments and that my income is nowhere near enough to cover any of it on my own. I cannot believe the heartlessness of this guy. 

So anyway... we're screwed. Obviously we're both frantically applying for new positions (me to try to make a little more, and him to get something -- ANYTHING -- so we don't lose everything), we've applied for assistance but were told it would take probably 30 days before we know if we're approved, and until then, LO is just going to have to go without care because we can't use our small savings to pay for doctors appointments while we lose our home and transportation. I have no idea what to do. 

I created a gofundme awhile back and posted it on FB and here as well, but obviously there are people in much worse situations and I don't expect many people to give; we just don't know that many people and the ones we do aren't rich either. They all have their own struggles and I understand and can't expect them to put themselves in a worse situation to make ours better. 

I don't know what I'm hoping for; maybe some reassurance? Maybe some stories of people who've been in similar situations and wound up okay? We're so scared and lost; we've never been in this kind of position. You think if you go to work every day and work your ass off, they're not going to suddenly let you go after years for such a random and ridiculous reason. Especially with no warning. I can't wrap my head around it.","We are having a really tough time and I am kind of terrified, just want to tell someone, not sure where to go nextTl'dr: Our baby got sick and continues to need medical care, which was already killing us financially, but yesterday my husband was laid off for the most ridiculous reason ever, so now we're totally screwed and I'm not sure what to do.

So of course I took scissors and markers to my clothes, sewing needles to my ears, razors to my hair, sharpie to my skin, and smuggled makeup from the Avon lady. 

So when I had my own kid I vowed to let her express herself with only the lightest direction from me (baring anything damaging). She has a severe asymmetrical artsy haircut, wears galaxy makeup on her forehead with crystals for Stars some days, has neon pink eyebrows the next and most days she‚Äôs natural. Her clothes are super funky and we just escaped a very cringey style experiment. But she back to custom design by her dresses and tunics. She could could be a hunger games capital child extra on her on days no problem. 

She has so much confidence she literally unbullyable and I couldn‚Äôt be prouder. I‚Äôve had many whispering matches with relatives to hold their tongue, but everyone is on board now. Her classmates dig her style. But the question is... 

When to let her get her ears pierced?

I was hoping the nearly unlimited expression with regards to hair, henna, and fashion would keep it at bay but she‚Äôs literally the only kid her age at her school/social group without them.

I thought she would wait till she was 7+ to start seriously asking. I have no real reason to say no like with permanent tattoos.

She‚Äôs been asking since she was three but like hell did she understand the implications at all so she got stickers. Then later I was able to placate her want with crystal stickers and clip-ons. But she grew tired of them either falling off constantly or giving her ear aches from the pressure. I tried putting her off it by telling her about the needles and watching YouTube videos but now she‚Äôs just more sure. 

I feel like a hypocrite, my gut says wait. Even though I got mine when I was 4 and a half and officially when I was 5. My parent group is saying I‚Äôm a hypocrite so I guess I‚Äôm ask for your opinion and perspective.

Are we just shitty parents? (TW: DV),Parenting,2,dblz8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dblz8d/are_we_just_shitty_parents_tw_dv/,12,1569922596.0,"Our oldest just turned 5. For about two years now we've felt like she constantly has the need to battle us. And only us. Every single day. Multiple meltdowns per day. Doesn't matter how much we praise and reward or discipline. Although recently, she started being rude and defiant to other family too. At school she is apparently an angel, so far. Parent-teacher conferences are coming up so we'll see how she is doing with everyone and herself at school but so far I have only heard good things. 

She's intelligent. She's sweet. She's so creative. She reads a lot, she reads me books while I've been sick and reads to her little brother. She's curious and innovative. There's so much to love about her.. But the meltdowns and extreme defiance are this giant cloud over her.

She started off in Pre-k over a month ago, she got tested and was put into Kindergarten (Montessori that includes Pre-K kids to learn from the kindergartners) and recommended for the G/T program. The transition didn't change her behavior in a good or bad way, surprisingly. She's more independent since they learn life skills. 

While at home or away from school, most days are filled with her constantly whining about every little thing. Constantly. Every thirty minutes or so  She'll be hyperfocused on what's going on two weeks from now, asking random things from years or months ago every five minutes, repeating things over and over... She's hyper.. Constantly. No matter what she has done that day or week. Rarely will she be tired and if she's tired before bed time then that means she's getting sick. I try to believe maybe she's overtired sometimes and getting that second wind. 

 I know for sure she must have sensory issues. She gags on many foods and doesn't like to eat many foods. I made pancakes the other day, some with chocolate chips and some without. She ate the ones with chocolate chips just fine, but the ones without them she literally gagged. She is a kid that says ""I don't like chicken or potatoes but I like chicken nuggets and fries"" even though she rarely eats that. She gags on anything different. I've tried so many approaches with food. It is a battle every day. Even now, I make her lunches and she eats them sometimes or she gets her teacher to throw most of it away. 

And she still does this thing where she puts her stomach/pelvis on the edge of something and pushes against it and opens and closes her legs. We had told her pediatrician about it and they tested her for seizures but they couldn't get her to do it for observation. It's not a seizure though, seems to be a sensory thing but I'm not sure what triggers it. They said ""maybe she'll grow out of it"". She does it when we aren't looking now because we've told her that it's a private thing to do. So if one of us walks in, she jumps up. Can't catch it anymore but I have videos of it from when she was about 2 years old. There's periods where she'll stop,I think. She only does it at home. 



She's started lying too, started a few months ago. So I can't believe what she says. She went as far as to say her teacher hit her the other day and I only knew she was lying because she said it with a smile. She lies a lot and it takes a lot to get her to be honest 

Her bio-dad (voluntarily not involved at all, abandoned her) was diagnosed with several mental disorders including bipolar disorder and was in the process of getting diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder... Can't ask him or his family about anything genetic because he tried(and admitted to police and others) to kill us and his family will tell him and they also don't care that she exists. He said he wanted to carry on his blood and then forced himself on me, they're how little he actually cared. I don't know about anything other than what he told me and what was revealed by authorities. That's my biggest worry. Because he can't even function in society. I just want her to have a decent life and be happy... Not be like him.. He hates himself and everyone and everything.

Tl;dr: Every day for the last two years has been filled with 5 year old being rude, extremely defiant, lying, and not showing any emotional progress. Are we just shitty parents or should I be worried? Trying to focus on positive but it's difficult when the bad is... Horrible. I'm worried about her happiness.","Are we just shitty parents?

About three months ago we took in my wife's 14 year old nephew. My SIL is a trainwreck and basically had zero desire to be a mother anymore and the kid got suicidal due to the mistreatment he was receiving.

So I drove from Michigan to Oregon and picked him up and we've opened the doors if our home to him.

For reference we've been together 20 years and have no children of our own (I can't have kids) and we in no way thought this was going to be easy but we're in over our heads!

The first month or so he was great. So happy to be out of an abusive household that he was an angel. Did whatever my wife or her mother asked of him (MIL lives with us as well) and was very positive to have in the house.

After that things started to get really bad. His mom is a great piece of work. Loves to tell him she hates him, posts on social media that she's glad he's gone, etc...

She was also pretty abusive to him and frankly did whatever was easiest for herself and pretty much let the kid do whatever he pleased if she wasn't beating on him because she snapped. By 12 he had already run away from home, started smoking and doing drugs, dropped out of school, and was sneaking out of the house at night...

We've tried to establish boundries for him but are struggling. We've been able to curb a lot of his bad habits but are still struggling with some unacceptable behaviors. He is still smoking and we're catching it. My wife caught him abusing his ADHD med and I'm having to address disrespectful behavior to my wife and MIL.

Big issue is finding ways to change his behaviors. Positive rewards have zero impact on him. He won't stick with anything long enough to actual achieve the goal, almost like he's self sabotaging himself. Punishments are a joke as the kid is used to getting beat on... He will literally just sit in his room and stare at the wall and is content to do so.

He doesn't do what he's supposed to do (or chores, schoolwork, activities we've set up for him) and we've already taken videogames, television, phone and hobby privledges away... He won't stay out of trouble long enough to actually get out of the hole...

Looking for advice on custody and being the best parent,Parenting,0,dblr6x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dblr6x/looking_for_advice_on_custody_and_being_the_best/,4,1569921571.0,"I am looking for advice. Bear with me as I give some background into this messy life of mine. Definitely, straight out of soap opera.

Background story: My ex and I were on and off for 10 years, because he cheated and lied to me. In fall 2018, I left my friends and family and moved to live with him in a different state. Not long after I moved in, he cheated on me again and broke up with me. He then started dating the girl that he cheated on me with. A little background story about her: she lives in a different state, works in the same company as my ex, and is separated from her husband with 2 kids. My ex and her are having a long-distance relationship.

Not long after my breakup and him dating again, I found out that I was pregnant. Just a FYI, I was on the IUD and it dislodged. I informed my ex, the first thing he asked me was if I was going to get an abortion. The next couple of weeks, he pressured me and persuaded me to get an abortion. But I just couldn‚Äôt do it. I gave him the option to be a dad or to get a second chance at life. Without hesitation, he decided to take a second chance. I was devastated and very disappointed at his choice. I was pregnant alone and scared. I didn't have the courage to tell my family nor my friends. I didn't want to move back to my home state pregnant. My family are very traditional and strict. In addition, my mom has high hopes for me b/c out of all my siblings, I beat teen pregnancy and I graduated college. I was the golden child. Having a child out of wedlock, it would be a disappointment to my family. The stress caused me to be depressed and quit my job. My ex and I talked and he said that I can live with him as his roommate until I am ready to move out.

Moving to the next week, while he's dating the girl, he cheated on her with me. His gf and him became on and off right off the bat. She would snoop through my social media and use the content as an excuse to break up with him. (This is still going on.) I was naive and I was being led on. I thought that we could be a family. So I asked him if he wants to be a dad, but before I could even finished my sentence, he said no. He still wants to be a bachelor. I was an idiot and thought that if I involve him throughout my pregnancy and that maybe he will change his mind. It didn't. He went to 2 dr's appointment and decided not to go anymore. He doesn't bother asking when my next dr appointments would be.

What bothered me a lot and I addressed it with him was during his visits to his gf. He would ignore my texts and calls. There were a couple of times whereas, I ended up in the ER b/c I was bleeding. When the incidents happened, he was traveling and ignored my calls/texts. He did not even bother to ask if I was okay. We would fight whenever he came back from his trip. During this time, I was still in love with him while he was falling for his gf. I was jealous and upset b/c he is ready to be a step-dad but not a dad to his own kid. I was salty af.

As hard as it was, I got myself a new job that I love. My ex and I still kept our affair while he was dating. When I was 5 months pregnant, he wanted to be a part of my child's life. My ex and I decided that we would need to talk about co-parenting. Unfortunately, he would not want to have a conversation with me. Especially when he was visiting his gf, he would ignore me and I would assume that he doesn't want to be a dad. We would have horrible fights whereas, I would want some space and try to walk out of the room and he would pin me down and hold me against my will. He said that he doesn't want me to go out especially at times when it was dark. I have to remind him to be careful b/c I am pregnant. I was so emotionally depressed that I finally told my friends and family that I was pregnant and what was going on. They were happy for me. They told me to move home. I told them that I will after the birth of my baby.

At 7 months pregnant, he and I stopped having an affair b/c he stated that he saw forever in his gf. They discussed the future. He would move to her state. They exchanged rings. They also gave each other ultimatums: his gf wanted me to move out and as for him, he wanted her to finalize her divorce. Finally, at this time, I gave up on him and the love I had for him turned into hate. I began preparing for the birth of my baby. I bought baby things and prepped for my baby shower. I drove several times back and forth to my home state. It was a rough 10 hours drive. Flights were too expensive and I had dogs.

Finally nearing the birth of my child, I put my foot down and told my ex that he does not deserve to be a dad. I've been alone throughout my pregnancy. I did not have his support. I was tired of waiting for a response. He dragged it for 10 months. I told him that although I don't want him to be a dad, I want his parents involved b/c I want my child to have grandparents. My mom is severely sick. She won't be able to have the opportunity to be my child's grandma. My dad is not relatively close to me and doesn't want to be involved in my life. He said no and also that he doesn't want to be in the room while I give birth. He said that I can do it alone.

On the day of the birth of my baby, I started my unpaid 6-week maternity leave and my bff traveled from my home state to be there b/c she didn't want me to be alone. Out of the blue, my ex said that he would be there in the hospital room for me and not my child. I said okay. When my child was born, it was emotional and he automatically fell in love with my child. After giving birth, I was hemorrhaging and almost died. I was pumped with drugs and my ex used this time to try to persuade me to give him sole custody. After feeling better, he got me to agree to have him on the birth certificate and my child to have his last name.

He told his parents and they were ecstatic to be grandparents. Before being discharged, the dr said that my child had severe jaundice and needs to go through light treatment at home. At 3 days old, my child was going through the light treatment. My ex lied to me and told me he needed to travel for work. I knew that he made plans to visit his gf. I was upset that he would put his gf as priority over our sick child. I was healing as well from giving birth and that was not taken into consideration. I called him that I needed him home b/c I was bleeding and need to go to the ER. He said no. Then he ignored my calls/texts.

When he came back, I wasn't as angry as I was. I told him that it was okay b/c I forgot that he chose a second chance and I should have not expected him to take the responsibility as a dad. He told me that he didn't see anything wrong with him traveling, but since I addressed it with him, he felt ashamed about his decision. I told him that I can't forgive him.

Now, my child is 1 month and is breastfed. I got the call that my mom is sent to the ICU and is on life support. I asked if he can drive with me to visit my mom. He said no. I told him that my child will be on the trip too. He asked how severe was my mom's health. His question was so rude. I was pissed and asked why he needs to know how severe her condition is. He finally realized how stupid it was and said he would help me drive.

By this time, his gf and him has been on and off for 10 months. When we arrived to my home state, his gf dumped him b/c I was still living with him and she believed that there is something going on between him and I. She stated that the birth of my child brought him and I together. She created all of these scenarios that I manipulated him. She continues to create fake social media accounts and look through my contents. I confronted her and she denied. I even brought the issue to my ex. Due to the break up, nothing matters to him. He was angry and took his anger out on me by saying I fucked everything up for him and that he doesn't want me to drive back with him. I told him that I need to come back. I have a career and my things are there. I told him that he chose a wrong time to kick me out. I am grieving for my mom and I just got out of my 6 weeks unpaid maternity leave. I don't have the resources. He said that he doesn't care. Somehow, I was able to persuade him to let me come back.

However, not soon after arriving back, we got into an argument. I felt that he was neglecting his responsibility as a dad b/c he was letting his breakup affect his responsibility. The first night that we argued, he told me to leave. I grabbed my son and was about to leave the bedroom before he stopped me. He yanked my child from my arms. When I tried to get my child back, he twisted my wrists and used a lot of force on me. At one point, he put me in a head lock and I bit him really hard for him to let go. He set my child down and then he pinned me down. He used his weight and wouldn't let me up. I finally was able to get him off and then I grabbed my child. He grabbed my wrists and arms and attempted to stop me from leaving. I tried to call the police but he tossed my phone. He told me to stop being irrational. I told him that I need to get myself and my child to a safe place. He said that he would stop if I stay. So that's what I did.

The second night, it was round 2. He told me to leave and tried to take my child from me. I am tired of fighting. I do not have the resources at the moment to move home. I want to quit my job properly by giving the 2 weeks notice. I want to keep the network that I built there. My mom is in hospice care and will be off life support this week. I don't have a home to return if I were to move back. I want to have at least a job line up.

I told my ex that I will not allow him to have a relationship with my child b/c of what he did and is doing. I told him that I didn't want to be those spiteful moms that does not want the dads see their child due to personal issues. I feel like this is more than personal to me. I gave him too many chances to be a dad and he fucked up. The last straw is that he wants to kick me out to get back with his gf. I don't think it would be okay to expose this behavior to my child. My child and I would have no home to go to. I told him that he was never there during my pregnancy and treated me like shit.

How can I get out of this rut? I don't want child support. I don't want him to be a dad. How can I keep full custody? I tried finding resources and government help but not sure where to go from there. what can I do in this situation to protect my child and I?

TL;DR: Broke up with an ex and had a child. Want advice on how to deal with personal issues and keep full custody.","Looking for advice on custody and being the best parentI am looking for advice. Bear with me as I give some background into this messy life of mine. Definitely, straight out of soap opera.

Background story: My ex and I were on and off for 10 years, because he cheated and lied to me. In fall 2018, I left my friends and family and moved to live with him in a different state. Not long after I moved in, he cheated on me again and broke up with me. He then started dating the girl that he cheated on me with. A little background story about her: she lives in a different state, works in the same company as my ex, and is separated from her husband with 2 kids. My ex and her are having a long-distance relationship.

Not long after my breakup and him dating again, I found out that I was pregnant. Just a FYI, I was on the IUD and it dislodged. I informed my ex, the first thing he asked me was if I was going to get an abortion. The next couple of weeks, he pressured me and persuaded me to get an abortion. But I just couldn‚Äôt do it. I gave him the option to be a dad or to get a second chance at life. Without hesitation, he decided to take a second chance. I was devastated and very disappointed at his choice. I was pregnant alone and scared. I didn't have the courage to tell my family nor my friends. I didn't want to move back to my home state pregnant. My family are very traditional and strict. In addition, my mom has high hopes for me b/c out of all my siblings, I beat teen pregnancy and I graduated college. I was the golden child. Having a child out of wedlock, it would be a disappointment to my family. The stress caused me to be depressed and quit my job. My ex and I talked and he said that I can live with him as his roommate until I am ready to move out.

Moving to the next week, while he's dating the girl, he cheated on her with me. His gf and him became on and off right off the bat. She would snoop through my social media and use the content as an excuse to break up with him. (This is still going on.) I was naive and I was being led on. I thought that we could be a family. So I asked him if he wants to be a dad, but before I could even finished my sentence, he said no. He still wants to be a bachelor. I was an idiot and thought that if I involve him throughout my pregnancy and that maybe he will change his mind. It didn't. He went to 2 dr's appointment and decided not to go anymore. He doesn't bother asking when my next dr appointments would be.

What bothered me a lot and I addressed it with him was during his visits to his gf. He would ignore my texts and calls. There were a couple of times whereas, I ended up in the ER b/c I was bleeding. When the incidents happened, he was traveling and ignored my calls/texts. He did not even bother to ask if I was okay. We would fight whenever he came back from his trip. During this time, I was still in love with him while he was falling for his gf. I was jealous and upset b/c he is ready to be a step-dad but not a dad to his own kid. I was salty af.

As hard as it was, I got myself a new job that I love. My ex and I still kept our affair while he was dating. When I was 5 months pregnant, he wanted to be a part of my child's life. My ex and I decided that we would need to talk about co-parenting. Unfortunately, he would not want to have a conversation with me. Especially when he was visiting his gf, he would ignore me and I would assume that he doesn't want to be a dad. We would have horrible fights whereas, I would want some space and try to walk out of the room and he would pin me down and hold me against my will. He said that he doesn't want me to go out especially at times when it was dark. I have to remind him to be careful b/c I am pregnant. I was so emotionally depressed that I finally told my friends and family that I was pregnant and what was going on. They were happy for me. They told me to move home. I told them that I will after the birth of my baby.

At 7 months pregnant, he and I stopped having an affair b/c he stated that he saw forever in his gf. They discussed the future. He would move to her state. They exchanged rings. They also gave each other ultimatums: his gf wanted me to move out and as for him, he wanted her to finalize her divorce. Finally, at this time, I gave up on him and the love I had for him turned into hate. I began preparing for the birth of my baby. I bought baby things and prepped for my baby shower. I drove several times back and forth to my home state. It was a rough 10 hours drive. Flights were too expensive and I had dogs.

Finally nearing the birth of my child, I put my foot down and told my ex that he does not deserve to be a dad. I've been alone throughout my pregnancy. I did not have his support. I was tired of waiting for a response. He dragged it for 10 months. I told him that although I don't want him to be a dad, I want his parents involved b/c I want my child to have grandparents. My mom is severely sick. She won't be able to have the opportunity to be my child's grandma. My dad is not relatively close to me and doesn't want to be involved in my life. He said no and also that he doesn't want to be in the room while I give birth. He said that I can do it alone.

My son has started screaming when his dad asks for a kiss.,Parenting,11,db9h4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/db9h4m/my_son_has_started_screaming_when_his_dad_asks/,36,1569867704.0,"Ok so for months we have had the same routine, our son (1 year old and 3 weeks) will have his bath which his dad does while I relax or do chores that need sorting. After his bath he has his bottle then we give him 10/15 to let it settle before we both take him to bed. What usually happens is I go to the bedroom first and grab his blanket and dummy, my partner brings him through and sits on the bed with him. (When we realised my son could give kisses and was trying to, we noticed he wouldnt kiss the person who was holding him, only the people around him, if he wanted to.) So my partner would hand my son over to me, I would give him his blanket as he likes to cuddle it, then give his dad a kiss when he asked, sometimes he would do it without asking, sometimes he would give him lots of kisses to the point where my partner would eventually just have to leave or we would never get him to sleep. Very rarely he would refuse a kiss so we put that down to being over tired. 

Recently, the last 2 weeks or so, when it gets to bed time and my partner asks for a kiss from our son, instead of giving him one he will just scream and kick his legs. It's really getting to my partner who doesnt feel right without that kiss goodnight and I dont blame him, he has said he ""doesnt love me"" once or twice, after several days of not getting a kiss. Could it just be a phase? Or could we be putting him to bed too late so therefore over tired? During the day he gives his dad kisses without him asking and will hug him and play with him like normal, its just bedtime that has changed. I feel like we are just keeping him up too long before taking him to bed so he is getting over tired but my partner sometimes feels like he doesnt love him, which he knows is silly, but sometimes you cant help but feel a certain way. 

Any advice? 

TL:DR My 1 year old son has suddenly stopped giving his dad a kiss goodnight and starts screaming and crying. Is it a phase or could he just be overtired?

EDIT: Please don't comment telling me I need to respect my child etc, we do respect him, and if he doesnt want the kiss, we don't get one. Don't assume we don't respect our child. This isnt a normal thing for our son, he kisses EVERYONE and EVERYTHING to the point where I have to stop him kissing strangers or sometimes my phone when he has already kissed it twenty times and began leaving slobber. Any other time of the day, if he doesnt want a kiss he usually tells us by ignoring our question.

EDIT: Ok so I may have made it seem like my partner is constantly crying and getting upset all the time over this, that isnt the case. He gets upset at the time, then by the time I've got my son to sleep, hes forgotten about it. I have OCD and I tend to overthink a lot, it may not even be affecting my partner as much as I think, but like I said, I overthink sometimes especially when someone is telling me they are ok or something is fine when I feel otherwise.","My son has started screaming when his dad asks for a kiss.Ok so for months we have had the same routine, our son (1 year old and 3 weeks) will have his bath which his dad does while I relax or do chores that need sorting.

but at the parties the moms sit as groups and they completely ignore me and snub me..even when I approach some moms they hardly talk to me and some ignore me rudely and talk among themselves..I feel like I'm back to high school.. it's affecting my self esteem..

Now my daughter wants to have a birthday party next month and invite these moms and their kids..but they are all so rude ..","Rude mom cliques at School Gate and Birthday Parties

Getting desperate - Help with my 7 yo son's potty training,Parenting,5,dbbp7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dbbp7l/getting_desperate_help_with_my_7_yo_sons_potty/,19,1569879558.0,"Hi all! I'm pretty new to this sub, but I think this might be the best place to put this question. My 7 year old son pees on his own just fine, but we cannot get him to consistently poop in the potty. Regardless of whether he's playing with his Legos, his iPad, or playing outside he will hold it and allow small amounts of poop to come out and get on his underwear, sometimes resulting in us changing them 2-3 times a day at the extremes. I have expressed my desire to ""help him get through this"" and that ""I know he doesn't want to poop in his underwear"" trying my best not to be overly critical and be as understanding as possible, but I don't see it improving and we've even had to go pick him up from school before due to this. It's very difficult to lay out all of the circumstances and intricacies of our interactions about his poops but I feel like he's dancing a fine-line simply to avoid staying in the bathroom for a longer period of time. Whatever he's doing clearly is taking precedence and he doesn't want to be away from it any longer than is absolutely necessary. Sometimes it is obvious when he has to go and we will have to simply make him sit on the toilet until he goes.

I'm pretty new to this sub, but I think this might be the best place to put this question. My 7 year old son pees on his own just fine, but we cannot get him to consistently poop in the potty. Regardless of whether he's playing with his Legos, his iPad, or playing outside he will hold it and allow small amounts of poop to come out and get on his underwear, sometimes resulting in us changing them 2-3 times a day at the extremes. I have expressed my desire to ""help him get through this"" and that ""I know he doesn't want to poop in his underwear"" trying my best not to be overly critical and be as understanding as possible, but I don't see it improving and we've even had to go pick him up from school before due to this. It's very difficult to lay out all of the circumstances and intricacies of our interactions about his poops but I feel like he's dancing a fine-line simply to avoid staying in the bathroom for a longer period of time. Whatever he's doing clearly is taking precedence and he doesn't want to be away from it any longer than is absolutely necessary. Sometimes it is obvious when he has to go and we will have to simply make him sit on the toilet until he goes. Most of the time he will, but he complains and whines the entire time, like just being there is an inconvenience and he's missing out on something.

Advice on problems with my 6yr olds teacher?,Parenting,2,dbfroa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dbfroa/advice_on_problems_with_my_6yr_olds_teacher/,12,1569896364.0,"Hello lovely parents and guardians, Im looking for advice on building a relationship with my child's teacher. 
My son is 6 and in first grade, this is a new school with a new teacher and of course new kids. At my son's previous school, he took awhile to warm up and make friends but was excelling by the end of the first trimester. He was given awards for reading and comprehension. His kindergarten teacher wanted us to have him tested for the gifted and talented program, we were thrilled and had no reason to believe he had any issues with school. Cue to this school year with the new teacher, I go on the meet the teacher night and introduce myself and inform the teacher my son is dealing with hearing loss, that should be corrected by surgery in a few months, but has no issues at the moment other than possibly needing things at a louder volume/ sitting closer to the front of the room. (Recommendation by his DR and audiologist), I also informed the teacher that he was a great student in Pre-K and kinder. 

Several weeks go by and his teacher assess him for reading in a very low range, much lower than he reads at home, I speak with her and she's totally dismissive but tells me she will look into it, as she's been having the teaching assistant do the sight word assessment. Today I get an email from her saying she's pulled his records from the old school and noticed he's not on an IEP, I respond and inform her that his hearing loss is hopefully temporary, and if not we will look into it. His teacher then tells me that he has a speech delay, and has messy handwriting, and that means he needs to be put on an IEP. Here's the thing, he was tested extensively by his audiologist and they had 0 issues with his speech. He speaks in full proper sentences, and uses words I didn't think a 6 year old would say. 

I'm not trying to be ""that mom"" who thinks their kid can do no wrong and is the second coming of Jesus Christ and Albert Einstein combined, but I do know that my child is an excellent reader, and speaks very well. 

My son doesn't like his new class, he cries to go back to his old school, he doesn't feel like he has any friends and when I ask about his teacher he tells me she's grouchy and not very nice, (which I understand is coming from a 6yr old) 
I don't think she's made him feel very welcome or comfortable in the new school, and I feel like she's trying to make me out to be a braggart for telling her about his accomplishments at the old school. 

I go to conference with the teacher next week, and if anyone has any advice or tips I would gladly appreciate it, as of right now I'm so angry with the whole situation I'm having a hard time looking at it from and unbasied POV.","Advice on problems with my 6yr olds teacher?Hello lovely parents and guardians, Im looking for advice on building a relationship with my child's teacher.

One that includes pneumonia, miscarriage, the sudden suicide of a family member, an attempted suicide by drug overdose by another, my stepfather being diagnosed with hodgkin's lymphoma, two major car accidents (one involving my husband, daughter, and myself, the other just involving my husband), mother in law suffered a stroke recently so we are taking care of her, and a whole bunch of extra shit that has us at the end of our rope.

My husband and I are in therapy and going regularly to meetings for families who have miscarried or lost children. I also started taking prozac.

My ex is getting married later this year/early next year and I'm considering relinquishing my parental rights. 

It's something I have considered in the past, but I just feel pointless in her life, especially with all the life stressors and severe depression. She is happy at her father's home and obviously has a new mother. My daughter has even been discussing naming her future children after her ""new mom"". So  I take it she likes her.

Has any one pursued this? How do I proceed?","Considering relinquishing all my parental rightsI am the mother of a wonderful eight year old daughter. My husband and I co-parent (poorly) with my ex and his fiancee on a 5225 schedule.

We also realized he is super interested in the baby sign language so we've been teaching him how to sign to his little brother. So far so good! 

We also had a talk about how mommy isn't sick anymore and isn't going anywhere and he actually listened. We know for a fact his grandmother has been coaching him and telling him to act a certain way at my house so I will ""give up.""

PANDAS - anyone here have a kid diagnosed with this?,Parenting,5,db513v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/db513v/pandas_anyone_here_have_a_kid_diagnosed_with_this/,9,1569838928.0,"I'll try to keep this post as short as possible. Eldest daughter, 9 in November has a history of moderate anxiety. She has always been a ""High needs"" child. Bad colic and reflux as a baby, clingy toddler etc.

She  ( and her 7 year old sister) have been seeing a psychologist for a few years now, on and off. My husband was diagnosed with laryngneal cancer early last year and terminal lung cancer in May this year. My daughter's usual psychologist is on maternity  leave and yesterday she had an appointment  with a new psychologist.  We talked about my daughter's issues and I said that there has been a big change in her personality and behavior  since my husband's diagnosis, which is to be expected. New psychologist,  asked if my daughter has had a  Strep throat infection in the last few years. I remembered she  had got really sick with bad throat infection when my husband was in hospital  having his larynectomy  and that was around February last year. She had to have 2 courses of strong antibiotics,  ended up with a fever of 40¬∞C and a week off school - probably  picked up from being at the Hospital visiting her Dad. Looking back now, I remember a huge change in her behavior which I put down to everything that is happening  with her Dad. 

Changes in behavoiurs I noticed : She would have melt downs that would last sometimes hours and she would get very aggressive even though she isn't aggressive by nature , OCD like behaviours like being fussy with food after always eating everything and anything - even as a toddler to then being very food fixated and wanting to eat all the time, constantly  picking cuts and sores (thankfully she doesn't do that as much now) , severe seperation anxiety that she had mostly outgrown, toilet training accidents after being trained for some time. 

Although most of the above issues have improved in the last year, her new psychologist suggested that she may have/ had PANDAS which they think is triggered  by some kind of strep infection. I'd never heard of it, so did some research  last night on it. Seems to be one of those things that not all medical professionals agree on and some don't think it is even a real illness. My daughter does seem to have almost all of the signs and behaviours. Even though she is almost 9, she is still ha bad seperation anxiety (She is ok go in to school, but otherwise doesn't like to be away from my husband or I), she won't  sleep on her own,  only stopped having a paci a few months ago and still not over not having it, still wears night time diapers and doesn't want to stop wearing them. She was late to toilet train and we finally got her day trained then my husband got sick and the cycle of her wetting herself again started. She will go months without any accidents then there would be weeks of almost daily ones. Lately it is refusing to use public toilets. 

I put it all down to anxiety and my husband  being I'll, but not sure now. She has an appointment  with her Pediatrician on Friday so I will bring it up with him. But, just wondering  if anyone else is familiar with PANDAS or has a child with it? Does it ever go away?","PANDAS - anyone here have a kid diagnosed with this?I'll try to keep this post as short as possible. Eldest daughter, 9 in November has a history of moderate anxiety.

Not tonight. He came out of his room 3 times between 1-1:30 saying he was scared. I then went and lay down in his bed with him. 

We both lay there, he was trying, but just couldn't get back to sleep. For hours. It is now 4am and we are watching Lady and the Tramp and he is clearly up for the day. 

He is supposed to go to school today, and I have to work. The idea of sending him in on less than half of his normal night's sleep is not fun, but the alternative is keeping him home while I work (remote worker, full 8-4 day, including at least 4 hours of meetings as an active participant), and he doesn't nap anymore.

My two oldest are adults and my youngest is seventeen.  My oldest has two children, ages four and two months.  My oldest daughter is struggling financially.  She needs help almost every month, sometimes it's big like help with rent, sometimes it is just having me buy formula or giving her a twenty for gas.  My two days off I have the grandkids so my daughter can work.  She cannot afford day care.  I work around 60+ hours a week though it fluctuates alot.

My youngest daughter is being weirdly (imo) angry about this.  She has a full and active social life and her own car and is not even home that often while the kids are over.  I recently encouraged her to quit her job because while it was fine if she worked five days a week during the summer, they didn't cut her hours back now that school was back in session.  She's a senior in high school and I said three days a week was the max.  I didn't make her, it was something we discussed and agreed it was too much and they refused to cut down her hours.  She paid for her car herself and all summer she contributed to her own insurance.    Her main worry about quitting was whether or not she'd still be able to keep her car without an income.  I told her school was her main job and I would pay the insurance and give her gas money.  Which I have.  We supply all the usual money for clothes, going out to eat or movies or whatever she needs.   

Every penny I give her older sister she gets angry about.  We do not have a lot of money and helping her sister and paying for the insurance takes all our extra but she hasn't gone without anything.  We give her a twenty to pick up dinner or a movie with her friends all the time.  I know there is frustration at the loss of financial freedom, having to ask mom and dad for every dollar, but we hardly ever say no.  

At first this manifested as anger at her sister.  Comments like, ""she shouldn't have had a baby she can't afford"".  Which she's not wrong but the kid is already here.  All we can do is try to work it out.  I didn't reprimand her for this as I felt her feelings were valid even though illogical.  But now her resentment has spread to the kids.  Anything I buy for the grandkids gets snarky comments.  She complains about them all the time.  She wouldn't even hold the baby for two minutes so I could pee saying it wasn't her problem.  She was an amazing aunt to the four year old, taking her to the park, buying her art supplies out of her own money so they could paint together.  Just above and beyond without anyone ever asking her to.  But since the baby and my oldest's financial problems she ignores her or is mean.  My granddaughter worships her and it breaks her little heart.

Please help me identify this blanket!,Parenting,0,db9y90,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/db9y90/please_help_me_identify_this_blanket/,21,1569870573.0," Hi Redditors!

I need help identifying this item:  [https://imgur.com/FwgPX86](https://imgur.com/FwgPX86) 

**Description**: Pink baby blanket in polyester, with decorative sewing in white thread. Decorative eyes on one corner, and an ""appendix"" of the same fabric in the other. This ""appendix"" is the most important part. If you can find a blanket with this part but everything else different, it'll work too!

There are no tags or anything else with text or numbers. Can't remember if it had and was ripped off, or if it never had.

**Size**: 87 cm by 84 cm, or 34 by 33 inches. I can provide more photos and details if needed.

**Backstory**: When my daughter was born, 3 years ago, we received a lot of gifts and free samples. Among them was this baby blanket. She took to it and it is now her comfort item. She sleeps with it every night, she named it and even named the little part that sticks out in one of the corners (what I called the appendix).

Ever since then, I have been looking for this blanket so we can have a replacement if we need to. I reached out to everyone who gifted us presents but no-one remembers gifting this. I believe this may have been a gift that came with some baby related product, but my Google-fu returned nothing useful.

This baby blanket is now showing evident signs of wear and tear, and although it is still in good shape I fear for the day it rips. I know that dealing with loss is part of a child's development, but I would rather my girl chooses to give up her comfort blanket instead of having it break and be left without a choice.

So please, people of Reddit, help me find this pink blanket somewhere where I can purchase it!

If you find a better place for me to post this please let me know.

Can or should anything be done about this?,Parenting,3,db6sv6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/db6sv6/is_studentfaculty_nepotism_an_issue_in_the_united/,5,1569848917.0,"Growing up in a small, Midwest school back in the 80s, it was not uncommon to have students with a parent who was a teacher/principal/coach and sure, most often those kids did very well in both grades and athletics.  I didn't think much of it back then.  I believe it seemed more out of necessity with only a small pool of teachers/coaches in the area.  I simply accepted they had an advantage and that was all.  I didn't want to make waves and they were my friends. 

Now, with my own High School kids/family, living in a large city suburb with well funded school districts (we even have paid Athletic Director Positions!) this seems like such a conflict of interest sending a poor message to our students.  I have seen poor and mediocre at best players not only start, but play practically entire games and be team captains meanwhile losing the game with much more talented, driven and enthusiastic kids spending most time on the bench.  When talking with the other parents, it becomes known; ""That's the Athletic Directors Kid"" or ""Oh, that's Mrs X's son, she is the Varsity Soccer Coach"".  I can tell it strikes a cord and I really don't want to start a rant session, so I don't say anything further unless it is private and with my wife only.  Plus, High School is such a small blip of time.  This might be a good lesson in that life really isn't fair and may help with learning acceptance and how to make the best of things.

In today's far more transparent world though, isn't this easily avoided with a guideline that you can't coach/teach at the same school you have children?","Is student/faculty nepotism an issue in the United States?

She is also able to write 2 or 3 sentences she comes up with by herself and sounding out the words, though she doesn't always spell them right but is pretty close. She also can count to 200 (at least that's the highest I've heard her count) and do basic math. 

Should I wait until the standardized testing or should I start pushing to get her in more advanced stuff now? How should I approach this?

Update: I'm not sure why this is getting down voted? Anyway I really appreciated all the feedback and perspectives, I am going just keep letting her enjoy Kindergarten and not pressure about doing more advanced work. You're only in kindergarten once! Also I will keep up the advanced work at home. She doesn't have homework but she does need to read for 20 minutes every night, but they ask the parents read to kindergarteners for 20 minutes. Being that she can read I'll just have her read 10 minutes and then I will read to her for 10 minutes.","Kindergartener, asking a teacher about advanced classes?Hi!

KND (kid next door) is an only child and has a bit of trouble in social settings. She does however love Miss 6 and they get along fairly well. I do also have an almost 3 year old miss who  loves cuddles and play like most toddlers. KND hates her. She constantly tells her to go away, or screams on top of her lungs whenever miss 3 goes to play with her.

I was not home, hubs actually had a good chat to Miss 6 and explained why her actions were quite mean. 

A few weeks ago, we watched an ep of Bluey (every parent needs to watch this)  and it was pretty much bluey's neighbour not wanting to play with Bingo (bluey's younger sister) so I said to miss 6, this is interesting..its exactly what happens with you and KND.

So cue yesterday..KND comes over..starts the usual..and Miss 6 goes 'you have to include my little sister...she's only two..how would you feel if nobody wanted to play with you? Anyway this is my house and her house..so you have to follow our rules!'

OMG you guys..I was so so proud of her! Hubs and I try not interfere with our kids playing styles unless they are harming one another. We tend to watch and see what type of choices they make. Miss 6 is usually very impressionable and will go along with the pack but she looked out for her sister without being asked and that is such a big proud moment!

It gets very tiring and frustrating because I'm really optimistic but he won't give it a try. How can I motivate my son to give walking a try?

extra info; he's our second child, no issues thank god. he picks up words fine so it's not a mental issue, although he was quite late with crawling. Currently he crawls quite quickly and can also lean on furniture to stand, but can't stand on his own.

Thanks in advance.

EDIT: Thanks for the answers everyone and I appreciate the concerns. For those still wondering (considering the downvotes) I've been seeing doctors normally and most of them told me he's probably just late, especially considering he's mentally fine.

We switched from a charter school to a public school this year so both my kids are new and there was some sort of ‚Äúget to know you‚Äù assignment in my 8 year old‚Äôs class. 

One of the questions was favorite TV show or movie. She said All In The Family. Ok, great. Good show, solid choice. 

So after school her teacher brings me and my husband the project and says my daughter claims to have been watching All in The Family and was I aware of what programs she‚Äôd been taking in. 

I said, you know, ‚Äúsure, we watch it as a family every weekend.‚Äù Thinking that would be that. She said ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs a highly inappropriate show for young children‚Äù and I said ‚ÄúThanks for your concern, but we‚Äôre fine. She isn‚Äôt going behind our backs or anything, we watch it as a family.‚Äù  And the teacher said ‚ÄúWell, I have to tell you, I that‚Äôs questionable judgement on your part.‚Äù 

My husband doesn‚Äôt take very well to that kind of passive condescension so he says ‚ÄúNothing compared to the Eminem music we listen to on the way here‚Äù and I figured I should just end the conversation before it escalated. 

Everyone at the school thinks of us as the ‚Äúnew family‚Äù but I have a few friends whose kids have always gone there and one alerted me that the teacher was essentially gossiping about me while the kids were being dropped off.  I thought it was wildly inappropriate but I figured as long as my daughter enjoys school, I‚Äôd let idle gossip roll of my back.  

I have a friend who‚Äôs a reading specialist at the school and come in a couple times a week and she just informed me that they‚Äôd say these things around my daughter. What my friend overheard was ‚ÄúIf your mommy really cared about you, you wouldn‚Äôt watch that show.‚Äù And in the context of something like running in the halls ‚ÄúI know your mother has no rules or regulations at your house but when you come to school you‚Äôre not the boss like you think you are everywhere else.‚Äù 

My reading specialist friend confronted the teacher because as someone who works with kids she couldn‚Äôt believe what she was hearing. Before she could flat out say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs inappropriate‚Äù she said (this is what she told me was said at least and I‚Äôm paraphrasing from memory) ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôve met CoralMansion Jr and her family?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, they‚Äôre reckless. I tried to help her but she didn‚Äôt want to be helped.‚Äù ‚ÄúI actually know CoralMansion Jr and‚Äî‚Äú ‚Äúoh does she have a learning disability? Go figure the way she rots her brain at home.‚Äù So reading specialist friend said ‚Äúthey‚Äôre good people and happy kids in a home that puts a strong emphasis on education. You‚Äôre barking up the wrong tree and this is not appropriate.‚Äù 

The teacher more or less shrugged it off with an ‚ÄúI know best I‚Äôve worked with kids for X years‚Äù speech. 

I tried to gauge my daughter‚Äôs feelings/awareness of the situation without provoking anything so just kind of offhandedly said ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs Mrs. Newteacher so far?‚Äù And she just said ‚Äúshe‚Äôs kind of grouchy but it‚Äôs still fun.‚Äù And I said you know, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs grouchy about her‚Äù and it sounds like my daughter is just attributing these comments to her teacher being old.

On the one hand, if my daughter‚Äôs ok so am I. On the other hand, it‚Äôs still early in the year and if there‚Äôs a chance this escalated into a bigger issue, I want to act now before we‚Äôre halfway through the year and it‚Äôs harder to initiate a conversation.","Teacher badmouthing my parenting to my 8 year oldMy kids teacher has been badmouthing me to other parents and now my own daughter and I‚Äôm totally at a loss as to what I should do.

Potty training - need help!,Parenting,5,db12ho,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/db12ho/potty_training_need_help/,22,1569819214.0,"Hi everyone, need your help desperately. My child is 3.5 years old. Back around when he was 3 we did a 3 day straight potty training with underwear during the day and pullups for nighttime. It went so well. He was telling us when he needed to go to the toilet and it was just so simple. At daycare, they only did pullups. They did not do underwear like we did. Slowly he started to have more and more accidents until he stopped telling us he needed to go and to the point he was fighting to go to the toilet. It got so frustrating that we decided to take about 1-2 months off so he didn't feel so pressured. Yesterday we started potty training again and it's a fight most of the time. He did have a few successes and today we were at a fair and he was able to hold it in for 2 hours at a time with no accidents. We got home and he went for a nap and no accidents during his nap. After nap, I asked him to go on the toilet, he refused . I told him please tell us if you need to go...he promised. About 10 mins later, he looks at me, hides behind a door and pees in his pants. It seems to me he chooses to pee or poop in his pants. We have a jar of chocolate M&M as a rewards and sometimes it works. Any tips and suggested/feedback you can give us. We need help!

How do you handle your kid always looking for more in life?,Parenting,3,db2455,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/db2455/how_do_you_handle_your_kid_always_looking_for/,34,1569823990.0,"Hi all. I have two kids. One is six and a half, the other just over one. We do what we can in life to give our kids lots of enriching experiences. Not a weekend passes that we don‚Äôt go somewhere and do something. 

This makes me happy, I like to get out and I like the kids to get out too. Home is where we spend the bulk of the work week without being able to get out as much. Maybe a library trip weekly during the weekdays and one or twice a month a bonus trip to a children‚Äôs museum. With the baby it‚Äôs hard to get out with both kids by myself so these bigger outings usually wait for dad to be here too.

My six year old seems never satisfied. We will be doing an activity or on an outing and she is already planning the next thing she wants to do or lamenting something we didn‚Äôt get to do today. 

It makes it really hard for us to feel good about what we offer in life. Yesterday we went to a farmers market. It had a safety show going on. My daughter got to sit in a helicopter, use a bounce house, go in a fire truck. We bought cake and cookies and sat for a picnic snack. She lamented that she liked the usual farmers market better, because...? No reasons.

Today we went to the local park and walked a nature trail. We saw beautiful flowers and even a snake in a tree. It was cool and shady and so nice. We walked past the horse riding area. She asked if we were riding today, I said no, is expensive and we aren‚Äôt prepared for it. Cue the awwwwww whyyyyyyy and the beauty around her is forgotten.

We go from the trail to the play ground and she will only discuss how she likes the OTHER play ground better. We drive past the closed down splash park and she asks to go, I say it‚Äôs over for the year, she says an infuriating ‚Äúwe never get to do anything fun.‚Äù

We go to a restaurant for lunch, she gets the meal of her choice plus the lions share of onion rings she loves. She laments that we don‚Äôt get dessert. We go to the dollar store, I let her get a junky horse toy. She laments that we don‚Äôt get candy.

And that‚Äôs just this weekend but that is the general tone she lives with. Ungrateful for what is happening, expectant of more and better, impossible to impress it seems.

So short of forcing her to live in an empty box for three months so she gains perspective and appreciation for what happens in life, how do you handle this? We don‚Äôt want to punish ourselves or the baby either by not doing things because the big one is an ingrate.

I‚Äôve been using the new Daniel tiger jingle ‚Äúenjoy the wow that‚Äôs happening now‚Äù when it feels appropriate but that just cues an eye roll and no real impact on her behavior. Conversations about how we have a nice life compared to others and she should be appreciative just zoom overhead. YouTube videos and books on homeless kids and poverty stricken families interest her but don‚Äôt get relayed back in a sense of wow I‚Äôve got it okay.","How do you handle your kid always looking for more in life?Hi all.

I called my therapist office today. I have been in 3 years so they want to treat me like a new patient. First available new pt appt is in December. I was able to call my Primary care physician and she wrote me a new script for anxiety meds. She put me me back on what I was on a few years ago to help me get to the therapist where I can make a plan of action.  I also talked to my family about being supportive to a fault. It's awesome they think I'm super girl and can handle anything but the reality is I'm not.


Sorry if this is rambling. It might be a bit eating disorder triggering just a heads up. I am having a very bad week and I'm not sure I'll have the strength to read the replies tonight. I will probably read them in the morning. This is part vent part begging for advice.

When I was a child we were very food insecure. Probably from age five or six until I was almost twenty. It led to a habbit of binge eating. We ate when there was food and didn't when there wasn't. At the worst I would only eat every few days and then I'd dramatically over eat. I've been to therapy but since my weight has never swing dramatically to either side I was told to keep it in check and log my food and if it gets worse we can address it but it's always been a back burner issue. This combined with family members shaming me for not being dainty feminine enough (I am 5'9"" I will never be dainty) means I have a very unhealthy relationship with food and body image. 

Now I have 2 kids. I was so relieved when my son was born and it gave me false hope that I had moved on from the worst of my issues. Then my daughter was born. It started like a hum you don't hear until someone points it out. She had to go in for a weight check at 2 weeks old because she wasn't gaining enough and the nurse said she may just be dainty. Some girls are like that. And I was so happy. Then by her 6 mo check up she was average 50% height and weight and I started to worry. What if my baby was fat. What if I screwed her up and she ended up like me? Then just before her 9 mo check up I went to drop her off at the drop in care at the gym and the woman who watches her picked her up and said she's such a little chunk. I know she didn't mean anything by it but my heart dropped and I can't unhear it. 

At her 9 mo check up she was almost 70% for height and 60 for weight and the pediatrician said it was starting to look like she would be tall like her mama and it killed me. My biggest fear in life is my kids will be too much like me. That I will somehow give her my bad body image, my depression, my anxeity, my struggle with healthy eating. I don't want that to be my legacy for my kids. 

My son is in food therapy due to severe food aversions. It was so bad at one point that if he touched certain food textures like yogurt he would throw up. I feel like this is my fault that somehow I managed to cause this. Per his therapist it doesn't work like that but they also can't tell me what happened. We try so hard to keep everyone in the house eating consistent healthy meals and it feels like I am failing at every turn and I'm scared my kids will be like me and no amount of therapy or meal prep will stop the cycle from repeating. I don't want my kids to grow up hating themselves and insecure in their own skin. 

Even now my son is in dance because he loves it and parents think he shouldn't be there because he's a boy. I see those little girls in full makeup and bows and I am worried my daughter can never be one because she will be too big and they will pick on her. 

I guess I just need advice. I am feeling very lost today and have more stress than I can handle.","My daughter is 9 mo old and I'm not sure I'm cut out to raise a girlEDIT: I just wanted to say thank you to everyone for all the in-depth advice.

This combined with family members shaming me for not being dainty feminine enough (I am 5'9"" I will never be dainty) means I have a very unhealthy relationship with food and body image. 

Now I have 2 kids. I was so relieved when my son was born and it gave me false hope that I had moved on from the worst of my issues. Then my daughter was born. It started like a hum you don't hear until someone points it out. She had to go in for a weight check at 2 weeks old because she wasn't gaining enough and the nurse said she may just be dainty. Some girls are like that. And I was so happy. Then by her 6 mo check up she was average 50% height and weight and I started to worry. What if my baby was fat. What if I screwed her up and she ended up like me? Then just before her 9 mo check up I went to drop her off at the drop in care at the gym and the woman who watches her picked her up and said she's such a little chunk. I know she didn't mean anything by it but my heart dropped and I can't unhear it. 

At her 9 mo check up she was almost 70% for height and 60 for weight and the pediatrician said it was starting to look like she would be tall like her mama and it killed me. My biggest fear in life is my kids will be too much like me. That I will somehow give her my bad body image, my depression, my anxeity, my struggle with healthy eating. I don't want that to be my legacy for my kids. 

My son is in food therapy due to severe food aversions. It was so bad at one point that if he touched certain food textures like yogurt he would throw up. I feel like this is my fault that somehow I managed to cause this. Per his therapist it doesn't work like that but they also can't tell me what happened. We try so hard to keep everyone in the house eating consistent healthy meals and it feels like I am failing at every turn and I'm scared my kids will be like me and no amount of therapy or meal prep will stop the cycle from repeating. I don't want my kids to grow up hating themselves and insecure in their own skin. 

Even now my son is in dance because he loves it and parents think he shouldn't be there because he's a boy. I see those little girls in full makeup and bows and I am worried my daughter can never be one because she will be too big and they will pick on her. 

I guess I just need advice. I am feeling very lost today and have more stress than I can handle."

She can roar for up to an hour (no tears) standing up in the cot until I usually give in because I feel guilty about my husband being tired for work or her waking the other kids. Going in to lie her back down just seems to make her more angry.

She goes to sleep at 7.30pm and has 2x90min naps a day. Both myself and her dad went in several times to try to settle her but she just wasn't having it.

Our 9 (almost 10) months old son is constantly waking up at night. Like 3-5 times. He is not even waking up completely but he just sits and cries/shouts with closed eyes. When we put him back to lying position he immediately falls asleep again.

We did lots of mistakes. When he was born we had really tiny apartment and it was our first baby so we co-slept with him in a cosleeper. Now he is in his own bed but close to ours and wakes up constantly. Not sure what to do. Pediatrician said he needs to learn how to sooth himself, but how long can it take? He has been teething for awhile, but currently I think it stopped (already has 6 teeth‚Äôs).

During the day its a nightmare to put him to sleep. It can take an hour to put him to sleep so that he sleeps like 30mins. 2 naps is total MAX. Last nap usually around 2pm.

Any suggestions?","9months old waking up at nightHey!

She is SO not ready for the freedom a toddler bed would give her. I can see it now. Running around all night. Banging on the door. Crying for us to come get her. And eventually passing out on the floor. Waking up multiple times because she's uncomfortable sleeping on hardwood. 

Pediatrician said nothing is safe to cover her crib like a crib tent so that's out. Large door cages are frowned upon. Lol

What about her baby monitor? The outlet is a foot off the ground. She could play with the cord all night if she's unsupervised. What to do?","Toddler climbed out of crib.

My husband and I do well parenting out two young children together, I'd say, 80% of the time. (as long as he is having a good day)...
My husband changes diapers, kisses booboos, cooks dinner sometimes lol, tucks them in when I cant, plays all the best games with them, etc. HOWEVER, if he decides he is having a bad day, or suddenly for some unrelated reason, decides he is in a bad mood.. he lashes out on the kids for any tiny thing they do. (Even if they play too loud they may get in big trouble.) 

He will stomp as he walks through the house towards them, and YELL louder than a siren until his veins pop out of his head and neck.  He will terrorize them with his intimidating persona...(military vet - really shines through)... and I always step infront of the kids in those moments, or tell him to stop!! But that makes it WAAAYYYY worse, and he will turn his aggression towards all three of us that much more.  

And within moments, he is back to normal, and wants to take the kids to the park etc.. but doesnt understand why we are all in a different mood. (Because the kids & I are in shock and traumatized).. if we don't ""give him another chance"" he is prone to get upset all over again, so it's hard.

This happens maybe 2 times a month now.. it used to happen ALLLLLL THE TIME. But he is ""trying"" to get better.  He refuses counseling, medication, etc etc..  so it's hard for me to suggest anything that will help his level of mood swings.

Our kids are young.  About to turn 2 and 6.  This morning the little one wasn't feeling well (has been fighting a tough cold for a few days) so our son was vocal this morning.. moaning and groaning, being miserable.  My husband started stomping from our room upstairs, down the hallway, and down the stairs, SO LOUDLY, that my toddler started to practically hyperventilate in absolute fear!

Causing him to cry that much worse. I shouted, ""he didnt do anything!!! He just doesnt feel well!!"" And my husband said, ""he was being too loud.. he did everything.  Now shut up and go in the bathroom.""

We do not see eye to eye on his obscurely strict was of reprimanding children (of any age) but especially when they are as young as ours are now!!

I'm on my very very very last straw.  Should I divorce this guy yet, give him an ultimatum, leave for my moms for awhile, what...?

Because he is absolutely perfect all the rest of the time!! Seriously a delight to be around.  But these rare blow ups, are enough to cause me to second guess who I chose to raise children with.

We do not see eye to eye on his obscurely strict was of reprimanding children (of any age) but especially when they are as young as ours are now!!

I'm on my very very very last straw.  Should I divorce this guy yet, give him an ultimatum, leave for my moms for awhile, what...?

Because he is absolutely perfect all the rest of the time!! Seriously a delight to be around.  But these rare blow ups, are enough to cause me to second guess who I chose to raise children with.  I'm embarrassed.. and I feel so sorry for my kids.. I need something to change, what do I do?"

Any stay-at-home parents of older kids here? Do you feel judged or do you have fears of your future?,Parenting,835,daf7dm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/daf7dm/any_stayathome_parents_of_older_kids_here_do_you/,324,1569701603.0,"I became a stay at home mom when my kids were born nine and ten years ago. I'd always thought that I would return to work once my kids were school age. Actually, I was desperate to return to work and feel like a normal adult, doing normal adult stuff around other working adults. I thought things would be so much easier now that my kids had turned 9 & 10 years old. But that was not the case. 

Before I started working, the house was always clean, the laundry always done and put away, the fridge always full of food, meals were always cooked in the house, kids had packed lunches everyday, and financing was in order with bills always paid on time. If kids got sick at school, it was no big deal because I could swoop in and within 5 minutes pick them up. If the kids wanted me to volunteer at one of their school activities, I was always there. Life had a rhythm that our household had gotten used to.

After getting hired full time, I hated it! Things became crazy around the house. Everything turned to shit. I was struggling and stressed trying to keep up with everything. We started getting fast food and take out often because I was not always up to grocery shopping and cooking. The laundry pile was now a permanent thing because I just couldn't keep up with it. Every morning we were digging in the pile of wrinkly clothes trying to find something to wear. Within my first week of work my daughter had gotten sick at school. It was difficult for me to leave work early because I had just started a few days prior and my husband has a really high demanding job, which also makes it difficult for him.

It quickly became clear, working outside the house for me was just not worth it and I quit. I was only earning $12/hour which was not a big loss for us because my husband makes exponentially a lot more.

However, not working comes with its own set of anxieties and judgments at this stage of parenting. What will I do when my kids graduate high-school, will I be employable after not working for so long? When I speak with other parents who also have older kids I could feel their judgment by the questions they ask. I live in a blue collar neighborhood where it is common for both parents to work to maintain the household. Some parents cannot understand why I wouldn't work since my kids are older. Me and my husband have always made the choice to live bellow our means with a smaller and affordable house in order to have some financial freedom.

It has gotten to a point that I am embarrassed to say that I am a stay at home mom to older kids. My family has made comments to me about ""living the good life"" and not working. I hate the judgment and it makes me stay away. I would love to hear from other stay at home parents.

And one last thing, I have to say is that I have mad respect for working parents.","Any stay-at-home parents of older kids here?

I bought like 10 pieces of clothing for less than $50! I think I could've done better if I had planned better. 

So for those experienced consignment shoppers out there, what is your shopping strategy? Do you buy multiple sizes of clothing at one sale, or do you buy the next 1-2 sizes up until next year's sale? What types of items or brands/fabric types do you normally aim for? What do you NOT buy at a consignment sale? Any other helpful tips or advice is much appreciated!!

Need help talking to my child's psychologist.

Yesterday, I caught my step daughter (12) trying to drown our cat. The day before, she got suspended from school for assaulting a teacher and running out of school and disappearing for several hours. These incidents are extremely out of character for her but the scariest thing and my biggest concern  is that after these two incidences, she showed absolutely no remorse, fear or even offered her usual banter, she also has oppositional disorder. 

Earlier in the week, we had an appt with her psychiatrist, who also schedules therapy sessions s with a psychologist. We went in with the intention of asking for more therapy sessions instead of this continual experimentation with different pills which had been going on for the last three years.

I work in the field of early childhood education and am required to take continuing education on subjects such a early childhood development, understanding trauma and etc. From what I have learned from these courses and observing her for 3 years is that she was never given the opportunity to develop basic cognitive and socio-emotional skills. She had an extremely dysfunctional early life and has seen and experienced traumatic events due to her mother's drug addiction.

Basically, the doctor was combative and condescending and said that she really needs the pills. She then prescribed Zoloft at a higher dose than usual which was to be taken immediately. Now, I know and completely understand that antidepressants may take up to several weeks to kick in but in my step daughter's case it kicked in the next day. Zoloft is an SSRI and it works by increasing serotonin the ""the happiness chemical"" in the brain. I'm afraid that because she has an excess of serotonin, she is not able to process feelings such as guilt and sadness and pain. 

This is exactly what we did not want to happen, we wanted her to develop these skills. She is not incapable of showing empathy, I have worked with her throughout the years and she has shown improvement but with these pills, she has completely lost everything we have been working so hard for. 

I need help relaying this information to her psychiatrist so that she will understand our concerns instead of shutting us down immediately just because we don't have a high degree in mental health.

TL;DR: recovering drug addict enjoyed a night relaxing with my toddler

She just fell asleep, curled up between me and the couch, head on my arm. We are sleeping on two stacked mattresses in the living room because it's still getting to 80¬∞ here in Pennsylvania and its cooler downstairs. I just looked over at her peaceful sleeping and was momentarily captivated by her beauty in the glow of the TV, which has Frasier playing quietly. 

I'm a recovering drug addict with 18 days clean. I have a baby addiction compared to most addicts but it really took over my life. I was using stimulants like adderall to keep me going so I could keep up with being a CNA, and a mom, and a housekeeper, and a cook... alone. I have no support in any capacity for her. I thought it made me a better parent but it made me an absent parent even though I was still in the home because of the many nights I couldn't sleep and my two year old went to bed by herself.

Past week or so I've been really nauseous, and I get tired easily anyway but especially since my stomach hurts and I have no appetite. Today my eldest child was here overnight and trying to be attentive to both of them and fair to both of them wears me out so when she went back to her dad's, my youngest took a nap and I dozed for a few minutes but then got up and started cleaning up the black hole that is our house. When my LO woke up, I gave up on the cleaning and took her for a walk using the new-to-us walker/tricycle thing I found on the side of the road. When we got back, I'd used up all my energy, and my stomach hurt, so I threw tater tots in the oven for supper and we spent the evening just lying in bed, watching *Svengoolie* for me, and YouTube videos for her, giggling and being silly. Munching on dry Mini Wheats for dessert. At one point, we got up to get fresh drinks and were trying to sort of the tricycle because the front wheel turns sideways, and I got into the seat and she pushed me with the handle which was like, a foot above her head. I couldn't believe she was able to push me. We laughed and laughed. It's been a really nice, relaxing night at home, sober.

Since I'm in intensive outpatient treatment to address my drug addiction, I dont have time to work. I only have childcare during the day on weekdays and I do IOP every morning until 12, then its back to back appointments till it's time to get home and pick her up and start supper to start again the next day. Money is a big stressor for me; my electric was shut off Thursday for non payment, and I've resorted more than once to shoplifting the basic necessities (like coffee and baby wipes) as well as demeaned myself by begging neighbors for money for diapers. My phone is off right now because I dont have $40 to pay for the service, using another neighbor's wifi at the moment. I carry a lot of guilt and shame about the complete failure I am as a 29 year old person, and as a mother.

But tonight I was able to forget all my shit. My phone is off so no one could get ahold of me. My stomach hurts so I let myself rest for once (I have it in my head that being tired from not using drugs is no excuse not to attend to my responsibilities) and I just relaxed and just enjoy spending time with my kid. And we didnt do anything. we didn't even have a real dinner. She didnt care; she just enjoyed spending time together.

I really needed this, you guys, I really did. It's the stuff you don't realize you're missing when you're using. I'm glad she is young enough not to remember the dark times and I will do everything I can to make sure she doesn't make any new memories where I let her down because I chose drugs.","I've been dealing with a lot of shit and right now I'm just overwhelmed with the love I have for my two year old

She also suffers from medicated bipolar and goes into long bouts of depression where she doesnt want to do anything. 

My sister baby sits one day a week and mom goes over to the house with her. Mom doesnt have a car either. She rarely stays the whole time and will uber home after half of a 5 hour visit, or will uber there sometimes after a few hours. Long story short,  I dont want to leave the baby with her and I get tons of backlash from her for it. Multiple very long texts saying shes ashamed of me because I wont leave my daughter alone with her. Also, that I'm hurting her feelings, that it cuts so deep. I love my mother, but this is getting hard to handle. Has anyone else go through anything like this? How did you handle it? Let me know."

I have a 17 month old and he's recently had some issues with his sleep schedule because he goes back and forth between our house and my moms. We use crying it out at my house but at my moms he sleeps with someone then gets put into his bed. That's what caused this disagreement tonight. My bf thinks that he has been throwing a fit to get up and that me taking him to our room to try and fall asleep or letting him play for a couple more hours (even though we are tired) is letting him get his way. I believe that he is too young and he just doesnt understand so we should just wait till he's getting closer to being sleepy to put him to bed. ( Neither of us have to be up at any certain time so sleep schedules are usually flexible at my house.) My bf has said this before with him crying over something and after a few of trying I let him get his way. Who's in the wrong? Also. What age is it okay to let him cry for longer periods if he's not getting what he wants for other things than sleeping? With sleeping i let him cry untill I feel like it has been long enough. Then I go in there and tell him goodnight then leave and if he cries again i let him cry a little longer. If he does this too many times or starts to scream I check his diaper and his bed for anything that could be bothering him and then if i see nothing I bring him out to the living room to play. Tonight I've tried letting him sleep with me, watch tv, and he's currently playing with his toys no signs of being tired...","Is he in the wrong or am I?I posted this in r/askparents bit I think I should have posted here first..

Why I'm a helicopter parent,Parenting,3,daq9t1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/daq9t1/why_im_a_helicopter_parent/,16,1569757953.0,"My 4 year old son has autism and sensory processing disorder. Because of this, he faces a lot of challenges other kids don't face. Perhaps one of his biggest challenges is his constant easily-triggered meltdowns. He doesn't have these meltdowns to be defiant, bratty, or to get attention. He has them because of things he cannot control, like a certain sound or scent that he just cannot stand. Unfortunately, most people (even professionals who were trained to work with special needs kids) don't understand this, so they deal with his meltdowns like tantrums. Even his occupational therapist has done this occasionally. Due to these discipline techniques, he often acts worse than before he was disciplined. He gets deeply hurt by these discipline techniques and can perseverate on them for days and even weeks after the event. Because of this, I have to keep a close eye on him during these situations and be actively involved in the activity, which means me volunteering in every activity he belongs to, or, if no volunteers are needed, sitting in on his activities. This has led to me being disparagingly called a ""helicopter parent"" by other parents and sometimes even the group leaders. The people who call me a helicopter parent as an insult just don't understand the reason why I'm doing this. For example, if your child had an allergic reaction, and nobody understood how to properly attend to your child's allergic reaction, wouldn't you sit in on your child's activities? This is basically the same situation. So, next time you want to insult a parent, whose child has special needs and as a result watches him more, by calling them a helicopter parent, think about the reason why they're being a helicopter parent. We have to deal with so much, so instead of insulting us, why not try lifting us up?","Why I'm a helicopter parentMy 4 year old son has autism and sensory processing disorder.

Advice on getting 8 year old to wear a jacket,Parenting,1,dat54o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dat54o/advice_on_getting_8_year_old_to_wear_a_jacket/,6,1569779163.0,"Getting my 8 year old daughter to bundle up when it's cold outside has been a constant battle for as long as I can remember. For the record, we live above the arctic circle and during the past few weeks, the temperatures have already started to drop below 0¬∞C (32¬∞F). And yet my 8 year old will insist on wearing T-shirts and sleeveless tank tops when going outside, and throw a fit when I try to get her to at least wear a light fleece jacket. She always argues that she's not cold, that she gets way too hot with a jacket on and that just because I think it's cold outside doesn't mean she thinks so too.

I've tried buying her lighter, more comfortable coats that don't weigh heavy on her or restrict her movement. I've tried taking her to the store and telling her she could pick whatever jacket she wanted, so long as she'd promise to wear it. I've tried taking away privileges. Nothing worked. At most, she'll wear a coat for the first few seconds after leaving the house to go to school, while I can still see her out the window, and take it off as soon as she's out of my sight. She commutes to school by public transport every day, so I can't control whether or not she wears a coat during this period of time. On the rare occasion that she does wear a jacket though, she overheats within minutes and sweats through all her clothes. 

I know for a fact that it's not a thyroid problem causing this, because I took her to several doctors when she was younger and had her checked for that. She was however diagnosed with mild tachycardia a few years ago, a heart rhythm disorder that means she's got an elevated heart rate, but I've been told that it's nothing to worry too much about. I'm not sure if an elevated heart rate could be causing her to overheat even in the coldest of temperatures, though.

Do any of your kids refuse to wear a coat or jacket at all costs, even in sub-zero temperatures? Is this just stubbornness, a higher cold tolerance or something I should be more concerned about?","Advice on getting 8 year old to wear a jacketGetting my 8 year old daughter to bundle up when it's cold outside has been a constant battle for as long as I can remember.

Terrifying moment last night,Parenting,0,dauhms,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dauhms/terrifying_moment_last_night/,9,1569788843.0,"So last night we went to my husbands sister for a fundraising event.  The backyard was huge with lots of room for three bouncy houses, tables to sit and still more room to run around.  The yard was surrounded by woods on three sides.  The front yard was a decent size as well and the driveway was like a wooded path to the street that was a decent size from the back yard.

Okay, so my youngest is 21 months and was running and playing by myself in the backyard with a soccer ball.  I was sitting with my in-laws and watching out for him most of the time.  Then I saw him go play with his dad by the DJ table.  I went to ride the mechanical bull with my in-laws and was over there for a max of 10 minutes.  When I turned around the baby wasn‚Äôt near his dad, or playing by the table with the soccer balls or in the bouncy houses.  At this point I was freaking out and asked my husband had he seen where he went.  So now we‚Äôre both searching all over the back yard and his sisters and nieces start searching the front yard and the woods.  I am searching and freakin out and then my niece sees him ON THE ROAD!  He walks from the middle yellow lines back to the driveway, but just the edge.  My SIL sprints down and grabs him before he goes back on the road.  My heart is just beating horrified.

I couldn‚Äôt help but play all the worst cases that could have happened.  Being hit by a car on the road, or if someone would have shown up right then for the fundraiser and would never have seen him.  I followed him the rest of the night everywhere he went because I couldn‚Äôt relax for even a minute.  Even all night I dreamt of it and every time I closed my eyes I saw him there on the road.

He has never Run to the road before, never strayed more than a few yards from us, and the road was quite a distance from where everyone was.  

Even though I had been vigilant the entire night, saw him with his dad right before I went to ride the mechanical bull, it‚Äôs all it took for him to disappear.  

We were very lucky last night and I am so thankful I didn‚Äôt spend more time relaxing or just assume he was with the older kids, I am so thankful my SIL was looking in the front and sprinted to my son, and so thankful no cars went by at that instance he was there.  My life as I knew it almost ended last night.   We were surrounded by so many family and she just snuck by everyone.  

It only takes a minute.

My son, who I love so very much, was getting in trouble for biting in day care. We felt awful bc it was happening often and we had no clue how to fix it so we took him out. Around that time, we noticed a speech delay. Fast forward to now, he was diagnosed (by education system) with autism. He is now 3.2 years old and attends a pre k, speech and occupational therapy, and is doing well. He is talking more but no where near where his peers are. It‚Äôs mostly babble that only we can understand.

While I‚Äôm not sure I agree with the diagnosis sometimes, I‚Äôve absolutely accepted it. He‚Äôs my child so I just want techniques that work to HELP HIM. He doesn‚Äôt listen or communicate to instructions very well at all. If we tell him no he can‚Äôt have a cupcake, he will try every which way possible to evade us and get it. When we say no again, he freaks out. He then goes to other ppl to get it and then I have to say no and then he starts screaming. He does this often and he just doesn‚Äôt understand. I get normal toddler things, but this is almost if we say no or any form of no, it‚Äôs a yell or cry type event. If we pass target or sonic, he gets upset bc he doesn‚Äôt get to go in or get a large cup of water. It‚Äôs like we can‚Äôt do anything without ticking him off.

When we try to teach him- he is very hyperactive (Literally NEVER sits still) and when we say try to concentrate, try to pee on the potty, etc just to get him to try to learn it ends up a struggle. I am at my wits end. Is there any advice or hope? We have tried the stay calm constantly route, the ENOUGH look route, the try not to say no to things but instead defer route, try to teach him.

He doesn‚Äôt listen or communicate to instructions very well at all. If we tell him no he can‚Äôt have a cupcake, he will try every which way possible to evade us and get it. When we say no again, he freaks out. He then goes to other ppl to get it and then I have to say no and then he starts screaming. He does this often and he just doesn‚Äôt understand. I get normal toddler things, but this is almost if we say no or any form of no, it‚Äôs a yell or cry type event. If we pass target or sonic, he gets upset bc he doesn‚Äôt get to go in or get a large cup of water. It‚Äôs like we can‚Äôt do anything without ticking him off.

When we try to teach him- he is very hyperactive (Literally NEVER sits still) and when we say try to concentrate, try to pee on the potty, etc just to get him to try to learn it ends up a struggle. I am at my wits end. Is there any advice or hope? We have tried the stay calm constantly route, the ENOUGH look route, the try not to say no to things but instead defer route, try to teach him. I just don‚Äôt know if I am a bad parent who can‚Äôt teach his kid or if my kid just can‚Äôt communicate so he acts like this... he is a great kid but this issue and non communication is so damn tough."

1.

Next morning there is trash EVERYWHERE in our yard from raccoons/dogs(?) and it‚Äôs the trash I had sent her out with the night before 

2. Asked her what she had for lunch at school. Told me she had food from a local restaurant and when I called her out about lying she responds with she ‚Äújust felt like‚Äù lying.

3. Asked her to help me hang up jeans to dry. She took them, came back and said she hung them perfectly. Go to get a pair the next morning and she threw them all on the floor. 

4.

She‚Äôs always been a high achiever, straight A‚Äôs (the report card she brought home yesterday had her lowest grade as a 95), goes way above and beyond for all school assignments, seriously a good kid (NO idea where she got it from, my husband and I were not the smartest or most well behaved). Marching is a whole new ball of wax for her though and she‚Äôs struggling hard. They have practice 4 days a week after school, and usually about 2 hours of homework.

My daughter wants to have a sleepover -- the mother of the friend she's invited has informed me of her daughter displaying inappropriate sexual behavior. What do I do?,Parenting,32,dadlga,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dadlga/my_daughter_wants_to_have_a_sleepover_the_mother/,48,1569689663.0,"I'll preface this by saying that my child is 7 years old and in 2nd grade, so these are prepubescent children to which I'm referring. 

My daughter, we'll call her E has a friend we'll call B. B first came to my daughter's school last year, and their relationship started off rough. B bullied E, physically and emotionally. There were instances when both me and B's mother were called to the principal's office (separately) to discuss ongoing problems between the girls. On one such occassion B backed E into a corner, called her a b**ch, and hit her in the face. Another time B pushed E down on the playground when E refused to give her the bracelet she was wearing, and there were a few instances of the same ongoing behavior toward other kids as well. At one point B was on the verge of being kicked out of the school, as she has been from her previous one. 

E is a very loving and forgiving kind of kid -- it's one of the things I love most about her -- so over time the bullying stopped and E has left it in the past. This all happened last school year.

Flash forward to the present. E and B have became ""sort of"" friends (that's what E calls it when we've talked about their relationship). Apparently B is temperamental and is prone to outbursts, and when she acts that way, E just leaves her alone and plays with her other friends. Over time, B's mom (we'll call her A) and I have spoken several times. I wouldn't call us friends, and our conversations have been strictly about the girls, but we have each other's phone numbers and she has added me on Facebook. During one of the several conversations we've had, A divulged some of B's background to help me understand why she sometimes acts the way she does. Apparently A is bipolar, and although it has not been officially diagnosed (because of B's age), A has been told by her physician that B  has the same disorder. That brought a lot of B's behavior into perspective, and it makes sense. That's not the issue, as everyone is fighting their own battles, but it is relevant to the current dilemma. 

During the above mentioned conversation, A also told me that there were a few things that I ""needed to watch out for should B ever come to our house."" The outbursts were one thing, her sexual behavior was another. A went on to tell me that B had been caught several times masturbating. Not privately, but rather in plain view, like while sitting on the couch watching TV, or hiding behind a chair in the living room. I understand children are curious by nature, so I asked if it was more like her exploring her body, and she told me no, that B would masturbate ""to completion"" and when asked why (A was afraid B had been molested) B told her that she hadn't been,  that she'd just ""figured it out and it felt good."" Not wanting B to feel ashamed for the action, A told her that what she was doing was natural, but that it was something you did in private away from other people. 

The situation was resolved, and there were no further incidents until a few months down the road. A walked in on B touching her younger sister (who was less than a 1 year old at the time) beneath her diaper which led to a conversation as to why it was wrong. B told A that she just wanted her sister to ""feel good like she did when she touched herself."" Supposedly they worked things out and there haven't been anymore situations like that as far as she knows, but that's not to say that there won't be in the future.

I was molested by an older cousin when I was young, so this is a very sensitive topic for me. I've always done everything in my power to make sure my children were not put in situations like that, but I feel by allowing B into my home I'm putting not only E at risk, but also her brothers and sisters as well. 

I don't know what to do. The obvious answer is to monitor them closely, but with 5 kids in the house (the number of children my husband and I have) that's not always feasible. Kids can get out of your sight easily, and not only that, but these aren't babies we're talking about... They're going to want to jump on the trampoline outside or play in the bedroom with toys. 

My daughter has asked repeatedly for B to come over, but the possibility of things going wrong terrifies me so I've made excuses and put it off. That's only going to last so long though...

Need tact advice,Parenting,5,dajw49,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dajw49/need_tact_advice/,11,1569724503.0,"I'm going to start by saying that I'm pretty sure my mother has BPD. Not officially diagnosed, but textbook case.

She and my 20-month-old son are really close which is great, but my concern is how she talks to my Dad. She degrades him, snaps at him, belittles him, nitpicks at him, and tells him to shut up... A LOT.

I've given up trying to resolve this in a general sense; if anyone challenges her negative behaviours she will turn on the tears, accuse them of picking on her, revert to ""I had a tough childhood, my Dad made me feel stupid, I don't need it from you too"", then go into histrionics about how she's in the way and gets everything wrong and we'd all be happier if she wasn't around to make our lives miserable... Like I said, textbook BPD.

Anyway, I do have concerns about her influence on my son. He adores her so he wants to copy her. In many ways this is helpful and he's learned a lot of positive things because of her, but I'm worried about him hearing how she talks to Dad and thinking it's normal to degrade and bully people that way.

I broached it with her tonight by asking her to think about how she talks to my son in front of Dad, and why. I asked her to listen to herself speak and ask ""would I like to be spoken to that way?""

And sure enough, histrionics and ""I don't have a lot of confidence right now, why does everyone feel the need to make me feel worse?"", etc. Then drama about ""everyone cuts me off all the time but nobody cares about that!"" (She's an incessant talker and interrupting her monologues about TV, Facebook, op shops, etc is the only way to get a word in if we have to discuss something important. If she's not the only one talking she claims that nobody will let her speak).

I don't want to stop her spending time with my son because he absolutely adores her, and I don't want to say that they can't have him there if they're both there because Dad would never get to see him (she's convinced he's going to cheat on her if he talks to anyone - even me - without her present!), but there has got to be a way to handle this so that she stops bullying and belittling Dad (who my son is also close to) in front of him.

My kids (7 yo daughter, 6 yo son, and 22 month old son) were just outside and my 22 month old picked up a pile of acorns and was collecting them in a container. When my other 2 kids seen him doing it, they each wanted their own container to put theirs in as well. They spent a good while picking them up and collecting them and I would hate to just throw them away or throw them back out on the ground. Does anyone have any ideas on what we could do with them? 

Thanks in advance if anyone comments!","Ideas on what to do with acornsNot sure if I should post this here or on a craft sub. If I should post somewhere else please let me know. Thanks!

Tips needed on potty training our first child with needs,Parenting,6,dagyyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dagyyg/tips_needed_on_potty_training_our_first_child/,4,1569711135.0,"Hello, there's a reddit for everything so I've come here asking for tips potty training my son who is 3 years old, has global development delay, he doesn't speak yet and doesn't follow orders all the time. He says some words but doesn't string them together. He has started to take his own nappy off after doing a poo and tries wiping his own bottom but sometimes makes a mess doing it so his noticing he's been but it's getting him to use the special seat that goes on top of our toilet. We have tried putting his poo down our toilet to show him where it goes but he ends up throwing his nappy down there. We want to try to get him to sit on the toilet when he needs to go. He hides when he needs to go, he stands behind the sofa. So he knows when he needs to go we just can't catch him before he needs to poo. Any tips from parents that have been through this would be great and what best methods worked for you.

Tonight's a milestone and it's nerve wracking,Parenting,746,d9z9n6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/d9z9n6/tonights_a_milestone_and_its_nerve_wracking/,149,1569613826.0,"My daughter (13) is going on her first date. They're going to his school's homecoming game. He got her a necklace yesterday and gave her his school hoodie (aww). His parents are going along with them and I trust my daughter's judgement and he seems like a sweet boy. And I know that with them being 13 it's going to be entirely innocent. Maybe hand-holding and hugs. The furthest I could see it going is a kiss on the cheek, but knowing my daughter, even that's unlikely. But still. It's her growing up and I am not feeling ready for it!","Tonight's a milestone and it's nerve wrackingMy daughter (13) is going on her first date. They're going to his school's homecoming game.

Our 5 y/o melted our hearts in the car,Parenting,1781,d84cn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/d84cn7/our_5_yo_melted_our_hearts_in_the_car/,72,1569261224.0,"The other day, our son (1 year old) was cranky in the car. He would not stop crying. We tried our usual go to‚Äôs and nothing worked. We were less than 10 minutes from home and decided to let him cry it out. Our daughter (5 years old) started singing ‚ÄúHow Far I‚Äôll Go‚Äù from the Moana sound track. This stopped the crying almost instantly! She sang for about a minute and he was silent. After a few moments of silence, he began crying again. We asked our daughter to sing again. She did and he stopped! 

IMO one of the best part of raising our children is watching them developed such a close bond. When this happened, my SO and I looked at each other and melted!","Our 5 y/o melted our hearts in the carThe other day, our son (1 year old) was cranky in the car. He would not stop crying.
