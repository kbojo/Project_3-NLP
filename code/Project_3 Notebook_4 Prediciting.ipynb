He isn't sleeping through the night and I never get breaks without him. He was a happy baby, hardly cried, and would go long stretches of time where he would play without me. He's had an ear infection for 10 days. It's being treated. My sweet boy has turned into a monster. He is fussy all the time, cries a lot, and screams a lot. I can't put him down for very long if at all. His sleep is even worse now. He doesn't like to be worn. He always wants me to hold him but then he wants to crawl all over me and try to grab things he's not supposed to have. I don't know what to do. I'm losing my mind. I'm exhausted. His cries and screams make me irrationally angry most of the time. I don't know what to do. I hate feeling this way. I love my baby and I used to love spending time with him.</td>\n",

       "340  I'm at my wits ends.My LO is 8 months old. I've been practicing attachment parenting as much as possible. We sleep together, I breastfeed him, wear him, never let him cry (unless we are in the car). For a while this had worked really well. But I'm exhausted. He isn't sleeping through the night and I never get breaks without him. He was a happy baby, hardly cried, and would go long stretches of time where he would play without me. He's had an ear infection for 10 days. It's being treated. My sweet boy has turned into a monster. He is fussy all the time, cries a lot, and screams a lot. I can't put him down for very long if at all. His sleep is even worse now. He doesn't like to be worn. He always wants me to hold him but then he wants to crawl all over me and try to grab things he's not supposed to have. I don't know what to do. I'm losing my mind. I'm exhausted. His cries and screams make me irrationally angry most of the time. I don't know what to do. I hate feeling this way. I love my baby and I used to love spending time with him.    \n",

       "      <td>Dinner battles with my toddler. Feeling like a failureI am completely ashamed of a number of recent failures in good parenting. I'm looking for advice on how other attachment parents think I could have handled these situations differeny.\\n\\nMy son is 2.5 and very communicative, which is awesome, but it means sometimes I mistakenly have higher expectations of him than what is reasonable for his age. He got into a habit of asking me to do something and then changing his mind and basically playing a game of saying \"mummy get this\" then \"I don't want that, get this\" or \"mummy leave\" and then telling me to come back. I know it's totally normal behaviour but it was driving me batshit crazy so I had the idea one night that I would try to use storytelling to help him understand why this isn't a good thing to do. I told him the folktale of the boy who cried wolf one night around bedtime. He was very captivated and asked me to tell it again. So I did. Now my son has nightmares about wolves coming into his room. Enormous failure and I feel so sad that I caused his bad dreams. Heartbreaking.\\n\\nI thought that would be my all time low, but I outdid myself tonight. For the past several days my son has been too distracted or uninterested or whatever to eat his dinner. Sometimes it's because he doesn't like it, other times just not wanting to sit still long enough to eat. Then at bedtime when he's doing his usual song and dance of excuses not to go to sleep, he's telling me he's hungry and wants a peanut butter sandwich. One night it was 3 peanut butter sandwiches. \\n\\nSo I thought it would be wise to try to be more of a stickler to eating his dinner and tonight we had a meal that he would normally be very interested in but wasn't even trying anything. I told him his only bedtime snack was going to be the dinner he didn't eat and when bedtime came around and he started begging for pickles, I told him he had to eat his dinner first. So he ate some, then I let him have some pickles and then he demanded more pickles and he said he would have to eat more dinner. He said he didn't want to so I said we can just go to sleep then. This is already 30 minutes past his normal bedtime. \\n\\nI lay down with him to get him to sleep and 2 minutes later he demands that I go get him his dinner. So I make very clear to him that I really don't want to get up to go get his dinner just to have him refuse it when I come back (his usual shenanigans). He says he wants to eat it so I get it and of course the second I come back he says he doesn't want it and wants to play, eat pickles, etc instead.\\n\\nWell sadly this is when I start to lose my cool and I hold firm that he eat it since he made me go get it. With much protesting he eats a few bites, spills half of it on the bed, and demands pickles. I tell him he has to have one more bite of his pork. He chews it for a bit and then starts spitting it out and I'm so mad by now that I tell him he needs to finish it and to put it back in his mouth. Well of course I should have realized he was trying to spit it out for a reason...\\n\\nHe gags on the bite and barfs all over me. \\n\\nNow I'm feeling like shit because I clearly am not being a good parent if I'm force feeding my kid to the point he makes himself ill. He's upset. we're both covered in puke. My husband comes to help clean up but after I get my son changed into new jammies and set up with a bowl of pickles because I feel so guilty, I have a full on mental breakdown in front of him. Oh btw I'm 6mo pregnant and just a complete wreck.\\n\\nHere's the kicker. I lay down in bed next to my son while my husband feeds him pickles, facing away to try to disguise my sobs and my sweet sweet boy snuggles up to my back and rubs my arm to try to make feel better.\\n\\nSo tell me have you ever failed your kid this hard? Have you ever broken down in front of them (I'll admit, not my first time)? How would you have handled those two situations differently? I want to be better at navigating these friction points in a way that doesn't make me feel like either a door mat or a meanie.\\n\\nThoughts?</td>\n",

With much protesting he eats a few bites, spills half of it on the bed, and demands pickles. I tell him he has to have one more bite of his pork. He chews it for a bit and then starts spitting it out and I'm so mad by now that I tell him he needs to finish it and to put it back in his mouth. Well of course I should have realized he was trying to spit it out for a reason...\\n\\nHe gags on the bite and barfs all over me. \\n\\nNow I'm feeling like shit because I clearly am not being a good parent if I'm force feeding my kid to the point he makes himself ill. He's upset. we're both covered in puke. My husband comes to help clean up but after I get my son changed into new jammies and set up with a bowl of pickles because I feel so guilty, I have a full on mental breakdown in front of him. Oh btw I'm 6mo pregnant and just a complete wreck.\\n\\nHere's the kicker. I lay down in bed next to my son while my husband feeds him pickles, facing away to try to disguise my sobs and my sweet sweet boy snuggles up to my back and rubs my arm to try to make feel better.\\n\\nSo tell me have you ever failed your kid this hard? Have you ever broken down in front of them (I'll admit, not my first time)? How would you have handled those two situations differently? I want to be better at navigating these friction points in a way that doesn't make me feel like either a door mat or a meanie.\\n\\nThoughts?   \n",
